(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)species of tapeworms can infect humans. Tapeworm dis-\nease or cestodiasis occurs most commonly after eatingraw or undercooked meat or fish that contains the imma-ture form of the tapeworm. \nDescription\nTapeworm infections pose a serious public health\nproblem in many less developed countries due to poor san-itation conditions. The disease is most common wherelivestock, such as cattle and pigs, are raised in areas wherehuman feces are not disposed of in a sanitary manner.Another common source of human tapeworms are certainspecies of freshwater fish. Tapeworm infections tend tooccur more frequently in areas of the world where the peo-ple regularly eat raw or undercooked beef, pork, or fish.Persons of all ages and both sexes are susceptible to tape-worm infection, but children are generally not exposeduntil they are old enough to begin eating meat or fish.\nTapeworm is less common in industrialized regions\nof the world, but travel to areas in which tapeworm infec-tions are more common and immigration of people fromthese areas serve as new sources of the parasite. Infectedpersons are often unaware of the presence of adult tape-worms in their intestinal tract, as they may have no obvi-ous symptoms of infection. Some tapeworms can live inan infected person for over 10 years if diagnosis is notmade and treatment is not administered.\nIn addition to the typical infection caused by eating\nundercooked meat or fish, people may also be directlyinfected by ingesting tapeworm eggs shed by the adultworm. This type of tapeworm infection can lead to a con-dition referred to as cysticercosis, in which the larvaecontinue to develop within tissues other than the intesti-nal tract. One of the most serious forms of this diseaseoccurs when the tapeworm larvae infect the central ner-vous system, a disease referred to as neurocysticercosis.In contrast to a typical tapeworm infection, which maynot be associated with symptoms, neurocysticercosis is aserious condition that may cause seizures and is poten-tially life-threatening. \nCauses and symptoms\nSeveral species of tapeworm can infect people. The\ntwo most common species are the pork tapeworm ( Taenia\nsolium ) and the beef tapeworm ( Taenia saginata ).\nImproperly treated human sewage may be used to fertilizepastures or crops. Pigs or cattle become infected by graz-ing in contaminated pastures or drinking water contami-nated with tapeworm eggs from human feces. The pea-sized larvae of these tapeworms are deposited in certaintissues of the body of infected pigs and cattle, includingthe muscles. The infection is then transmitted to peoplewhen raw or undercooked meat containing tapeworm lar-\nvae is consumed. The immature tapeworm develops intothe adult form in the human intestine and may remainthere for many years if not identified and treated.\nThe Taenia tapeworms attach to the intestinal walls\nbut cause only mild inflammation at the site of attach-ment. As a result, most tapeworm carriers show no symp-toms (asymptomatic) and usually become aware of theinfection only after noticing tapeworm segments in theirfeces. Segments of the beef tapeworm may spontaneous-ly pass through the anus causing a noticeable sensation.Mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea orabdominal pain , can occur in infected individuals. In\nrare cases where the tapeworm segments migrate into theappendix, pancreas, or bile duct, there may be a suddenonset of severe abdominal discomfort.\nCysticercosis is a potentially serious complication of\nTaenia solium infection in which the larvae develop out-\nside the intestinal tract. This type of infection is lesscommon and occurs following accidental consumptionof tapeworm eggs released from the adult worm. Theseeggs initially are localized in the anal area, but they mayalso contaminate the fingers or other parts of the body.Infection can occur in the person harboring the adulttapeworm or in other people with whom that individualcomes in contact. The tapeworm larvae may develop invarious tissues throughout the body. The most seriousclinical problems occur when the larvae develop in thecentral nervous system (neurocysticercosis), potentially\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3239Tapeworm diseases\nThe head of an adult beef tapeworm. (Custom Medical Stock\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)causing seizures and other neurological problems. An\nimportant aspect of this type of infection is that poorhygiene on the part of the individuals harboring an adulttapeworm can lead to an infection in an individual whomay never consume meat. This is a particular problem ifinfected individuals are employed as food handlers. \nAnother important tapeworm that may infect people\nis the fish tapeworm ( Diphyllobothrium latum ). This is a\nfrequent human intestinal parasite in many areas whereraw freshwater fish is consumed. Human infection withthe fish tapeworm is referred to as diphyllobothriasis.Feces from infected hosts or raw sewage contaminates afresh water source. Tapeworm larvae are initially ingest-ed by freshwater crustaceans and then are eaten by fish.Human infection occurs when a person consumes rawfish contaminated with the tapeworm larvae. Adult tape-worms then develop in the human intestinal tract.\nMost infections with the fish tapeworm are not associ-\nated with symptoms. The tapeworm causes little damage tothe lining of the intestine. Infected individuals may reportdiarrhea ,fatigue , weakness, or sensations of hunger more\ncommonly than uninfected individuals. One problemunique to this tapeworm is that it may compete with thehost for absorption of vitamin B\n12from the small intestine,\ncausing the person to become deficient in this vitamin andleading to a condition called pernicious anemia .\nTwo smaller species of tapeworms may also infect\npeople. The dwarf tapeworm ( Hymenolepis nana ) is a\ncommon infection throughout the world that can bepassed from one person to another. Transmission is usual-\nly the result of inadvertent ingestion of tapeworm eggsfrom feces eliminated by infected individuals. As a result,infection with this tapeworm is encountered most fre-quently in children, the developmentally disabled, andpsychiatric patient populations. Abdominal pain that isnot localized to any particular area is the most commoncomplaint. Patients may experience loose bowel move-ments or diarrhea with mucus, but bloody diarrhea is rare. \nAnother small tapeworm capable of infecting people\nis the rodent tapeworm ( Hymenolepis diminuta ). Rats,\nmice, and other rodents are the usual hosts for the adulttapeworm (definitive host), but humans can becomeinfected following accidental consumption of insectscontaining tapeworm larvae. Meal worms or grain bee-tles that infest cereal, flour, or dried fruit are the mostlikely source of infection. Most human infections are notassociated with symptoms, although some individualsreport headaches, anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea.\nDiagnosis\nIdentification of tapeworm segments or eggs in a stool\nsample is necessary for diagnosis of an adult tapeworminfection. In many cases, a tentative diagnosis may bemade on the basis of a patient’s description of short chainsof tapeworm segments in their stool. Further evaluation isrecommended to determine the actual species involvedsince infection with Taenia solium is potentially more seri-\nous due to the added risk of cysticercosis. Whenever possi-ble, tapeworm segments should be carefully collected inwater or salt solutions, using strict precautions to avoidcontamination. Stool examination should be performed ina laboratory having experience in the diagnosis of intesti-nal parasites. It is recommended that at least three stoolsamples be collected on alternate days to increase the like-lihood of being able to make an accurate diagnosis.\nAlthough the general appearance of tapeworm seg-\nments from the two Taenia species is quite similar, trained\nlaboratory personnel can detect distinct differencesbetween the beef and pork tapeworms when samples areexamined under a microscope. Tapeworm segments andeggs from the fish tapeworm and the dwarf tapewormhave characteristic appearances that allow accurate differ-entiation from the Taenia species of worms. Other diag-\nnostic procedures may be necessary when cysticercosis issuspected. Blood samples from an infected individual arecollected to look for the presence of antibodies against thetapeworm larvae. In cases in which infection of the cen-tral nervous system is present, advanced imaging tests,such as computed tomography scans and magnetic res-\nonance imaging (MRI), may be necessary to determine\nthe exact location of the tapeworm larvae within the body.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3240Tapeworm diseases\nThe head of an adult pork tapeworm. (Custom Medical Stock\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)Treatment\nEffective treatment of tapeworm infections involves\nadministering compounds that are toxic to the adultworm. Many of the early treatments were also somewhattoxic to the patient, so treatment was often quite anordeal. Newer medications are much more easily tolerat-ed and are highly effective in eliminating the parasitefrom the body.\nOne treatment that has been in use since the early\n1960s is niclosamide (Niclocide). This drug is poorlyabsorbed from the digestive tract and rapidly kills tape-worms upon exposure. It has been shown to be effectiveagainst Taenia species and the fish tapeworm, but treat-\nment of the dwarf tapeworm ( Hymenolepis nana ) may\nrequire a more prolonged treatment schedule. Sideeffects reported with niclosamide are infrequent and typ-ically mild. When present, side effects may include nau-sea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, light-KEY TERMS\nCestodiasis —Parasitic infection caused by the\npresence of adult tapeworms of the class Cestodawithin the intestinal tract. Infection is caused byaccidental consumption of tapeworm larvae.\nCysticercosis —Parasitic infection caused by the\npresence of immature tapeworm larvae (cysticerci)that have developed outside the intestinal tract.Infection is caused by accidental consumption oftapeworm eggs.\nDiphyllobothriasis —Parasitic infection caused by\nthe presence of tapeworms from the Diphylloboth-\nrium genus, such as the fish tapeworm ( Diphyl-\nlobothrium latum ). \nHymenolepiasis —Parasitic infection caused by the\npresence of tapeworms from the Hymenolepis\ngenus, such as the dwarf tapeworm ( Hymenolepis\nnana ) or the rodent tapeworm ( Hymenolepis\ndiminuta ).\nNeurocysticercosis —Parasitic infection caused by\nthe presence of immature tapeworm larvae withinthe central nervous system.\nPernicious anemia —Type of anemia caused by a\ndeficiency in vitamin B\n12.\nTaeniasis —Parasitic infection caused by the pres-\nence of tapeworms from the Taenia genus, such as\nthe pork tapeworm ( Taenia solium ) or the beef\ntapeworm ( Taenia saginata ).headedness, and skin rash. This medication should be\ntaken in the morning on an empty stomach. The tabletsare chewed thoroughly and swallowed with water. Foryoung children, the tablets may be pulverized and mixedwith water. Patients are allowed to eat two hours aftertreatment. Recommended dosage is 2 grams for adultsand about half this for children.\nAnother oral medication that has been shown to be\n95% effective in the treatment of tapeworm infectionsassociated with both Taenia and Diphyllobothrium latum\nspecies is praziquantel (Biltricide). Side effects reportedfor praziquantel are mild and appear to be short-lived.They include nausea, abdominal pain, itching , sore\njoints, and muscle pain.\nIt is recommended that follow-up stool samples be\nexamined at one month and three months after treatmenthas been completed. Treatment can be considered success-ful if no eggs are present in several stool samples. It shouldbe noted that the tapeworm medications do not kill the tape-worm eggs when they kill the adult worm, so the potentialfor infection with eggs still exists as the dead worm seg-ments are passed. Proper personal hygiene in individualsreceiving treatment will greatly reduce this potential.\nCases of neurocysticercosis, where larvae have devel-\noped in the central nervous system, may also be treatedwith praziquantel or albendazole. If the patient is treatedpromptly, damage to the central nervous system will beminimized.\nPrognosis\nWhen confined to the intestinal tract, tapeworms\ncause minimal damage to their human host. Once thediagnosis of an intestinal tapeworm infection has beenmade, prognosis following treatment with niclosamide orpraziquantel is good. The worms can be eliminated fromthe intestines with oral treatment, and there are usuallyno residual side effects. Serious problems from tape-worm infections occur when tapeworm eggs are con-sumed and the larvae localize in tissues outside thedigestive tract (cysticercosis). Prompt diagnosis andtreatment of this condition is necessary to prevent perma-nent damage to the central nervous system and otherinternal organs. Untreated cases of cysticercosis have therare potential to be life-threatening.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent infection with tapeworms\nis to eliminate the exposure of livestock to the tape-worm eggs by properly disposing of human feces. Thenext best strategy is to thoroughly cook or freeze allmeat and fish before it is eaten to prevent consumption\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3241Tapeworm diseasesof live tapeworm larvae in infected samples.

    "title": "Tardive dyskinesia",
    "content": "Tardive dyskinesia\nDefinition\nTardive dyskinesia is a mostly irreversible neurolog-\nical disorder of involuntary movements caused by long-term use of antipsychotic or neuroleptic drugs.\nDescription\nAntipsychotic or neuroleptic drugs are powerful\ntranquilizers generally prescribed for serious psychiatricdisorders, as well as neurological and gastrointestinaldisorders. Some common antipsychotics are: chlorpro-mazine HCl (Thorazine), thioridazine HCl (Mellaril),haloperidol (Haldol), perphenazine (Trilafon), thiothix-ene (Navane), trifluoperazine HCl (Stelazine), andfluphenazine HCl (Permitil, Prolixin).\nWhen these drugs are used long term, tardive dyski-\nnesia (TD) can result. About 20 percent of people takingantipsychotic drugs for more then one year become\naffected by TD. The prevalence of TD tends to be highestamong elderly patients and among women.Causes and symptoms\nTD usually appears after years of antipsychotic drug\nuse, and seems to be related to the total lifetime dose ofmedication. The symptoms include the following:\n• tongue protrusion• grimacing• rapid eye blinking\n• lip smacking, pursing, or puckering\n• rapid movement of the arms or legs• other involuntary movements of the head, face, neck\nand tongue muscles\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of TD is suspected upon observation\nof involuntary movements of the head, neck, face, andtongue in individuals who have a history of antipsychoticdrug prescription.\nTreatment\nThere is no standard treatment for TD. The primary\napproach is to discontinue or minimize the use ofantipsychotic drugs while attempting to treat some of thesymptoms. The treatment must be individualized to thepatient, because discontinuation of the antipsychoticdrug(s) may not be advisable, depending on the patient’scondition. In some cases, substituting another drug forthe antipsychotic drug may be beneficial.\nPrognosis\nOnce TD appears in full-blown form, it can be per-\nmanent. With careful management, some symptoms mayimprove and even disappear with time. In less severecases, some patients may recover from TD within threemonths of discontinuing the use of antipsychotic medica-tion. Studies report that at least half of patients experi-ence remission of major symptoms within 12 to 18months following discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs.In some patients, however, decreasing the dose of theantipsychotic drug actually increases the symptoms ofTD, while increasing the dose sometimes offers a tempo-rary remission of the symptoms.\nPrevention\nTD can be prevented by early recognition and dis-\ncontinuation of the antipsychotic medication if this isclinically possible. The use of antipsychotic drugsshould in any case be kept to a minimum in all patients.Patients should be followed carefully to determine when\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3242Tardive dyskinesiathe dose of the drug can be tapered off as the psychiatric\ncondition improves. In all cases, the benefits of takingthe antipsychotic medication should outweigh the risk ofdeveloping TD.\nA study has shown that elderly institutionalized\npatients with dementia that were treated with risperi-\ndone had a low incidence of TD. Although further studyis needed, this study shows that non-conventional neu-roleptic drugs should be considered to avoid the risk oftardive dyskinesia, particularly in elderly patients.\nResources\nBOOKS\nTasman, Allan.

    "content": "Tarsorrhaphy\nDefinition\nTarsorrhaphy is a rare procedure where the eyelids\nare partially sewn together to narrow the opening.KEY TERMS\nAntipsychotics —Drugs used to treat psychotic\nconditions such as schizophrenia or psychosis.These medications are powerful tranquilizers thatall have sedating and calming effects, but theirmajor effect is to reduce psychotic thinking andbehavior.\nNeuroleptics —Any of a class of drugs used to treat\npsychotic conditions.\nPsychosis —A condition where a person’s ability to\nrecognize reality and cope with everyday life isseverely affected.Purpose\nThe eye needs a lid to protect it. It also needs tears\nand periodic blinking to cleanse it and keep it moist.There are many conditions that impair these functionsand threaten the eye, specifically the cornea, with drying.Until they can be corrected, sewing the eyelids partiallytogether helps protect the eye.\nA partial list of the conditions that can require tars-\norrhaphy includes:\n• Paralysis or weakness of the eyelids so that they cannot\nclose or blink adequately. Bell’s palsy is a nerve condi-\ntion that weakens the muscles of the face, including theeyelids. It is usually temporary. Myasthenia gravis\nalso weakens facial muscles, but it is usually treatable.A stroke can also weaken eyelids so they do not close. \n• Exophthalmos (the eyes sticking out of their sockets)\noccurs with Graves’ disease of the thyroid and withtumors behind the eyes. If the eyes stick out too far, thelids cannot close over them. \n• Enophthalmos is a condition in which the eye falls back\ninto the socket so that the eyelid function is inadequate. \n• Several eye and corneal diseases cause swelling of the\ncornea and require temporary added protection until thecondition resolves. \n• Sjögren’s syndrome reduces tear flow to the point\nwhere it can endanger the cornea. \n• Dendritic ulcers of the cornea caused by viruses may\nneed to be covered with the eyelid while they heal.\nPrecautions\nThe use of eye drops and contact lenses to moisten\nand protect the eyes must be considered first before tars-orrhaphy is performed.\nDescription\nStitches are carefully placed at the corners of the\neyelid opening (called the palpebral fissure) to narrow it.This allows the eye better lubrication and less exposureto the air. Eyeball motion can then help bathe the corneain tears when it rolls up under the lid. The outpatient pro-cedure is done under local anesthetic.\nPreparation\nTarsorrhaphy is a minor procedure done under local\nanesthesia. Special preparation is not necessary.\nAftercare\nEye drops or ointment may still be needed to pre-\nserve the cornea or treat accompanying disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3243TarsorrhaphyRisks\nTarsorrhaphy carries few risks.

This results in dis-ability and death .\nDescription\nGangliosides are fatty substances necessary for the\nproper development of the brain and nerve cells (nervoussystem). Under normal conditions, gangliosides are con-tinuously broken down, so that an appropriate balance ismaintained.

About one out of every 3,600 babies born toAshkenazi Jewish couples will have the disease. Tay-Sachs is also more common among certain French-Cana-dian and Cajun French families.\nCauses and symptoms\nTay-Sachs is caused by a defective gene. Genes are\nlocated on chromosomes, and serve to direct specific devel-opment/processes within the body. The genetic defect inTay-Sachs disease results in the lack of an enzyme calledhexosaminidase A. Without this enzyme, gangliosides can-not be degraded. They build up within the brain, interferingwith nerve functioning. Because Tay-Sachs is a recessivedisorder, only people who receive two defective genes (onefrom the mother and one from the father) will actually havethe disease. People who have only one defective gene andone normal gene are called carriers. They carry the defec-tive gene and thus the possibility of passing the gene and/orthe disease onto their offspring.\nWhen a carrier and a non-carrier have children, none\nof their children will actually have Tay-Sachs. It is likelythat 50% of their children will be carriers themselves.When two carriers have children, their children have a25% chance of having normal genes, a 50% chance ofbeing carriers of the defective gene, and a 25% chance ofhaving two defective genes. The two defective genescause the disease itself.\nClassic Tay-Sachs disease strikes infants around the\nage of six months. Up until this age, the baby will appearto be developing normally. When Tay-Sachs begins toshow itself, the baby will stop interacting with other peo-ple and develop a staring gaze. Normal levels of noisewill startle the baby to an abnormal degree. By about oneyear of age, the baby will have very weak, floppy mus-cles, and may be completely blind. The head will bequite large. Patients also present with loss of peripheral(side) vision, inability to breath and swallow, and paral-\nysisas the disorder progresses. Seizures become a prob-\nlem between ages one and two, and the baby usually diesby about age four.\nA few variations from this classical progression of\nTay-Sachs disease are possible:\n• Juvenile hexosaminidase A deficiency. Symptoms\nappear between ages two and five; the disease progress-es more slowly, with death by about 15 years. \n• Chronic hexosaminidase A deficiency. Symptoms may\nbegin around age five, or may not occur until age\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3244Tay-Sachs disease20–30. The disease is milder. Speech becomes slurred.\nThe individual may have difficulty walking due toweakness, muscle cramps, and decreased coordinationof movements. Some individuals develop mental ill-ness. Many have changes in intellect, hearing, or vision.\nDiagnosis\nExamination of the eyes of a child with Tay-Sachs\ndisease will reveal a characteristic cherry-red spot at theback of the eye (in an area called the retina). Tests todetermine the presence and quantity of hexosaminidaseA can be performed on the blood, specially treated skincells, or white blood cells. A carrier will have about halfof the normal level of hexosaminidase A present, while apatient with the disease will have none.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment for Tay-Sachs disease.\nPrognosis\nSadly, the prognosis for a child with classic Tay-\nSachs disease is certain death. Because the chronic formof Tay-Sachs has been discovered recently, prognosis forthis type of the disease is not completely known.\nPrevention\nPrevention involves identifying carriers of the dis-\nease and providing them with appropriate informationconcerning the chance of their offspring having Tay-Sachs disease. When the levels of hexosaminidase A arehalf the normal level, a person is a carrier of the defectivegene. Blood tests of carriers reveals reduction of hex-osaminidase A.\nWhen a woman is already pregnant, tests can be per-\nformed on either the cells of the baby (aminocentesis) orthe placenta (chorionic villus sampling) to determinewhether the baby will have Tay-Sachs disease.\nResources\nBOOKS\nNelson Textbook of Pediatrics, edited by Richard Behrman.\nPhiladelphia: W.B.

    "content": "Technetium heart scan\nDefinition\nThe technetium heart scan is a noninvasive nuclear\nscan that uses a radioactive isotope called technetium toevaluate blood flow after a heart attack .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3245Technetium heart scan\nSection of brain tissue from patient with Tay-Sachs disease.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)KEY TERMS\nGanglioside —A fatty (lipid) substance found with-\nin the brain and nerve cells.Purpose\nThe technetium heart scan is used to evaluate the\nheart after a heart attack. It can confirm that a patient hada heart attack when the symptoms and pain usually asso-\nciated with a heart attack were not present; identify thesize and location of the heart attack; and provide infor-mation useful in determining the patient’s post-heartattack prognosis. The scan is most useful when the elec-trocardiogram and cardiac enzyme studies do not providedefinitive results—after heart surgery, for example, orwhen chest pain occurred more than 48 hours before thepatient was examined. It is also used to evaluate the heartbefore and after heart surgery.\nPrecautions\nPregnant women and those who are breastfeeding\nshould not be exposed to technetium.\nDescription\nThe technetium heart scan is a nuclear heart scan,\nwhich means that it involves the use of a radioactive iso-tope that targets the heart, and a radionuclide detectorthat traces the absorption of the radioactive isotope. Theisotope is injected into a vein and absorbed by healthytissue at a known rate during a certain time period. Theradionuclide detector, in this case a gamma scintillationcamera, picks up the gamma rays emitted by the isotope.\nThe technetium heart scan uses technetium Tc-99m\nstannous pyrophosphate (usually called technetium), amildly radioactive isotope that binds to calcium. After aheart attack, tiny calcium deposits appear on diseasedheart valves and damaged heart tissue. These depositsappear within 12 hours of the heart attack. They are gen-erally seen two to three days after the heart attack and areusually gone within one to two weeks. In some patients,they can be seen for several months.\nAfter the technetium is injected into a blood vessel\nin the arm, it accumulates in heart tissue that has beendamaged, leaving “hot spots” that can be detected by thescintillation camera. The technetium heart scan providesbetter image quality than commonly used radioactiveagents such as thallium, because it has a shorter half-lifeand can thus be given in larger doses.\nDuring the test, the patient lies motionless on the test\ntable. Electrocardiogram electrodes are placed on thepatient’s body for continuous monitoring during the test.The test table is rotated so that different views of theheart can be scanned. The camera, which looks like an x-ray machine and is suspended above the table, movesback and forth over the patient. It displays a series ofimages of technetium’s movement through the heart and\nrecords them on a computer for later analysis.\nThe test is usually performed at least 12 hours after a\nsuspected heart attack, but it can also be done duringtriage of a patient who goes to a hospital emergency roomwith chest pain but does not appear to have had a heartattack. Recent clinical studies demonstrate that tech-netium heart scans are very accurate in detecting heartattacks while the patient is experiencing chest pain. Theyare far more accurate than electrocardiogram findings.\nThe technetium heart scan is usually performed in a\nhospital’s nuclear medicine department but it can bedone at the patient’s bedside during a heart attack if theequipment is available. The scan is done two to threehours after the technetium is injected. Scans are usuallydone with the patient in several positions, with each scantaking 10 minutes. The entire test takes about 30 minutesto an hour. The scan is usually repeated over severalweeks to determine if any further damage has been doneto the heart. The test is also called technetium 99mpyrophosphate scintigraphy, hot-spot myocardial imag-ing, infarct avid imaging, or myocardial infarction scan.\nThe technetium heart scan is not dangerous. The\ntechnetium is completely gone from the body within afew days of the test. The scan itself exposes the patient toabout the same amount of radiation as a chest x ray . The\npatient can resume normal activities immediately afterthe test.\nPreparation\nTwo to three hours before the scan, technetium is\ninjected into a vein in the patient’s forearm.\nNormal results\nIf the technetium heart scan is normal, no tech-\nnetium will show up in the heart.\nAbnormal results\nIn an abnormal technetium heart scan, hot spots\nreveal damage to the heart.

It is produced during nuclear fissionreactions.disrupts this blood supply, resulting in a variety of symp-\ntoms. They can range from relatively minor—jaw pain\nor headache—through major— including temporary orpermanent blindness.\nTemporal arteritis is also called giant cell arteritis or\ncranial arteritis. It is a rheumatic disease that affects largeand medium-sized arteries throughout the body and canoccur in a variety of patients. Although the temporalarteries are most commonly affected, other arteriesthroughout the body may be affected. The disease seemsto target arteries containing elastic tissue. Veins arerarely affected. Temporal arteritis is a type of vasculitis .\nDescription\nTemporal arteritis almost always occurs in people\nover 50, and it becomes more common as people age.About 20 out of 100,000 people over the age of 50 sufferfrom temporal arteritis. Women are affected twice asoften as men. Some authorities say that temporal arteritisis more common in Caucasians (especially Scandina-vians) than in people of other races. Close relatives ofpatients with temporal arteritis may be more likely thanothers to get the disease.\nPatients with temporal arteritis are diagnosed and\noverlap with a broader disorder called giant cell arteritis.This can affect parts of the body in addition to the scalp,eyes, and jaw. Sometimes the disease can cause restrictedcirculation to both arms or both legs, producing pain inthe affected limbs. With other blood vessels involved,patients with advanced forms of the disease may experi-ence strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIA). Theseresult in brief episodes of pain caused by decreasedblood flow. Even heart attacks are occasionally causedby giant cell arteritis.\nCauses and symptoms\nThis disease is one of a group of diseases in which the\nlinings of large- or medium-sized blood vessels becomeinflamed. The elastic layer of these vessels is attacked by“giant” cells and chemicals produced by the immune sys-tem. This reaction reduces blood flow through the bloodvessels, and the limited blood supply causes the symptoms. \nThe disease usually begins with “flu-like” symptoms,\nincluding a mild fever (100–101°F), general body discom-\nfort, and a persistent, dull headache . The scalp may be ten-\nder to the touch over the affected blood vessels. Jaw mus-cles sometimes become painful when the patient chews.\nAs the disease progresses, more severe symptoms\noccur. These include blurred vision or temporary blind-ness that typically lasts ten minutes or less. Eventually,permanent loss of vision can occur. Transient ischemic\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3247Temporal arteritisattacks, strokes, and heart attacks may occur when the\ndisease is far advanced.\nDiagnosis\nDoctors from a number of specialties develop expe-\nrience in diagnosing and treating temporal arteritis.These include internists, who treat a broad range of dis-eases; rheumatologists, who focus on rheumatic dis-eases; geriatricians, who treat older people; ophthalmol-ogists, who treat eye and vision disorders; neurologists,who treat headaches and problems of the optic nerve; andvascular surgeons, who treat blood vessel problems.\nThe doctor will generally take a medical history\nfirst. The patient can help the doctor tremendously byreviewing all symptoms—both major and minor—fromthe last two or three months. If possible, the patientshould ask family or close friends for help in recallinghis/her ailments from recent months. Then the doctorwill conduct a complete physical examination . Often,\nhe or she will detect a tender, swollen artery on the scalp.\nThe doctor will order blood tests as well. A standard\nand inexpensive test called the erythrocyte sedimenta-\ntion rate (ESR or “sed” rate) is particularly helpful.\nResults from this test, which measures inflammation inthe body, will almost always be higher than normal. Testsof the red blood cells may show mild anemia. Sometimesblood tests for liver function will also be abnormal.\nThe definitive diagnostic test is a temporal artery\nbiopsy. A doctor will make one or more tiny incisionsunder local anesthesia to remove samples of the suspectartery. Under the microscope, a pathologist usually canidentify the typical damage caused by temporal arteritis.\nTreatment\nThe mainstay of treatment is a course of corticos-\nteroids (steroid hormones that have an anti-inflammatory\neffect), usually prednisone. The initial prescriptioninvolves a fairly high dose of steroids (40–60 mg/day)which is gradually tapered down to a maintenance dose.Because of the high incidence of blindness in untreatedcases, steroid therapy should be started immediately ratherthan waiting for biopsy results. Patients typically take thismaintenance dose for periods of one to three years. Some-times nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nare prescribed for muscle aches or headaches, especiallywhile steroid doses are being reduced.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for most patients with temporal arteritis\nis good, especially if the disorder is diagnosed early.Symptoms often diminish within a month once patientsbegin to take steroids.

Lampert\nTemporomandibular joint\ndisorders\nDefinition\nTemporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) is the name\ngiven to a group of symptoms that cause pain in the head,\nface, and jaw. The symptoms include headaches, soreness inthe chewing muscles, and clicking or stiffness of the joints.They often have psychological as well as physical causes.\nDescription\nTMJ disorder, which is also sometimes called TMJ\nsyndrome, results from pressure on the facial nerves dueto muscle tension or abnormalities of the bones in thearea of the hinge joint between the lower jaw and thetemporal bone. This hinge joint is called the temporo-mandibular joint. There are two temporomandibularjoints, one on each side of the skull just in front of theear. The name of the joint comes from the two bones thatmake it up. The temporal bone is the name of the sectionof the skull bones where the jaw bone (the mandible) isconnected. The jaw bone is held in place by a combina-tion of ligaments, tendons, and muscles. The temporo-mandibular joint also contains a piece of cartilage calleda disc, which keeps the temporal bone and the jaw bonefrom rubbing against each other. The jaw pivots at thejoint area in front of the ear. The pivoting motion of thejaw is complicated because it can move downward andfrom side to side as well as forward. Anything that caus-es a change in shape or functioning of the temporo-mandibular joint will cause pain and other symptoms.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nTMJ syndrome has several possible physical causes:\n• Muscle tension. Muscle tightness in the temporomandibu-\nlar joint usually results from overuse of muscles. Thisoveruse in turn is often associated with psychologicalstress and clenching or grinding of the teeth ( bruxism ). \n• Injury. A direct blow to the jaw or the side of the head\ncan result in bone fracture, soft tissue bruising, or a dis-location of the temporomandibular joint itself. \n• Arthritis. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthri-\ntiscan cause TMJ. • Internal derangement. Internal derangement is a condi-\ntion in which the cartilage disk lies in front of its properposition. In most cases of internal derangement, thedisc moves in and out of its correct location, making aclicking or popping noise as it moves. In a few cases,the disc is permanently out of position, and the patient’srange of motion in the jaw is limited. \n• Hypermobility. Hypermobility is a condition in which\nthe ligaments that hold the jaw in place are too looseand the jaw tends to slip out of its socket. \n• Birth abnormalities. These are the least frequent cause\nof TMJ but do occur in a minority of patients. In somecases, the top of the jawbone is too small; in others, thetop of the jawbone outgrows the lower part.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of TMJ depend in part on its cause.\nThe most common symptoms are facial pain in front ofthe ears; headaches; sore jaw muscles; a clicking soundwhen chewing; a grating sensation when opening andclosing the mouth; and temporary locking of the jaw.Some patients also report a sensation of buzzing or ring-ing in the ears. Usually, the temporomandibular jointitself is not painful. Most cases of TMJ are seen inwomen between 20-50 years of age.\nDiagnosis\nDental examination and patient history\nTMJ disorders are most frequently diagnosed by\ndentists. The dentist can often diagnose TMJ based onphysical examination of the patient’s face and jaw. The\nexamination might include pressing on (palpating) thejaw muscles for soreness or asking the patient to openand close the jaw in order to check for misalignment ofthe teeth in the upper and lower jaw. This condition iscalled malocclusion . The dentist might also gently move\nthe patient’s jaw in order to check for loose ligaments.\nImaging studies\nImaging studies are not usually necessary to diag-\nnose TMJ. In most cases, x rays and MRI scans of thetemporomandibular joint will be normal. Consequently,these two tests are not commonly used to diagnoseTMJ. If the dentist suspects that the patient has internalderangement of the disc, he or she can use a techniquecalled arthrography to make the diagnosis. In an\narthrogram, a special dye is injected into the joint,which is then x-rayed. Arthrography can be used toevaluate the movement of the jaw and the disc as wellas size and shape, and to evaluate the effectiveness oftreatment for TMJ.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3249Temporomandibular joint disordersTreatment\nIn many cases, the cause of pain in the TMJ area is\ntemporary and disappears without treatment. About 80%of patients with TMJ will improve in six months withoutmedications or physical treatments.\nMedications\nPatients with TMJ can be given muscle relaxants if\ntheir symptoms are related to muscle tension. Somepatients may be given aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for minor discomfort. If\nthe TMJ is related to rheumatoid arthritis, it may be treat-ed with corticosteroids , methotrexate (MTX, Rheuma-\ntrex) or gold sodium (Myochrysine).KEY TERMS\nArthrography —An imaging technique that is\nsometimes used to evaluate TMJ associated withinternal derangement.\nBruxism —Habitual clenching and grinding of the\nteeth, especially during sleep.\nElectromyographic biofeedback —A method for\nrelieving jaw tightness by monitoring the patient’sattempts to relax the muscle while the patientwatches a gauge. The patient gradually learns tocontrol the degree of muscle relaxation.\nInternal derangement —A condition in which the\ncartilage disc in the temporomandibular joint liesin front of its proper position.\nMalocclusion —The misalignment of opposing\nteeth in the upper and lower jaws.\nMandible —The medical name for the lower jaw.\nOsteoarthritis —A type of arthritis marked by\nchronic degeneration of the cartilage of the joints,leading to pain and sometimes loss of function.\nRheumatoid arthritis —A chronic autoimmune\ndisorder marked by inflammation and deformity ofthe affected joints.\nTemporal bones —The compound bones that form\nthe left and right sides of the skull.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation —A\nmethod for relieving the muscle pain of TMJ bystimulating nerve endings that do not transmitpain. It is thought that this stimulation blocksimpulses from nerve endings that do transmit pain.Physical therapy and mechanical devices\nPatients who have difficulty with bruxism are usual-\nly treated with splints. A plastic splint called a night-guard is given to the patient to place over the teeth beforegoing to bed. Splints can also be used to treat some casesof internal derangement by holding the jaw forward andkeeping the disc in place until the ligaments tighten. Thesplint is adjusted over a period of two to four months.\nTMJ can also be treated with ultrasound, elec-\ntromyographic biofeedback , stretching exercises, tran-\nscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation , stress manage-\nment techniques, or friction massage.\nSurgery\nSurgery is ordinarily used only to treat TMJ caused\nby birth deformities or certain forms of internal derange-ment caused by misshapen discs.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from TMJ is excellent for\nalmost all patients. Most patients do not need any form oflong-term treatment. Surgical procedures to treat TMJ arequite successful. In the case of patients with TMJ causedby arthritis or infectious diseases, the progression of thearthritis or the success of eliminating infectious agentsdetermines whether TMJ can be eliminated.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Disorders of the Temporomandibular Joint.” In Merck Manual\nof Medical Information: Home Edition , ed.

    "content": "Tendinitis\nDefinition\nTendinitis is the inflammation of a tendon, a tough\nrope-like tissue that connects muscle to bone.\nDescription\nTendinitis usually occurs in individuals in middle or\nold age because it is often the result of overuse over a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3250Tendinitislong period of time. Tendinitis does occur in younger\npatients as a result of acute overuse.\nTendons that commonly become inflamed include:\n• tendons of the hand\n• tendons of the upper arm that effect the shoulder\n• achilles tendon and the tendon that runs across the top\nof the foot\nCauses and symptoms\nSudden stretching or repeated overuse injures the\nconnection between the tendon and its bone or muscle.The injury is largely mechanical, but when it appears, thebody tries to heal it by initiating inflammation. Inflamma-tion increases the blood supply, bringing nutrients to thedamaged tissues along with immunogenic agents to com-bat infection. The result is swelling, tenderness, pain ,\nheat, and redness if the inflammation is close to the skin.\nDiagnosis\nSome tendon injuries are superficial and easy to\nidentify. These include “tennis elbow” (extensor tendini-tis) over the outside of the elbow, and Achilles’ tendinitisjust above the heel of the foot. There are several tendonsin the shoulder that can be overused or stretched, andusually a shoulder will have more than one injury at atime. Tendinitis in the biceps, the infraspinatus, or thesupraspinatus tendon may accompany a tear of the shoul-der ligaments or an impingement of one bone on another.Careful pressure testing and movement of the parts is allthat is necessary to identify the tendinitis.\nTreatment\nRest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) will\ntreat the acute condition. The best way to apply ice is in abag with water. The water applies the cold directly to theskin. Chemical ice packs can get too cold and cause frost-bite. Compression using an elastic wrap minimizesswelling and bleeding in an acute sprain. Splinting mayhelp rest the limb. Pain and anti-inflammatory medications(aspirin , naproxen, ibuprofen) will help. Sometimes the\ninflammation lingers and requires additional treatment.Injections of cortisone-like medicine often relieve chronictendinitis, but should be reserved for resistant cases sincecortisone can occasionally cause problems of its own.\nIf tendinitis is persistent and unresponsive to nonsur-\ngical treatment, a surgery to remove the afflicted portionof tendon can be performed. Surgery is also conducted toremove calcium buildup that comes with persistent ten-dinitis. KEY TERMS\nBiceps —The muscle in the front of the upper arm.\nInfraspinatus —A muscle at the middle of the\nshoulder blade. \nSupraspinatus —A muscle at the top of the shoul-\nder blade. \nAlternative treatment\nAn osteopathic soft-tissue treatment on the tendon\nmay relieve pain and increase mobility. Increasing intakeof antioxidant-rich foods and lowering intake of animalfats may help reduce the inflammation. Acupuncture has\nalso been used to combat tendinitis. Hydrotherapies, suchas whirlpool baths, help relax the surrounding muscles. \nPrognosis\nGenerally, tendinitis will heal if the provoking activ-\nity is stopped. \nPrevention\nIf given enough time, tendons will strengthen to\nmeet the demands placed on them.

    "title": "Tennis elbow",
    "content": "Tennis elbow\nDefinition\nTennis elbow is an inflammation of several struc-\ntures of the elbow. These include muscles, tendons,bursa, periosteum, and epicondyle (bony projections onthe outside and inside of the elbow, where muscles of theforearm attach to the bone of the upper arm).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3251Tennis elbowDescription\nThe classic tennis elbow is caused by repeated force-\nful contractions of wrist muscles located on the outerforearm. The stress , created at a common muscle origin,\ncauses microscopic tears leading to inflammation. This isa relatively small surface area located at the outer portionof the elbow (the lateral epicondyle). Medial tenniselbow, or medial epicondylitis, is caused by forceful,repetitive contractions from muscles located on theinside of the forearm. All of the forearm muscles areinvolved in tennis serves, when combined motions of theelbow and wrist are employed. This overuse injury iscommon between ages 20 and 40.\nPeople at risk for tennis elbow are those in occupa-\ntions that require strenuous or repetitive forearm move-ment. Such jobs include mechanics or carpentry. Sportactivities that require individuals to twist the hand, wrist,and forearm, such as tennis, throwing a ball, bowling,golfing, and skiing, can cause tennis elbow. Individuals inpoor physical condition, who are exposed to repetitivewrist and forearm movements for long periods of time\nmay be prone to tennis elbow. This condition is alsocalled epicondylitis, lateral epicondylitis, medial epi-condylitis, or golfer’s elbow, where pain is present at the\ninside epicondyle.\nCauses and symptoms\nTennis elbow pain originates from a partial tear of\nthe tendon and the attached covering of the bone. It iscaused by chronic stress on tissues attaching forearmmuscles to the elbow area. Individuals experiencing ten-nis elbow may complain of pain and tenderness overeither of the two epicondyles. This pain increases withgripping or rotation of the wrist and forearm. If the con-dition becomes long-standing and chronic, a decrease ingrip strength can develop.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of tennis elbow includes the individual\nobservation and recall of symptoms, a thorough medicalhistory, and physical examination by a physician. Diag-\nnostic testing is usually not necessary unless there maybe evidence of nerve involvement from underlying caus-es. X rays are usually always negative because the condi-tion primarily affects soft tissue, in contrast to a bonydisorder.\nTreatment\nConservative\nHeat or ice is helpful in relieving tennis elbow\npain. Once acute symptoms have subsided, heat treat-\nments are used to increase blood circulation and pro-\nmote healing. The physician may recommend physicaltherapy to apply diathermy or ultrasound to theinflamed site. These are two common modalities usedto increase the temperature of the tissues in order toaddress both pain and inflammation. Occasionally, atennis elbow splint may be useful to help decreasestress on the elbow throughout daily activities. Exercis-es become very important to improve flexibility to allforearm muscles, and will aid in decreasing muscle andtendon tightness that has been creating excessive pull atthe common attachment of the epicondyle. The physi-cian may also prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-\ntory drugs (NSAIDS) to reduce inflammation and\npain. Injections of cortisone or anesthetics are oftenused if physical therapy is ineffective. Cortisonereduces inflammation, and anesthetics temporarilyrelieve pain. Physicians are cautious regarding exces-sive number of injections as they have recently beenfound to weaken the tendon’s integrity. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3252Tennis elbow\nEpicondylitisSmall tear in\ntendon tissue\nThe classic tennis elbow is caused by repeated forceful\ncontractions of wrist muscles located on the outer forearm.The stress created at a common muscle origin causesmicroscopic tears leading to inflammation. Persons who aremost at risk of developing tennis elbow are those whoseoccupations requires strenuous or repetitive forearm move-ment. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Surgery\nIf conservative methods of treatment fail, surgical\nrelease of the tendon at the epicondyle may be a neces-sary form of treatment. However, surgical intervention isrelatively rare.\nAlternative treatment\nMassage therapy has been found to be beneficial if\nsymptoms are mild. Massage techniques are based primar-ily on increasing circulation to promote efficient reductionof inflammation. Manipulation, acupuncture , and acu-\npressure have been used as well. Contrast hydrotherapy\n(alternating hot and cold water or compresses, three min-utes hot, 30 seconds cold, repeated three times, alwaysending with cold) applied to the elbow can help bringnutrient-rich blood to the joint and carry away waste prod-ucts. Botanical medicine and homeopathy may also be\neffective therapies for tennis elbow. For example, cayenne(Capsicum frutescens ) ointment or prickly ash ( Zanthoxy-\nlum americanum ) oil applied topically may help to\nincrease blood flow to the affected area and speed healing.\nPrognosis\nTennis elbow is usually curable; however, if symp-\ntoms become chronic, it is not uncommon for treatmentto continue for three to six months.\nPrevention\nUntil symptoms of pain and inflammation subside,\nactivities requiring repetitive wrist and forearm motionshould be avoided. Once pain decreases to the point thatreturn to activity can begin, the playing of sports, such astennis, for long periods should not occur until excellentcondition returns.

    "content": "Tensilon test\nDefinition\nTensilon is the trade name for edrophonium chlo-\nride. The Tensilon test is an injection of edrophoniumchloride used to diagnosis myasthenia gravis (MG).\nPurpose\nTensilon blocks the action of an enzyme, acetyl-\ncholinesterase, an important part of the system regulatingneuromuscular transmission. To stimulate a muscle, anerve cell (neuron) releases the chemical acetylcholine.To prevent prolonged muscle response to a single nervesignal, acetylcholine is broken down by acetyl-cholinesterase after the muscle is stimulated.\nIn myasthenia gravis, there are too few receptors for\nacetylcholine on the muscle. The acetylcholine is brokendown before it can fully stimulate this reduced number ofreceptors, and, as a result, the muscle is weak. By block-ing the action of acetylcholinesterase, Tensilon prolongsthe muscle stimulation, and temporarily improvesstrength. Increased strength following an injection ofTensilon strongly suggests a dignosis of MG. The Ten-silon test is most effective when easily observed weak-ness is present, and is less useful for vague or fluctuatingcomplaints.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3253Tensilon testPrecautions\nThe Tensilon test may cause heart rhythm abnormal-\nities, especially in those patients with preexisting condi-tions.\nDescription\nThe Tensilon test involves the intravenous injection\nof a small amount of Tensilon. The needle is left in place.If no adverse reaction is observed within 30 seconds, anadditional volume is injected. Results are apparent withinone minute.\nPreparation\nBefore the test, the patient must stop taking all drugs\nthat can inhibit acetylcholinesterase. The referring physi-cian can advise on specific drugs the patient is taking.\nAftercare\nThe effects of Tensilon subside quickly, and are\ncompletely gone after 30-60 minutes. No aftercare isneeded.\nRisks\nAtrial fibrillation and bradycardia are possible in\nsensitive individuals. The administering physician musthave appropriate resuscitative equipment available.\nNormal results\nIn a patient without MG, the Tensilon test will not\nproduce an obvious increase in a previously weak mus-cle.

    "content": "Tension headache\nDefinition\nThis most common type of headache is caused by\nsevere muscle contractions triggered by stress or exer-\ntion. It affects as many as 90% of adult Americans.\nDescription\nWhile most American adults get a tension headache\nfrom time to time, women and people with more educationare slightly more likely to suffer with them. People whoare so anxious that they grind their teeth or hunch theirshoulders may find that the physical strain in their bodycan be experienced as pain and tension in the muscles of\nthe neck and scalp, producing almost constant pain.\nCauses and symptoms\nTension headaches are caused by tightening in the\nmuscles of the face, neck and scalp because of stress orpoor posture. They can last for days or weeks and cancause pain of varying intensity. The tightening musclescause more expansion and constriction of blood vessels,which can make head pain worse. Eyestrain caused bydealing with a large amount of paperwork or reading cancause a tension headache as well.\nMany people report tension headache pain as a kind\nof steady ache (as opposed to a throb) that forms a tightband around the forehead, affecting both sides of thehead. Tension headaches usually occur in the front of thehead, although they also may appear at the top or theback of the skull.\nTension headaches often begin in late afternoon and\ncan last for several hours; they can occur every day andlast throughout most of the day. When this happens, theheadache is called a chronic tension headache. Unlikemigraines, tension headaches don’t cause nausea and\nvomiting , sensitivity to light, or any kind of aura before\nthe headache begins.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3254Tension headacheDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of tension headaches is made from a med-\nical history, discussion of symptoms, and elimination ofother types of headaches or underlying disorders. \nVery few headaches are the sign of a serious under-\nlying medical problem. However, sufferers should call aphysician at once if they:\n• have more than three headaches a week• take painkillers almost every day• need more than the recommended dose of painkiller• have a stiff neck and/or fever in addition to headache\n• are dizzy, unsteady, or have slurred speech, weakness,\nor numbness\n• have confusion or drowsiness with the headache\n• have headaches that began with a head injury• have headaches triggered by bending, coughing or exer-\ntion\n• have headaches that keep getting worse• have severe vomiting with the headache• had the first headache after age 50• awaken with headache that gets better as the day goes on\nTreatment\nThere are many different treatments for tension\nheadaches, which respond well to both medication andmassage. If these headaches become chronic, however,they are best treated by identifying the source of tensionand stress and reducing or eliminating it.\nMedication\nTension headaches usually respond very well to such\nover-the-counter medicines as aspirin , ibuprofen, or\nacetaminophen . However, some of these drugs (espe-\ncially those that contain caffeine ) may trigger rebound\nheadaches if discontinued after they are taken for morethan a few days.\nMore severe tension headaches may require combi-\nnation medications, including a mild sedative such asbutalbital; these should be used sparingly, though.Chronic tension headaches may respond to low-doseamitriptyline taken at night. \nMassage\nMassaging the tense muscle groups may help ease\npain. Instead of directly massaging the temple, patientswill get more relief from rubbing the neck and shoulders,because tension headaches can arise from tension in thisarea. In fact, relaxing the muscles of the neck can cut the\nintensity and duration of tension headaches at least in half.\nTo relax these muscles, the neck should be rotated\nfrom side to side as the shoulders shrug. Some peoplefind that imagining a sense of warmth or heaviness in theneck muscles can help. Taking three very deep breaths atthe first hint of tension can help prevent a headache.\nOther therapy\nIf tension headaches are a symptom of either depres-\nsion or anxiety , the underlying problem should be treat-\ned with counseling, medication, or a combination ofboth.\nAlternative treatment\nEliminating the source of the tension as much as\npossible will help prevent tension headaches. Acupunc-\nture may be helpful in treating some chronic tension\nheadaches. Homeopathic remedies and botanical medi-cine can also help relieve tension headaches. Valerian(Valeriana officinalis ), skullcap ( Scutellaria lateriflora ),\nand passionflower ( Passiflora incarnata ) are three herbal\nremedies that may be helpful. A tension headache canalso be relieved by soaking the feet in hot water while anice cold towel is wrapped around the neck.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3255Tension headache\nTension HeadacheMuscles\nAreas of pain\nTension headache is the most common type of headache,\ncaused by severe muscle contractions triggered by stressor exertion.Tension headaches usually occur in the front ofthe head, although they may also appear at the top or theback of the skull, as shown in the illustration above. (Illustra-\ntion by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Prognosis\nCutting down on stress and relying less on caffeine-\ncontaining medications can reduce the number of tensionheadaches for most people.\nPrevention\nTension headaches can often be prevented by manag-\ning everyday stress and making some important lifestylechanges.

    "title": "Testicular cancer",
    "content": "Testicular cancer\nDefinition\nTesticular cancer is a disease in which cancer cells\nare discovered in one or both testicles. The testicles, alsoknown as testes or gonads, are located in a pouch beneaththe penis called the scrotum.\nDescription\nThe testicles make up one portion of the male repro-\nductive system. Normally, they are each somewhatsmaller than a golf ball in size and are contained withinthe scrotum. The testicles are a man’s primary source ofmale hormones, particularly testosterone. They also pro-duce sperm.\nThere are several types of cells contained in the tes-\nticles, and any of these may develop into one or moretypes of cancer. Over 90% of all testicular cancers beginin cells called germ cells. There are two main types ofgerm cell tumors in men: seminomas and nonsemino-mas. Seminomas make up about 40% of all testiculargerm cell tumors. Nonseminomas make up a group ofcancers, which include choriocarcinoma , yolk sac\ntumors, embryonal carcinoma, and teratoma.\nAlthough testicular cancer accounts for less then\n2% of all cancers in men, it is the most commonly seencancer in young men aged 15 to 35. It is also one of themost curable.\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that approx-\nimately 7,200 new cases of testicular cancer will be diag-nosed in 2001. In addition, about 400 men will die of thedisease during that year. Though the incidence of testicu-lar cancer is rising, having doubled in the last 30 years, itis still rare. Scandinavian countries have the highest ratein the world. Germany and New Zealand also have highrates. The lowest incidences of testicular cancer are inAsia and Africa.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact causes of testicular cancer are unknown.\nHowever, there is research showing that some men aremore likely to acquire it than others. The risk for testicu-lar cancer is much higher for boys born with one or bothof their testicles located in the lower abdomen rather thanin the scrotum. This condition is called cryptorchidism orundescended testicles. The lifetime risk of getting testic-ular cancer is four times higher for boys with cryp-torchidism than the risk in the general population. Thisrisk factor remains even if surgery is done to place thetesticle back into the scrotum.\nThere are other risk factors as well. Men who have\nhad abnormal development of their testicles are atincreased risk, as are men with Klinefelter’s syndrome (adisorder of the sex chromosomes). A family history oftesticular cancer increases the possibility of getting thedisease. Men infected with the human immunodeficien-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3256Testicular cancercyvirus (HIV), especially those with AIDS , have a high-\ner incidence, as do infertile men. Certain testiculartumors appear more frequently among men who work incertain occupations, like miners, oil workers, and utilityworkers. There is no conclusive evidence that injuries tothe testicles or environmental exposure to various chemi-cals cause the disease.\nTesticular cancer usually shows no early symptoms.\nIt is suspected when a mass or lump is felt in the testes,although a testicular mass does not always indicate can-cer and is usually painless.\nSymptoms:\n• a lump in either testicle (usually pea-sized, but may be\nas large as a marble or an egg)\n• any enlargement or significant shrinking of a testicle\n• a sensation of heaviness in the scrotum\n• a dull ache in the groin or lower abdomen\n• any sudden collection of fluid in the scrotum\n• tenderness or enlargement of the breasts• pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotumDiagnosis\nWhen a man exhibits symptoms that suggest a possi-\nbility of testicular cancer, several diagnostic steps willoccur before a definitive diagnosis is made.\nHistory and physical\nThe physician takes a personal and family medical his-\ntory and a complete physical examination is performed.\nThe doctor will examine the scrotum as well as theabdomen and other areas to check for additional masses.\nUltrasound\nIf a mass is found, the physician will likely have an\nultrasound performed. Through the use of sound waves,ultrasounds can help visualize internal organs and maybe useful in telling the difference between fluid-filledcysts and solid masses. If the tumor is solid, it is mostlikely cancerous.\nBlood tests\nCertain blood tests can be helpful in diagnosing\nsome testicular tumors. Tumor markers are substances\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3257Testicular cancer\nPenis\nSite of\ncancer\nScrotumTesticle\nA cancerous growth on the testicle. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)often found in higher-than-normal amounts in cancer\npatients. Some testicular cancers secrete high levels ofcertain proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), humanchorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and enzymes like lactatedehydrogenase (LDH). These markers may help find atumor that is too small to be felt during a physical exami-nation. In addition, these tests are also helpful in deter-mining how much cancer is actually present, and in eval-uating the response to treatment to make sure the tumorhas not returned.\nSurgery\nIf a suspicious growth is found, a surgeon will need\nto remove the tumor and send it to the laboratory for test-ing. A pathologist examines the testicular tissue micro-scopically to determine whether cancer cells are present.If cancer cells are found, the pathologist sends back areport describing the type and extent of the cancer. Inalmost all cases, the surgeon removes the entire affectedtesticle through an incision in the groin, though notthrough the scrotum. This procedure is called radicalinguinal orchiectomy.\nOnce testicular cancer is determined, further tests\nare necessary to find out if the cancer has metastasized(spread) to other parts of the body, and to ascertain thestage or extent of the disease. This information helps thedoctor plan appropriate treatment. These tests mayinclude computed tomography (CT scan), lymphangiog-\nraphy (x rays of the lymph system), bone scans, and\nchest x rays.\nTreatment\nStaging\nOne method the cancer treatment team uses to\ndescribe the scope of a patient’s cancer is the use of astaging system. Testicular cancer is classified using theTNM system. However, in order to simplify and summa-rize this information, the TNM description can begrouped according to stages.\nStages of testicular cancer:\n• Stage I. This stage refers to a cancer found only in the\ntesticle, with no spread to the lymph nodes or to distantorgans.\n• Stage II. This indicates that the cancer has spread to the\nlymph nodes in the abdomen, but not to lymph nodes inother parts of the body.\n• Stage III. In this stage, the cancer has spread beyond\nthe lymph nodes in the abdomen, and/or the cancer is inparts of the body far away from the testicles, such as thelungs or the liver.• Recurrent. Recurrent disease indicates that the cancer\nhas come back after it has already been treated. Testicu-lar cancer can come back in the same testicle (if it wasnot surgically removed) or in some other body part.\nTreatment\nThe treatment decisions for testicular cancer are\ndependent on the stage and cell type of the disease, aswell as the patient’s age and overall health. The fourkinds of treatment most commonly used are surgery,radiation therapy ,chemotherapy , and bone marrow or\nstem cell transplantation.\nSurgery is normally the first line of treatment for tes-\nticular cancer and involves the removal of the affectedtesticle. This procedure is known as a radical inguinalorchiectomy. Depending on the type and stage of thecancer, some lymph nodes may also be removed at thesame time, or possibly in a second operation. This proce-dure is called a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection,and can be a major operation. Some patients will experi-ence temporary complications after surgery, includinginfections and bowel obstruction. If both of the testiclesare taken out, a man will have no ability to producesperm cells and will become infertile (unable to father achild). Surgery removing the lymph nodes may causesome damage to nearby nerves, which may interfere withthe ability to ejaculate. Men undergoing surgery for tes-ticular cancer may wish to discuss nerve-sparing surgerywith their doctor, as well as sperm banking.\nRadiation therapy for testicular cancer is delivered\nfrom a machine and is known as external beam radiation.One potential problem with this type of radiation is that itcan also destroy nearby healthy tissue as well as cancercells. Other potential side effects include nausea, diar-\nrhea and fatigue . A special device can be used to protect\nthe unaffected testicle to preserve fertility.\nChemotherapy refers to the use of drugs in treating\ncancer. Since the drugs enter the bloodstream and circu-late throughout the body, chemotherapy is considered asystemic treatment. The drugs primarily used in the treat-ment of testicular cancer are cisplatin, vinblastine,bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and ifos-famide. These drugs are given in various combinations,since the use of two or more drugs is considered moreeffective than using only one drug.\nSince chemotherapy agents can affect normal as\nwell as cancerous cells, several side effects are possible.These side effects include:\n•nausea and vomiting\n• changes in appetite• hair loss (temporary)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3258Testicular cancer• mouth sores\n• increased risk of infections• bleeding or bruising• fatigue• diarrhea or constipation\nSeveral drugs are available to assist in treating these\nside effects, most of which will disappear after the treat-ment is completed. However, some of the chemotherapyagents used during treatment of testicular cancer may causelong-term side effects. These include hearing loss , nerve\ndamage, and possible kidney or lung damage. Anotherpotentially serious long-term complication is an increasedrisk of leukemia. This is a rare side effect, however, as itoccurs in less than 1% of testicular cancer patients whoreceive chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may also interferewith sperm production. This may be permanent for some,but many will regain their fertility within a few years.\nStudies are ongoing to determine whether high\ndoses of chemotherapy combined with stem-cell trans-plantation will prove effective in treating some patientswith advanced testicular cancer. In this treatment, blood-forming cells called stem cells are taken from the patient(either from the bone marrow or filtered out of thepatient’s blood). These cells are kept frozen while high-dose chemotherapy is administered. After receiving thechemotherapy, the patient is given the stem cells throughan infusion. This treatment enables the use of extra largedoses of chemotherapy that might increase the cure ratefor some testicular cancers.\nPreferred treatment plans by stage of disease\nStage I: Stage I seminomas are normally treated with\na radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by radiationtreatment aimed at the lymph nodes. More than 95% ofStage I seminomas are cured through this method. Anoth-er approach is to perform surgery only. Patients are thenfollowed closely for several years with blood tests andimaging studies. If the cancer spreads later on, radiationor chemotherapy can still be used. Stage I non-semino-mas are also highly curable with surgery, followed by oneof three options. These options include the performanceof a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, two cycles ofchemotherapy, or careful observation for several years.\nStage II: Stage II seminomas and non-seminomas\nare cured in 90% to 95% of the cases. For the purposes oftreatment, stage II testicular cancers are classified aseither bulky or nonbulky. Nonbulky seminomas (nolymph nodes can be felt in the abdomen) are treated withan orchiectomy followed by radiation to the lymphnodes. Men with bulky seminomas have surgery, whichmay be followed by either radiation or a course ofchemotherapy. Nonbulky Stage II non-seminomas are\ntreated with surgery and lymph node removal, with pos-sible chemotherapy. Men with bulky disease havesurgery followed by chemotherapy.\nStage III: Stage III seminomas and non-seminomas\nare treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Thisproduces a cure in about 70% of the cases. Those whoare not cured may be eligible to participate in clinical tri-als of other chemotherapy agents.\nRecurrent: Treatment of recurrent testicular cancer\nis dependent upon the initial stage and the treatmentgiven. This might include further surgery and chemother-apy. Many men whose disease comes back afterchemotherapy are treated with high-dose chemotherapyfollowed by bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are currently no scientifically proven alterna-\ntive treatments known for testicular cancer. Nothing hasbeen shown to be as successful as conventional treat-ment. However, some patients may find certain alterna-tive or complementary treatments supportive whileundergoing surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. Forexample, meditation and relaxation exercises may prove\neffective in reducing nausea and vomiting. Some dietarymodifications and nutritional supplements may be help-ful in assisting with recovery after surgery. The testicularcancer patient considering alternative treatments shouldtalk it over with members of the cancer care team. Theymay be able to offer additional information.\nPrevention\nThe main risk factors associated with testicular can-\ncer—cryptorchidism, family history of the disease, andbeing Caucasian—are unavoidable since they are presentat birth. In addition, many men diagnosed with the dis-ease have no known risk factors. Because of these rea-sons, it is not possible to prevent most incidences of tes-ticular cancer.\nResources\nBOOKS\nNichols, Craig R., et al. “Neoplasms of the Testis.” In Cancer\nMedicine, 5th ed.

Known also as undescended testi-cles, it is the primary risk factor for testicular cancer.\nMetastatic testicular cancer —Testicular cancer\nthat has spread to other parts of the body.\nRadical inguinal orchiectomy —Surgical proce-\ndure performed to remove one or both testicles. Itis done via a groin incision.\nTesticles —Also called testes or gonads, they are\npart of the male reproductive system, and arelocated beneath the penis in the scrotum.Purpose\nMost testicular cancers are first noticed by the man\nhimself. Men should do a TSE every month to find out ifthe testes contain any suspicious lumps or other irregu-larities, which could be signs of cancer or infection. \nPrecautions\nNone.\nDescription\nA TSE should take place during a warm shower or\nbath, when the skin is warm, wet, and soapy. The manneeds to step out of the tub so that he is in front of a mir-ror. The heat from the tub or shower will relax the scro-tum (sac containing the testes) and the skin will be softerand thinner, making it easier to feel a lump. It is impor-tant that the exam be done very gently.\nThe man should stand facing his mirror and look for\nswelling on the scrotum. Using both hands, the scrotumshould be gently lifted so that the area underneath can bechecked.\nThe next step is the examination by hand. The index\nand middle fingers should be placed under each testicle,with the thumbs on top. The testes should be examinedone at a time. The man should roll each testicle betweenhis fingers and thumbs. He should feel for lumps of anysize (even as small as a pea) particularly on the front orside of each testicle. He should also look for soreness orirregularities. Next, the epididymis and vas deferens,located on the top and back of the testes, should be felt.This area feels like a cord, and should not be tender.\nNormal results\nIt is normal for one testicle to be larger than the\nother is, and for them to hang at different levels; but thesize should stay the same from one month to the next.The testes should be free from lumps, pain , irregularities\nand swelling.\nAbnormal results\nA TSE is considered abnormal if any swelling, ten-\nderness, lumps, or irregularities are found. Hard, unmov-ing lumps are abnormal, even if they are painless. A lumpcould be a sign of an infection or a cancerous tumor. Achange in testicle size from one month to the next is alsoabnormal. A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum is anotherabnormal sign. If any abnormality is found, a man isencouraged to check with his doctor as soon as possiblebecause testicular cancer is highly curable if found early.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3260Testicular self-examinationResources\nBOOKS\nHainsworth, John D., and F.

    "content": "Testicular surgery\nDefinition\nTesticular surgery is any surgical operation on the\ntesticles.\nPurpose\nTesticular surgery is used primarily to correct devel-\nopmental defects, treat infection, and treat cancer of the\ntestes.\nPrecautions\nTesticular surgery, a group of surgical operations\nperformed on the testicles, is considered major surgery.KEY TERMS\nEpididymis —A tube in the back of the testes that\ntransports sperm.\nScrotum —The pouch containing the testes.\nTestes —Egg-shaped male gonads located in the\nscrotum. Testes is the plural form of testis, which isa testicle.\nVas deferens —A tube that is a continuation of the\nepididymis. This tube transports sperm from thetestis to the prostatic urethra.In all cases, except when the testes are being removed,\ncare must be taken not to damage any of the nerves andblood vessels supplying the testes and associated organs.\nDescription\nTesticular surgery is commonly performed for the\nfollowing reasons: to reposition undescended testes\n(orchiopexy); to correct testicular torsion ; to treat tes-\nticular cancer , which may involve removal of the testi-\ncles (castration) or the testes (orchiectomy); and to cor-rect intersex states .\nUndescended testes\nUndescended testes are testes that have not dropped\ninto the scrotum. During the fetal stage of development,the testes are not in the scrotum, but in the body. As malechildren age, the testes descend from the body to the scro-tum for proper maturation and function. Undescendedtestes must be treated with surgery. There are two types ofundescended testes, ectopic and cryptorchid. Ectopictestes are outside the normal route of descent. Cryptorchidtestes are in the proper route of descent, but descent hasbeen stopped before the testes reached the scrotum. Thetreatment for undescended testes is a surgical operationcalled orchiopexy, in which an incision allows the surgeonto reach the testes and pull them down into the scrotum.This operation is best done between the ages of one andtwo; otherwise, the testes are unlikely to mature normally.If the patient has one normal testis and one poorly devel-oped testis, the undeveloped testis is usually removed.\nTesticular torsion\nTesticular torsion is a developmental defect in the\ntissues of the scrotum that allows the testes to rotatewithin the scrotum. This results in the blood vesselsaround other tubes in the scrotum to become wrappedaround each other, resulting in blood supply to the testesbring cut off. Torsion disease is seen in young boys.Pain , nausea, and scrotal swelling are the main symp-\ntoms. When torsion is suspected, immediate surgery isrecommended. An incision is made in the scrotum, andthe blood vessels and other tissues are untangled. Duringsurgery, the testes are examined to determine their condi-tion. If they have received enough blood to remainviable, the testes are surgically attached to scrotal tissueto prevent twisting from recurring. If the testes do notregain a healthy pink color after the blood vessels havebeen untangled, then it is best to remove the testes. Thelack of a pink color indicates that the testes have beenwithout blood for too long a time period, and are deadtissue. Unless removed, they will turn necrotic and causefurther harm to the body. Usually, testicular torsion\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3261Testicular surgeryoccurs in only one testis. However, because the other tes-\nticle has similar anatomy, it too is subject to torsion. Dur-ing surgery, the other testicle is attached to scrotal tissueto prevent torsion from occurring.\nCancer\nCarcinoma of the testes is cancer in the testicles. For\nmales between ages 20–35, carcinoma of the testes is thesecond most common cancer. It accounts for 1–2% of allcancers in all males. There are many kinds of cancer thatcan affect the testes. A mass of tissue that is suspected tobe cancer should be removed surgically. It is recom-mended that a biopsy not be performed, but that thephysician proceed directly to surgery. Biopsies have notproven to be better at diagnosing cancer of the testiclesthan exploratory surgery. If the presence of cancer is con-firmed during exploratory surgery, surgical excision ofthe cancer can be performed immediately.\nThe approach to the cancer during the operation\ndepends on the location of the tissue mass. The two mainapproaches are through the scrotum and through thegroin (inguinal region). The amount of tissue removed isvariable and depends on the amount of cancerous tissueand the location. However, if a solid lesion is confirmedwithin a testis, a radical orchiectomy should be per-formed. A radical orchiectomy is a complete removal ofone or both testes and associated lymphatic tissue. Othertumors allow partial removal of a testis. After surgery,the tumor is examined to determine the type of tumor foruse as a guide in followup therapy.\nCastration is the surgical removal of the testicles.\nCastration is performed as a cancer therapy, to reduce theamount of testosterone being produced, and as part oftreatment for prostate cancer . In castration, an incision is\nmade through one or both sides of the scrotum, dependingon whether one or both testicles are being removed.\nIntersex states\nIntersex states are a group of developmental diseases\nin which the patient has parts of both male and femalegenitalia. In testicular feminization syndrome, the patientappears to be a female and will have female genitalia buthas internal testes. The internal testes are undescended.Genetic studies show that the person was to be a male.This form of intersex is also called male pseudohermaph-roditism. There are a number of different causes of thiscondition. These patients produce the male hormonetestosterone. Treatment consists of surgical removal ofthe internal testes, and the administration of the hormoneestrogen, which produces female characteristics. Failureto remove the testes is associated with a higher rate ofcancer in these patients. KEY TERMS\nBiopsy —Removing tissue to test it for disease.\nLesion —An injury in the body tissue, such as a\nwound, sore, rash, or boil.\nOrchiectomy —Surgical removal of one or both\ntestes.\nOrchiopexy —Surgical fixation of one or both\ntestes.\nTestes —The pair of male reproductive glands\nenclosed in the scrotum that produce the male sexhormone testosterone and the spermatozoa. Thesingular form is testis. \nTesticles —The testes along with their enclosing\nstructures. \nPreparation\nAbout one hour before receiving general anesthesia,\nthe patient will get a shot that dries up internal fluids andmakes him sleepy. Presurgical counseling is often recom-mended for patients whose reproductive abilities will becompromised by their surgeries.\nAftercare\nA patient who has had a testicle removed should\nvisit his physician once a month for the first year andevery other month for the second year, with periodic fol-lowups thereafter.\nRisks\nTesticular surgery, like any major surgery, can have\npostoperative complications. These complicationsinclude internal bleeding and wound infection, as well asadverse reactions to anesthesia.\nNormal results\nUndescended testes are pulled down into their cor-\nrect position and mature normally. In testicular torsion,the affected testis either regains its healthy pink colorand is attached to the surrounding tissue with sutures,or it is removed along with any dead tissue surroundingit. (So long as only one testis is removed, sexual func-tion and fertility will not be affected.)

    "title": "Testicular torsion",
    "content": "Testicular torsion\nDefinition\nTesticular torsion is the twisting of a testis (testicle)\non its connection.\nDescription\nThe testes are suspended in the scrotum by a single\nbundle of tissues that also carries the blood supply to andfrom the testes. If the testicle rotates, the bundle kinks,and the blood supply is shut off. The resulting situation isan emergency because the testis will die within hours ifthe blood supply is not restored.\nCauses and symptoms\nSome testes hang in such a way that they twist more\neasily than others. Nearly all torsions happen to adoles-cent males—between the ages of 12 and 18—becausetheir testes enlarge by a factor of five to six duringpuberty . A larger testis is more likely to twist. Torsion\ncan also occur in a newborn.\nSymptoms of testicular torsion are sudden severe\npain in the scrotum, swelling, nausea and vomiting .\nDiagnosis\nA nuclear scan of the scrotum may be performed. In\nthis procedure, a tiny amount of radioactive fluid isinjected into the blood and detected as it flows throughthe scrotum and testicles. Torsion is indicated if theradioactive fluid does not flow through the sore testis.Ultrasound scan accompanied by a contrast agent canalso be used to diagnose testicular torsion.\nTreatment\nSurgery must be performed within 24 hours to\nensure the health of the affected testis. During the proce-dure, the surgeon untwists the cord and secures the testisin place so that it cannot rotate again. The other testicleshould also be secured to deter future testicular torsion.This procedure is called orchiopexy.\nPrognosis\nIf the torsion is relieved within 24 hours, the testis\nwill recover normal blood flow and function.\nPrevention\nTorsion of the unaffected testis is prevented by\nsecuring it during the surgery to correct the twisted testis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nRajfer, Jacob. “Congenital Anomalies of the Testes and Scro-\ntum.” In Campbell’s Urology , ed.

    "title": "Tetanus",
    "content": "Tetanus\nDefinition\nTetanus is a rare but often fatal disease that affects the\ncentral nervous system by causing painful muscular con-tractions. It begins when tetanus bacteria enter the body,usually through a wound or cut exposed to contaminatedsoil. Tetanus is easily preventable through vaccination .\nDescription\nTetanus is rare in the United States, with nearly all\ncases occurring in adults who were not vaccinated aschildren. About 100 cases are reported each year; 63% ofthese occur in people over the age of 50. The number oftetanus cases in the United States has steadily decreasedsince the 1940s (500 to 600 cases per year); the numberof reported cases has remained at approximately 50 to100 cases per year since the mid-1970s. In 1999, howev-er, the lowest number of annual cases to date was report-ed (33, or 0.02 per 100,000).\nTetanus causes convulsive muscle spasms and rigidity\nthat can lead to respiratory paralysis and death . It is some-\ntimes called “lockjaw” because one of the most commonsymptoms is a stiff jaw, unable to be opened. Sometimes,tetanus affects only the part of the body where the infectionbegan, but in almost all of reported cases, it spreads to theentire body. The incubation period from the time of theinjury until the first symptoms appear ranges from two to50 days. Symptoms usually occur within five to 10 days.When symptoms occur early, the chance of death isincreased. Tetanus is not contagious.\nCauses and symptoms\nTetanus is caused by a bacteria called Clostridium\ntetani, whose spores (the dormant form) are found in soil,street dust, and animal (or even human) feces. Tetanus\nspores germinate in the body, producing a highly poisonousneurotoxin in the blood, spreading to the nervous system.The infection is usually transmitted through deep puncturewounds or cuts or scratches that are not cleaned well.\nBetween 1997 and 1999, approximately 64% of tetanuscases in the United States were associated with suchwounds as punctures, lacerations, or abrasions. Many peo-ple associate tetanus with rusty nails and other dirtyobjects, but any wound can be a source. Less commonways of getting tetanus are animal scratches and bites, sur-gical wounds, dental work, and therapeutic abortion. About18% of cases reported between 1997 and 1999 were aresult of intravenous drug use. Cases have also been report-ed in people with no known wound or medical condition.\nThe first symptom of tetanus is often a stiff or\n“locked” jaw that prevents the patient from openinghis/her mouth or swallowing. This is also called trismusand results in a facial expression called a sardonic smile(or risus sardonicus). Stiffness of the neck and other mus-cles throughout the body and uncontrollable spasms oftenfollow. Sometimes these convulsions are severe enough tocause broken bones. The bacterial toxin ( tetanospasmin )\naffects the nerve endings, causing a continuous stimula-tion of muscles. Other symptoms include irritability, rest-lessness, loss of appetite, and drooling. People withtetanus that is localized experience pain and tingling only\nat the wound site and spasms in nearby muscles.\nIn the underdeveloped world, neonatal tetanus\naccounts for about one-half of tetanus deaths and is relat-ed to infection of the umbilical stump in a baby born ofan unimmunized mother. The Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC) estimate that over 270,000deaths occur annually worldwide as a result of neonataltetanus. In contrast, only two cases of neonatal tetanus inthe United States were reported to the CDC between1989 and 1999. Mothers who have been adequatelyimmunized against tetanus protect their newborns bypassing the antibody through the placenta.\nDiagnosis\nTetanus is diagnosed by the clinical symptoms and a\nmedical history that shows no tetanus immunization.Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial to recovery fromtetanus.\nTreatment\nTetanus is a life-threatening disease that requires\nimmediate hospitalization, usually in an intensive careunit (ICU). Treatment can take several weeks andincludes antibiotics to kill the bacteria and shots of anti-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3264Tetanustoxin to neutralize the toxin. It also includes muscle-\nrelaxing drugs to control muscle spasms or barbiturates\nfor sedation . In severe cases, patients are placed on an\nartificial respirator. Recovery can take six weeks ormore. After recovery, since the levels of circulating toxinare too low to stimulate natural antibody production, thepatient must still be immunized against this disease toprevent reinfection.\nPrognosis\nUp to 30% of tetanus victims in the United States die.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment improves the prognosis.Neonatal tetanus has a mortality rate of more than 90%.\nPrevention\nPre-exposure vaccination\nTetanus is easily preventable through vaccination.\nAll children should have a series of five doses of DTaP, acombined vaccine that offers protection against diphthe-\nria, tetanus, and pertussis, before the age of seven,\naccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion’s national immunization guidelines, the AdvisoryCommittee on Immunization Practices, the Committeeon Infectious Diseases of the American Academy ofPediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physi-cians. Children will not be admitted to school withoutproof of this and other immunizations.\nThe DTaP (diptheria, tetanus, accellular pertussis)\nvaccine should be given at ages two months, fourmonths, six months, 15 to 18 months, and four to sixyears. DTaP is the preferred vaccine for children up tothe age of seven in the United States; it has fewer sideeffects than DTP and can be used to complete a vaccina-tion schedule begun with DTP. DTaP was first approvedby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Septem-ber 1996. In December 1996, it was approved for use ininfants. Between the ages of 11 and 13, children shouldhave a booster for diphtheria and tetanus, called Td.\nAdults should have a Td booster every 10 years. Sta-\ntistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion (CDC) show that fewer than half of Americans 60years of age and older have antibodies against tetanus.The CDC suggests adults may be revaccinated at mid-decade birthdays (for example, 45, 55). Adults who havenever been vaccinated against tetanus should get a seriesof three injections of Td over six to 12 months and thenfollow the 10-year booster shot schedule.\nSide effects of the tetanus vaccine are minor: sore-\nness, redness, or swelling at the site of the injection thatappear anytime from a few hours to two days after thevaccination and go away in a day or two. Rare but seri-\nous side effects that require immediate treatment by adoctor are serious allergic reactions or deep, aching painand muscle wasting in the upper arms. These symptomscould start from two days to four weeks after the shot andcould continue for months.\nIn early 2001, a shortage of the tetanus vaccine\nbecame evident after the pharmaceutical companyWyeth-Ayerst Laboratories decided to stop production ofthe tetanus vaccine, leaving Aventis-Pasteur as the solemanufacturer of the vaccine. As a result, hospitals wereprovided with only a minimal amount of the drug on aweekly basis—enough to vaccinate patients with poten-tially infected wounds and other priority cases. Despitestepped-up production efforts on the part of the manufac-turer, however, a spokesperson for Aventis-Pasteur pre-dicted that the shortage would last until the end of 2001,as the vaccine takes 11 months to produce.\nPost-exposure care\nKeeping wounds and scratches clean is important in\npreventing infection. Since this organism grows only in theabsence of oxygen, wounds must be adequately cleaned ofdead tissue and foreign substances. Run cool water over thewound and wash it with a mild soap. Dry it with a cleancloth or sterile gauze. To help prevent infection, apply anantibiotic cream or ointment and cover the wound with abandage. The longer a wound takes to heal, the greater thechance of infection. If the wound doesn’t heal, or if it is red,warm, drains, or swells, consult a doctor.\nFollowing a wound, to produce rapid levels of circu-\nlating antibody, a doctor may administer a specific antitox-in (human tetanus immune globulin, TIG) if the individual\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3265Tetanus\nOne characteristic of tetanus bacillus is the recurrent con-\ntracture of a muscle. Here, the patient’s left hand is affected.(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)does not have an adequate history of immunization. The\nantitoxin is given at the same sitting as a dose of vaccinebut at separate sites. Some individuals will report a historyof significant allergy to “tetanus shots.” In most cases, thisoccurred in the remote past and was probably due to theprevious use of antitoxin derived from horse serum.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\n“Have You Had Your Shots Yet?” Tufts University Health &\nNutrition Newsletter (August 1997): 4.\nLanders, Susan J. “Tetanus vaccine shortage leads to\nrationing.” American Medical News. <http://www.ama-\nassn.org/sci-pubs/amnews/pick_01/hlsb0319.htm>.

Physicians may prescribe these drugs to treateye infections, pneumonia ,gonorrhea ,Rocky Moun-\ntain spotted fever , urinary tract infections, and other\ninfections caused by bacteria. The medicine is also usedto treat acne . The tetracyclines will notwork for colds,\nflu, and other infections caused by viruses.\nDescription\nTetracyclines are available only with a physician’s\nprescription. They are sold in capsule, tablet, liquid, andinjectable forms. Some commonly used medicines in thisgroup are tetracycline (Achromycin V , Sumycin) anddoxycycline (Doryx, Vibramycin).\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\ntetracycline, its strength, and the type and severity ofinfection for which it is being taken. Check with thephysician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription for the correct dosage. \nTo make sure the infection clears up completely,\ntake the medicine for as long as it has been prescribed.Do not stop taking the drug just because symptoms beginto improve.\nTetracyclines work best when they are at constant\nlevels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take themedicine in doses spaced evenly through the day andnight. Do not miss any doses.\nThis medicine works best when taken on an empty\nstomach, with a full glass of water. The water will helpprevent irritation of the stomach and esophagus (thetube-like structure that runs from the throat to the stom-ach). If the medicine still causes stomach upset, it may benecessary to take it with food. However, tetracyclinesshould never be taken with milk or milk products, as\nthese may prevent the medicine from working properly.Do not drink or eat milk or dairy products within one totwo hours of taking tetracyclines (except doxycyclineand minocycline).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3266TetracyclinesPrecautions\nTaking outdated tetracyclines can cause serious side\neffects. Do not take this medicine if:\n• its color, appearance, or taste have changed• it has been stored in a warm or damp area\n• the expiration date on its label has passed flush any\nsuch medicine down the toilet, if there is any questionabout whether the medicine is still good, check with aphysician or pharmacist\nDo not take antacids , calcium supplements, salicy-\nlates such as Magan or Trilisate, magnesium-containinglaxatives , or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) within\none to two hours of taking tetracyclines.\nDo not take any medicines that contain iron (includ-\ning multivitamin and mineral supplements) within two tothree hours of taking tetracyclines.\nSome people feel dizzy when taking these drugs.\nThe medicine may also cause blurred vision. Because ofthese possible effects, anyone who takes these drugsshould not drive, use machines or do anything else thatmight be dangerous until they have found out how thedrugs affect them.\nBirth control pills may not work properly while\ntetracyclines are being taken. To prevent pregnancy , use\nalternative methods of birth control while taking tetracy-clines.\nThis medicine may increase sensitivity to sunlight.\nEven brief exposure to sun can cause a severe sunburn\nor a rash. While being treated with this medicine, avoidbeing in direct sunlight, especially between 10 \nA.M. and 3\nP.M.; wear a hat and tightly woven clothing that covers\nthe arms and legs; use a sunscreen with a skin protectionfactor (SPF) of at least 15; protect the lips with a sunblock lipstick; and do not use tanning beds, tanningbooths, or sunlamps. The sensitivity to sunlight and sun-lamps may continue for two weeks to several monthsafter stopping the medicine, so continue to be carefulabout sun exposure.\nTetracyclines may permanently discolor the teeth of\npeople who took the medicine in childhood. The drugsmay also slow down the growth of children’s bones. Donot give tetracyclines to infants or children under 8 yearsof age unless directed to do so by the child’s physician.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\ntaking certain other medicines may have problems if theytake tetracyclines. Before taking these drugs, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\nto tetracyclines in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes,\npreservatives, or other substances.\nPREGNANCY. Pregnant women should not take tetra-\ncyclines during the last half of pregnancy. These drugscan prevent the baby’s bones and teeth from developingproperly and can cause the baby’s adult teeth to be per-manently discolored. The medicine can also cause liverproblems in pregnant women.\nBREASTFEEDING. Women who are breastfeeding\nshould not take tetracyclines. The drugs pass into breastmilk and can affect the nursing baby’s teeth and bones.They may also make the baby more sensitive to sunlightand may increase its risk of fungal infections.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using tetra-\ncyclines, people with any of these medical problemsshould make sure their physicians are aware of their con-ditions:\n• diabetes• liver disease• kidney disease\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking tetracyclines\nwith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.\nSide effects\nThe most common side effects are stomach cramps\nor a burning sensation in the stomach, mild diarrhea ,\nnausea, or vomiting. These problems usually go away asthe body adjusts to the drug and do not require medicaltreatment. Less common side effects, such as sore mouthor tongue and itching of the rectal or genital areas also\nmay occur and do not need medical attention unless theydo not go away or they are bothersome.\nOther rare side effects may occur. Anyone who has\nunusual symptoms during or after treatment with tetracy-clines should get in touch with his or her physician.\nInteractions\nTetracyclines may interact with other medicines.\nWhen this happens, the effects of one or both of thedrugs may change or the risk of side effects may begreater. Anyone who takes tetracyclines should let thephysician know all other medicines he or she is taking.Among the drugs that may interact with tetracyclines are:\n• antacids \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3267Tetracyclines• calcium supplements \n• medicines that contain iron (including multivitamin and\nmineral supplements) \n• laxatives that contain magnesium \n• cholesterol-lowering drugs such as cholestyramine\n(Questran) and colestipol (Colestid) \n• salicylates such as Magan and Trilisate \n• penicillins \n• birth control pills\nNancy Ross-Flanigan"

The ventricle on the\nleft side pumps blood full of oxygen through the body;the ventricle on the right side pumps the same bloodthrough the pulmonary artery to the lungs to take up oxy-gen. The left ventricle operates at pressures about fourtimes as high as the right ventricle. Blood is supposed toflow through one side, then the other.\nTetralogy of Fallot is a condition that is character-\nized by several congenital heart defects occurring atonce. They include:KEY TERMS\nGonorrhea —A sexually transmitted disease (STD)\nthat causes infection in the genital organs and maycause disease in other parts of the body.\nMicroorganism —An organism that is too small to\nbe seen with the naked eye.\nRocky Mountain spotted fever —An infectious dis-\nease that is caused by a microorganism and spreadby ticks.

The problem starts veryearly in the uterus with a narrowed pulmonary valve and ahole between the ventricles. This is not particularly aproblem for a fetus because hardly any blood flowsthrough the lungs until birth. It is only after birth that thedefects pose a problem. The blood that is supposed tostart flowing through the lungs cannot easily get therebecause of the narrowed valve; however, the hole betweenthe ventricles remains open. Because of the openingbetween ventricles, much of the blood that comes back tothe heart needing oxygen is sent out without being prop-erly oxygenated. In addition, the right heart has to pumpat the same pressure as the left side. Several changes fol-low. First, the baby turns blue (cyanotic) because of thedeoxygenated blood that bypasses the lungs. Deoxygenat-ed blood is darker and appears blue through the skin. Sec-ond, the right side of the heart (ventricle) hypertrophies(gets more muscular) from the extra exercise demanded\nof it. Next, the low oxygen causes the blood to get thickerand clot more easily. Clots in the veins can now passthrough the hole in the heart and directly enter the aorta,where they can do much more damage than in thelungs—such as causing infarcts in the brain. In addition,these anomalies make the lining of the heart more suscep-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3268Tetralogy of Fallottible to infection—endocarditis— which can damage\nvalves and lead to blood poisoning (septicemia).\nCauses and symptoms\nTetralogy of Fallot is a congenital defect with unknown\ncauses.\nBabies with tetralogy of Fallot are blue at birth\n(cyanosis ). Sometimes the blue color appears only when\nthey cry. They also have detectable heart murmurs . Infants\nwith mild forms can have surgery postponed until they areolder. Infants with more severe symptoms often have attacksof worsened cyanosis. During attacks, they turn very blue,have shortness of breath , and can faint. This usually occurs\nduring heightened activity, such as crying.\nDiagnosis\nA complete evaluation of the circulation is required,\nincluding testing the blood for its oxygen content, ultra-sound and x rays of the heart accompanied by a contrastagent to determine the amount of blood flowing in thewrong direction. A search for other birth defects is also\nnecessary, because they tend to happen together. Treatment\nCorrection of the defects are done through surgery.\nSurgery must be carefully timed with attention to theprogression of the disease process, the size of the infant,and the size of the various defects. There are temporarysurgical procedures that can prolong the time before cor-rective surgery while the baby grows larger and stronger.\nDuring surgery, the pulmonary valve is widened, the\nventricular septal defect is closed, and any interim cor-rections removed.\nPrognosis\nSurgical correction has a high rate of success,\nreturning the child to near-normal health.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFriedman, William F., and John S.

    "title": "Thalassemia",
    "content": "Thalassemia\nDefinition\nThalassemia describes a group of inherited disorders\ncharacterized by reduced or absent amounts of hemoglo-bin, the oxygen-carrying protein inside the red bloodcells. There are two basic groups of thalassemia disor-ders: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. These con-ditions cause varying degrees of anemia, which canrange from insignificant to life threatening. \nDescription\nAll types of thalassemias are considered quantitative\ndiseases of hemoglobin, because the quantity of hemo-globin produced is reduced or absent. Usual adult hemo-globin is made up of three components: alpha globin,beta globin, and heme. Thalassemias are classifiedaccording to the globin that is affected, hence the namesalpha and beta thalassemia. Although both classes of\nthalassemia affect the same protein, the alpha and betathalassemias are distinct diseases that affect the body indifferent ways.\nBeta thalassemia\nBeta thalassemia may be the best-known type of tha-\nlassemia and is also called Cooley’s anemia. It is causedby a change in the gene for the beta globin component ofhemoglobin. Beta thalassemia causes variable anemiathat can range from moderate to severe, depending inpart on the exact genetic change underlying the disease.Beta thalassemia can be classified based on clinicalsymptoms. Beta thalassemia major usually causes severe\nanemia that can occur within months after birth. If leftuntreated, severe anemia can result in insufficient growthand development, as well as other characteristic physicalcomplications that can lead to a dramatically decreasedlife-expectancy. Fortunately, in developed countries betathalassemia is usually identified by screening in the new-born period, before symptoms have developed. Childrenwho are identified early can be started on ongoing bloodtransfusion therapy as needed. Although transfusion\ntherapy prevents many of the complications of severeanemia, the body is unable to eliminate the excess ironcontained in the transfused blood. Over time, this excessiron deposits in tissues and organs, resulting in damageand organ failure. Another medication must be adminis-tered to help the body eliminate the excess iron and pre-vent iron-overload complications. Beta thalassemia\nintermedia describes the disease in individuals who have\nmoderate anemia that only requires blood transfusionsintermittently, if at all.\nAlpha thalassemia\nAlpha thalassemia is the result of changes in the\ngenes for the alpha globin component of hemoglobin.There are two main types of alpha thalassemia disease:hemoglobin H disease and alpha thalassemia major. Thetwo diseases are quite different from beta thalassemia aswell as from one another. Individuals with hemoglobin Hdisease can experience events of hemolytic anemia—anemia caused by the rapid breakdown of the red bloodcells. These events are thought to be triggered by variousenvironmental causes, such as infection and/or exposureto certain chemicals. Hemoglobin H disease is in mostcases milder than beta thalassemia. It does not generallyrequire transfusion therapy. Alpha thalassemia major is a\nvery serious disease that results in severe anemia thatbegins even before birth. Most affected babies do not sur-vive to be born or die shortly after birth.\nThe thalassemias are among the most common genet-\nic diseases worldwide. Both alpha and beta thalassemiahave been described in individuals of almost every ances-try, but the conditions are more common among certainethnic groups. Unaffected carriers of all types of tha-lassemia traits do not experience health problems. In fact,the thalassemia trait is protective against malaria , a dis-\nease caused by blood-borne parasites transmitted throughmosquito bites. According to a widely accepted theory,most genetic changes—mutations—that cause thalassemiaoccurred multiple generations ago. Coincidentally, thesemutations increased the likelihood that carriers would sur-vive malaria infection. Survivors passed the mutation ontotheir offspring, and the trait became established through-out areas where malaria is common. As populationsmigrated, so did the thalassemia traits.\nBeta thalassemia trait is seen most commonly in\npeople with the following ancestry: Mediterranean(including North African, and particularly Italian andGreek), Middle Eastern, Indian, African, Chinese, andSoutheast Asian (including Vietnamese, Laotian, Thai,Singaporean, Filipino, Cambodian, Malaysian, Burmese,and Indonesian). Alpha-thalassemia trait is seen withincreased frequency in the same ethnic groups. However,there are different types of alpha thalassemia traits withinthese populations. The frequency of hemoglobin H dis-ease and alpha thalassemia major depends on the type of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3270Thalassemiaalpha thalassemia trait. The populations in which alpha\nthalassemia diseases are most common include SoutheastAsians and Chinese (particularly Southern Chinese). \nIt is difficult to obtain accurate prevalence figures for\nvarious types of thalassemia within different populations.This difficulty arises due to testing limitations in determin-ing exact genetic diagnoses, as well as the fact that manystudies have focused on small, biased hospital populations.\nTwo studies reflect prevalence figures that can be help-\nful counseling families and determining who to screen forbeta thalassemia. Between the years of 1990 and 1996, theState of California screened over 3.1 million infants born inthis multiethnic state for beta thalassemia. Approximatelyone in 114,000 infants had beta thalassemia major, withprevalence rates being highest among Asian Indians (aboutone in 4,000), Southeast Asians (about one in 10,000), andMiddle Easterners (about one in 7,000). Another type ofbeta thalassemia disease, E/beta thalassemia, was represent-ed in approximately one in 110,000 births, all of whichoccurred in families of Southeast Asian ancestry. AmongSoutheast Asians, the prevalence of E/beta thalassemia wasapproximately one in 2,600 births. This is in keeping withthe observation that hemoglobin E trait carrier rates are rela-tively high within the Southeast Asian population: 16% in astudy of 768 immigrants to California, and up to 25% insome specific Southeast Asian populations such as Cambo-dians. While these California studies address some of thelimitations of earlier population studies, the patternobserved in California is expected to be different in otherareas of the United States and the world. For example, Ital-ians are underrepresented in this population when comparedto the population of the East Coast of the United States.\nDetermining prevalence figures for alpha thalassemia\nis even more difficult due to increased limitations in diag-nostic testing. All types of alpha thalassemia disease aremost common among people of Southeast Asian and Chi-nese descent, for reasons that become clearer with an under-standing of the underlying genetics of alpha thalassemia.One study of 500 pregnant women in Northern Thailandestimated a frequency of one in 500 pregnancies affected byalpha thalassemia major, for example. Prevalence of alphathalassemia disease is significantly lower in the UnitedStates owing primarily to immigration patterns; although atleast one state, California, has observed growing hemoglo-bin H disease incidence rates that are high enough to justifyuniversal newborn screening for the condition.\nCauses\nGenetics\nHumans normally make several types of the oxygen-\ncarrying protein hemoglobin. An individual’s stage indevelopment determines whether he or she makes pri-\nmarily embryonic, fetal, or adult hemoglobins. All typesof hemoglobin are made of three components: heme,alpha (or alpha-like) globin, and beta (or beta-like) glo-bin. All types of thalassemia are caused by changes ineither the alpha- or beta-globin gene. These changescause little or no globin to be produced. The thalassemiasare, therefore, considered quantitative hemoglobin dis-\neases. All types of thalassemias are recessively inherited,meaning that a genetic change must be inherited fromboth the mother and the father. The severity of the dis-ease is influenced by the exact thalassemia mutationsinherited, as well as other genetic and environmental fac-tors. There are rare exceptions, notably with beta tha-lassemia, where globin gene mutations exhibit a domi-nant pattern of inheritance in which only one gene needsto be altered in order to see disease expression.\nBETA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have two nor-\nmal copies of the beta globin gene, which is located onchromosome 11 and makes the beta globin component ofnormal adult hemoglobin, hemoglobin A. There areapproximately 100 genetic mutations that have beendescribed that cause beta thalassemia, designated aseither beta0 or beta+ mutations. No beta globin is pro-duced with a beta0 mutation, and only a small fraction ofthe normal amount of beta globin is produced with abeta+ mutation.\nWhen an individual has one normal beta globin gene\nand one with a beta thalassemia mutation, he or she issaid to carry the beta thalassemia trait. Beta thalassemiatrait, like other hemoglobin traits, is protective againstmalaria infection. Trait status is generally thought not tocause health problems, although some women with betathalassemia trait may have an increased tendency towardanemia during pregnancy .\nWhen two members of a couple carry the beta tha-\nlassemia trait, there is a 25% chance that each of theirchildren will inherit beta thalassemia disease by inherit-ing two beta thalassemia mutations, one from each par-ent. The clinical severity of the beta thalassemia dis-ease—whether an individual has beta thalassemia inter-media or beta thalassemia major—will depend largely onwhether the mutations inherited are beta0 thalassemia orbeta+ thalassemia mutations. Two beta0 mutations gen-erally lead to beta thalassemia major, and two beta+ tha-lassemia mutations generally lead to beta thalassemiaintermedia. Inheritance of one beta0 and one beta+ tha-lassemia mutation tends to be less predictable.\nAlthough relatively uncommon, there are other tha-\nlassemia-like mutations that can affect the beta globingene. Hemoglobin E is the result of a substitution of asingle nucleotide. This change results in a structurally\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3271Thalassemiaaltered hemoglobin that is produced in decreased\namounts. Therefore, hemoglobin E is unique in that it isboth a quantitative (i.e. thalassemia-like) and qualitativetrait. When co-inherited with a beta thalassemia trait, itcauses a disease that is almost indistinguishable frombeta thalassemia disease. Large deletions around andincluding the beta globin gene can lead to delta/beta tha-lassemia or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin(HPFH). Interestingly, delta/beta thalassemia traitbehaves very similar to beta thalassemia trait in its clini-cal manisfestations. However, HPFH trait does not tendto cause hemoglobin disease when co-inherited with asecond thalassemia or other beta globin mutation.\nALPHA-THALASSEMIA. Most individuals have four\nnormal copies of the alpha globin gene, two copies oneach chromosome 16. These genes make the alpha globincomponent of normal adult hemoglobin, which is calledhemoglobin A. Alpha globin is also a component of fetalhemoglobin and the other major adult hemoglobin calledhemoglobin A2. Mutations of the alpha globin genes areusually deletions of the gene, resulting in absent produc-tion of alpha globin. Since there are four genes (insteadof the usual two) to consider when looking at alpha glo-bin gene inheritance, there are several alpha globin typesthat are possible.\nAbsence of one alpha globin gene leads to a condi-\ntion known as silent alpha thalassemia trait. This condi-tion causes no health problems and can be detected onlyby special genetic testing . Alpha thalassemia trait occurs\nwhen two alpha globin genes are missing. This can occurin two ways. The genes may be deleted from the samechromosome, causing the ‘cis’ type of alpha thalassemiatrait. Alternately, they may be deleted from differentchromosomes, causing the ‘trans’ type of alpha tha-lassemia trait. In both instances, there are no associatedhealth problems, although the trait status may be detect-ed by more routine blood screening.\nHemoglobin H disease results from the deletion of\nthree alpha globin genes, such that there is only onefunctioning gene. Typically, this can occur when one par-ent carries the silent alpha thalassemia trait, and the otherparent carries the ‘cis’ type of the alpha thalassemia trait.In this situation, there is a 25% chance for hemoglobin Hdisease in each of such a couple’s children.\nHemoglobin H disease-like symptoms can also be a\npart of a unique condition called alpha thalassemia men-\ntal retardation syndrome . Alpha thalassemia mental\nretardation syndrome can be caused by a deletion of a\nsignificant amount of chromosome 16, affecting thealpha globin genes. This is usually not inherited, butrather occurs sporadically in the affected individual.Affected individuals have mild hemoglobin H disease,mild-to-moderate mental retardation, and characteristic\nfacial features. This syndrome can also occur as a sex-linked form in which a mutation is inherited in a particu-lar gene on the X-chromosome. This gene influencesalpha globin production, as well as various other devel-opmental processes. Individuals affected with this formof the syndrome tend to have more severe mental retarda-tion, delayed development, nearly absent speech, charac-teristic facial features, and genital-urinary abnormalities.The remaining discussion will focus only on aspects ofhemoglobin H disease.\nAlpha thalassemia major results from the deletion of\nall four alpha globin genes, such that there are no func-tioning alpha globin genes. This can occur when bothparents carry the ‘cis’ type of the alpha thalassemia trait.In this situation, there is a 25% chance for alpha tha-lassemia major in each of such a couple’s children.\nSymptoms\nBeta thalassemia\nBeta thalassemia major is characterized by severe\nanemia that can begin months after birth. In the UnitedStates and other developed countries beta thalassemia isidentified and treated early and effectively. Therefore, thefollowing discussion of symptoms applies primarily toaffected individuals in the past and unfortunately in someunderdeveloped countries now. If untreated, beta tha-lassemia major can lead to severe lethargy, paleness, andgrowth and developmental delay. The body attempts tocompensate by producing more blood, which is madeinside the bones in the marrow. However, this is ineffec-tive without the needed genetic instructions to makeenough functioning hemoglobin. Instead, obvious boneexpansion and changes occur that cause characteristicfacial and other changes in appearance, as well asincreased risk of fractures . Severe anemia taxes other\norgans in the body—such as the heart, spleen, andliver—which must work harder than usual. This can leadto heart failure , as well as enlargement and other prob-\nlems of the liver and spleen. When untreated, beta tha-lassemia major generally results in childhood death,\nusually due to heart failure. Fortunately, in developedcountries diagnosis is usually made early, often beforesymptoms have begun. This allows for treatment withblood transfusion therapy, which can prevent most of thecomplications of the severe anemia caused by beta tha-lassemia major. Individuals with beta thalassemia inter-media have a more moderate anemia that may onlyrequire treatment with transfusion intermittently, such aswhen infections occur and stress the body. As a personwith beta thalassemia intermedia gets older, however, theneed for blood transfusions may increase to the point that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3272ThalassemiaKEY TERMS\nAnemia —A blood condition in which the level of\nhemoglobin or the number of red blood cells fallsbelow normal values. Common symptoms includepaleness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.\nBilirubin —A yellow pigment that is the end result of\nhemoglobin breakdown. This pigment is metabo-lized in the liver and excreted from the bodythrough the bile. Bloodstream levels are normallylow; however, extensive red cell destruction leadsto excessive bilirubin formation and jaundice.\nBone marrow —A spongy tissue located in the hol-\nlow centers of certain bones, such as the skull andhip bones. Bone marrow is the site of blood cellgeneration.\nBone marrow transplantation —A medical proce-\ndure used to treat some diseases that arise fromdefective blood cell formation in the bone marrow.Healthy bone marrow is extracted from a donor toreplace the marrow in an ailing individual. Proteinson the surface of bone marrow cells must be identi-cal or very closely matched between a donor andthe recipient.\nDesferoxamine —The primary drug used in iron\nchelation therapy. It aids in counteracting the life-threatening buildup of iron in the body associatedwith long-term blood transfusions.\nGlobin —One of the component protein molecules\nfound in hemoglobin. Normal adult hemoglobinhas a pair each of alpha-globin and beta-globinmolecules.\nHeme —The iron-containing molecule in hemoglo-\nbin that serves as the site for oxygen binding.\nHemoglobin —Protein-iron compound in the blood\nthat carries oxygen to the cells and carries carbondioxide away from the cells.\nHemoglobin A —Normal adult hemoglobin that\ncontains a heme molecule, two alpha-globin mole-cules, and two beta-globin molecules.Hemoglobin electrophoresis —A laboratory test that\nseparates molecules based on their size, shape, orelectrical charge.\nHepatomegaly —An abnormally large liver.\nHLA type —Refers to the unique set of proteins\ncalled human leukocyte antigens. These proteinsare present on each individual’s cell and allow theimmune system to recognize ‘self’ from ‘foreign’.HLA type is particularly important in organ and tis-sue transplantation.\nHydroxyurea —A drug that has been shown to\ninduce production of fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemo-globin has a pair of gamma-globin molecules inplace of the typical beta-globins of adult hemoglo-bin. Higher-than-normal levels of fetal hemoglobincan ameliorate some of the symptoms of thalassemia.\nIron overload —A side effect of frequent blood\ntransfusions in which the body accumulates abnor-mally high levels of iron. Iron deposits can form inorgans, particularly the heart, and cause life-threat-ening damage.\nJaundice —Yellowing of the skin or eyes due to\nexcess of bilirubin in the blood.\nMutation —A permanent change in the genetic\nmaterial that may alter a trait or characteristic of anindividual, or manifest as disease, and can be trans-mitted to offspring.\nPlacenta —The organ responsible for oxygen and\nnutrition exchange between a pregnant mother andher developing baby.\nRed blood cell —Hemoglobin-containing blood\ncells that transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues.In the tissues, the red blood cells exchange theiroxygen for carbon dioxide, which is brought backto the lungs to be exhaled.\nScreening —Process through which carriers of a trait\nmay be identified within a population.\nSplenomegaly —Enlargement of the spleen.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3273Thalassemiathey are required on a regular basis. When this occurs\ntheir disease becomes more similar to beta thalassemiamajor. Other genetic and environmental factors can influ-ence the course of the disease as well. For example, co-inheritance of one or two alpha thalassemia mutationscan tend to ameliorate some of the symptoms of beta tha-lassemia disease, which result in part from an imbalancein the amount of alpha- and beta-globin present in the redblood cells. \nHemoglobin H disease\nAbsence of three alpha globin genes causes an\nimbalance of alpha and beta globin proteins in the redblood cells. The excess beta globin proteins tend to cometogether to form hemoglobin H, which is unable torelease oxygen to the tissues. In addition, hemoglobin Htends to precipitate out in the cells, causing damage tothe red blood cell membrane. When affected individualsare exposed to certain drugs and chemicals known tomake the membrane more fragile, the cells are thought tobecome vulnerable to breakdown in large numbers, acomplication called hemolytic anemia . Fever and infec-\ntion are also considered to be triggers of hemolytic ane-mia in hemoglobin H disease. This can result in fatigue ,\npaleness, and a yellow discoloration of the skin andwhites of eyes called jaundice . Usually, the anemia is\nmild enough not to require treatment. Severe anemiaevents may require blood transfusion, however, and areusually accompanied by such other symptoms as darkfeces or urine and abdominal or back pain . These events\nare uncommon in hemoglobin H disease, although theyoccur more frequently in a more serious type of hemo-globin H disease called hemoglobin H/Constant Springdisease. Individuals effected with this type of hemoglo-bin H disease are also more likely to have enlargement ofand other problems with the spleen.\nAlpha thalassemia major\nBecause alpha globin is a necessary component of all\nmajor hemoglobins and some minor hemoglobins,absence of all functioning alpha globin genes leads to seri-ous medical consequences that begin even before birth.Affected fetuses develop severe anemia as early as the firsttrimester of pregnancy. The placenta, heart, liver, spleen,and adrenal glands may all become enlarged. Fluid canbegin collecting throughout the body as early as the startof the second trimester, causing damage to developing tis-sues and organs. Growth retardation is also common.Affected fetuses usually miscarry or die shortly after birth.In addition, women carrying affected fetuses are atincreased risk of developing complications of pregnancyand delivery. Up to 80% of such women develop toxemia,a disturbance of metabolism that can potentially lead toconvulsions and coma . Other maternal complications\ninclude premature delivery and increased rates of deliveryby cesarean section , as well as hemorrhage after delivery.\nDiagnosis\nThalassemia may be suspected if an individual\nshows signs that are suggestive of the disease. In allcases, however, laboratory diagnosis is essential to con-firm the exact diagnosis and to allow for the provision ofaccurate genetic counseling about recurrence risks and\ntesting options for parents and affected individuals.Screening is likewise recommended to determine traitstatus for individuals of high-risk ethnic groups.\nThe following tests are used to screen for tha-\nlassemia disease and/or trait:\n• complete blood count\n•hemoglobin electrophoresis with quantitative hemo-\nglobin A2 and hemoglobin F\n• free erythrocyte-protoporphyrin (or ferritin or other\nstudies of serum iron levels)\nA complete blood count will identify low levels of\nhemoglobin, small red blood cells, and other red bloodcell abnormalities that are characteristic of a thalassemiadiagnosis. Since thalassemia trait can sometimes be diffi-cult to distinguish from iron deficiency, tests to evaluateiron levels are important. A hemoglobin electrophoresis is\na test that can help identify the types and quantities ofhemoglobin made by an individual. This test uses an elec-tric field applied across a slab of gel-like material. Hemo-globins migrate through this gel at various rates and tospecific locations, depending on their size, shape, andelectrical charge. Isoelectric focusing and high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography (HPLC) use similar princi-\nples to separate hemoglobins and can be used instead ofor in various combinations with hemoglobin elec-trophoresis to determine the types and quantities of hemo-globin present. Hemoglobin electrophoresis results areusually within the normal range for all types of alpha tha-lassemia. However, hemoglobin A2 levels and sometimeshemoglobin F levels are elevated when beta thalassemiadisease or trait is present. Hemoglobin electrophoresiscan also detect structurally abnormal hemoglobins thatmay be co-inherited with a thalassemia trait to cause tha-lassemia disease (i.e., hemoglobin E) or other types ofhemoglobin disease (i.e., sickle hemoglobin). SometimesDNA testing is needed in addition to the above screeningtests. This can be performed to help confirm the diagnosisand establish the exact genetic type of thalassemia. \nDiagnosis of thalassemia can occur under various cir-\ncumstances and at various ages. Several states offer tha-lassemia screening as part of the usual battery of blood\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3274Thalassemiatests done for newborns. This allows for early identifica-\ntion and treatment. Thalassemia can be identified beforebirth through the use of prenatal diagnosis. Chorionic vil-\nlus sampling (CVS) can be offered as early as 10 weeks\nof pregnancy and involves removing a sample of the pla-centa made by the baby and testing the cells. CVS carriesa risk of causing a miscarriage that is between 0.5%–1%.\nAmniocentesis is generally offered between 15 and 22\nweeks of pregnancy, but can sometimes be offered earlier.Two to three tablespoons of the fluid surrounding the babyis removed. This fluid contains fetal cells that can be test-ed. The risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesisranges from 0.33–0.5%. Pregnant woman and couplesmay choose prenatal testing in order to prepare for thebirth of a baby that may have thalassemia. Alternately,knowing the diagnosis during pregnancy allows for theoption of pregnancy termination. Preimplantation geneticdiagnosis (PGD) is a relatively new technique thatinvolves in-vitro fertilization followed by genetic testingof one cell from each developing embryo. Only theembryos unaffected by sickle cell disease are transferred\nback into the uterus. PGD is currently available on aresearch basis only and is relatively expensive.\nTreatment\nBeta Thalassemia\nIndividuals with beta thalassemia major receive reg-\nular blood transfusions, usually on a monthly basis. Thishelps prevent severe anemia and allow for more normalgrowth and development. Transfusion therapy does havelimitations, however. Individuals can develop reactionsto certain proteins in the blood—called a transfusionreaction. This can make locating appropriately matcheddonor blood more difficult. Although blood supplies inthe United States are very safe, particularly relative to thepast and to other areas of the world, there remains anincreased risk of exposure to such blood-borne infectionsas hepatitis. Additionally, the body is not able to get ridof the excess iron that accompanies each transfusion. Anadditional medication called desferoxamine is adminis-tered, usually five nights per week over a period of sever-al hours, using an automatic pump that can be used dur-ing sleep or taken anywhere the person goes. This med-ication is able to bind to the excess iron, which can thenbe eliminated through urine. If desferoxamine is not usedregularly or is unavailable, iron overload can develop andcause tissue damage and organ damage and failure. Theheart, liver, and endocrine organs are particularly vulner-able. Desferoxamine itself may rarely produce allergic ortoxic side effects, including hearing damage. Signs ofdesferoxamine toxicity are screened for and generallydevelop in individuals who overuse the medication whenbody iron levels are sufficiently low. Overall, however,transfusion and desferoxamine therapy have increased\nthe life expectancy of individuals with the most severetypes of beta thalassemia major to the 4th or 5th decade.This can be expected to improve with time and increaseddevelopments in treatment, as well as for those withmore mild forms of the disease.\nNew treatments offer additional options for some\nindividuals with beta thalassemia major. There are variousmedications that target the production of red blood cells(i.e. erythropoeitin) or fetal hemoglobin (i.e. hydroxyureaand butyrate). Their effectiveness in ameliorating theseverity of beta thalassemia is currently being investigat-ed. Another promising new treatment is bone marrow\ntransplantation , in which the bone marrow of an affect-\ned individual is replaced with the bone marrow of anunaffected donor. If successful, this treatment can providea cure. However, there is an approximately 10-15%chance the procedure could be unsuccessful (i.e. the tha-lassemia returns); result in complications (i.e. graft-ver-sus-host disease); or result in death. The risk for specificindividuals depends on current health status, age, andother factors. Because of the risks involved and the factthat beta thalassemia is a treatable condition, transplantphysicians require a brother or sister donor who has anidentically matched tissue type, called HLA type. HLAtype refers to the unique set of proteins present on eachindividual’s cells, which allows the immune system torecognize “self” from “foreign.” HLA type is geneticallydetermined, so there is a 25% chance for two siblings tobe a match. Transplant physicians and researchers arealso investigating ways to improve the safety and effec-tiveness of bone marrow transplantation. Using newbornsibling umbilical cord blood—the blood from the placen-ta that is otherwise discarded after birth but contains cellsthat can go on to make bone marrow—seems to provide asafer and perhaps more effective source of donor cells.Donors and recipients may not have to be perfect HLAmatches for a successful transplant using cord blood cells.Trials are also underway to determine the effectiveness of“partial transplants,” in which a safer transplant procedureis used to replace only a percentage of the affected indi-vidual’s bone marrow. Other possible treatments on thehorizon may include gene therapy techniques aimed at\nincreasing the amount of normal hemoglobin the body isable to make.\nHemoglobin H disease\nHemoglobin H disease is a relatively mild form of\nthalassemia that may go unrecognized. It is not generallyconsidered a condition that will reduce one’s lifeexpectancy. Education is an important part of managingthe health of an individual with hemoglobin H disease. Itis important to be able to recognize the signs of severe\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3275Thalassemiaanemia that require medical attention. It is also important\nto be aware of the medications, chemicals, and otherexposures to avoid due to the theoretical risk they pose ofcausing a severe anemia event. When severe anemiaoccurs, it is treated with blood transfusion therapy. Forindividuals with hemoglobin H disease, this is rarelyrequired. For those with the hemoglobin H/ConstantSpring form of the disease, the need for transfusions maybe intermittent or ongoing, perhaps on a monthly basisand requiring desferoxamine treatment. Individuals withthis more severe form of the disease may also have anincreased chance of requiring removal of an enlargedand/or overactive spleen. \nAlpha thalassemia major\nBecause alpha thalassemia major is most often a con-\ndition that is fatal in the prenatal or newborn period, treat-ment has previously been focused on identifying affectedpregnancies in order to provide appropriate managementto reduce potential maternal complications. Pregnancytermination provides one form of management. Increasedprenatal surveillance and early treatment of maternalcomplications is an approach that is appropriate for moth-ers who wish to continue their pregnancy with the knowl-edge that the baby will most likely not survive. In recentyears, there have been a handful of infants with this con-dition who have survived long-term. Most of these infantsreceived experimental treatment including transfusionsbefore birth, early delivery, and even bone marrow trans-plantation before birth, although the latter procedure hasnot yet been successful. For those infants that survive todelivery, there seems to be an increased risk of develop-mental problems and physical effects, particularly heartand genital malformations. Otherwise, their medical out-look is similar to a child with beta thalassemia major,with the important exception that ongoing, lifelong bloodtransfusions begin right at birth.\nPrognosis\nAs discussed above, the prognosis for individuals\nwith the most serious types of thalassemia has improveddrastically in the last several years following recent med-ical advances in transfusion, chemo-, and transplantationtherapy. Advances continue and promise to improve thelife expectancy and quality of life further for affectedindividuals.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCohen, A., et. al.

    "title": "Thallium heart scan",
    "content": "Thallium heart scan\nDefinition\nA thallium heart scan is a test using a special camera\nand a small amount of radioactive substance injected intothe bloodstream to make an image of the blood flow tothe heart.\nPurpose\nA thallium heart scan is used to evaluate the blood\nsupply to the heart muscle. It can identify areas of theheart that may have a poor blood supply as a result ofdamage from a previous heart attack or blocked coro-\nnary arteries. While exercise testing has long been a\nstandard examination in the diagnosis of coronary\nartery disease , in some cases, the thallium scan may be\nmore sensitive and more specific in the information itprovides. In other words, the test may be better able todetect a problem and to differentiate one condition fromanother. A thallium heart scan may more accuratelydetect ischemic heart disease. This type of scan is mostlikely to be helpful in cases in which the exercise test isinconclusive, the patient cannot exercise adequately, or aquantitative evaluation of blood flow is required. In addi-tion to evaluating coronary artery disease, thallium scan-ning can help to evaluate blood flow following treatmentof clogged arteries with coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery or angioplasty .\nPrecautions\nRadioisotopes such as thallium 201 should not be\nadministered during pregnancy because they may be\nharmful to the fetus.\nDescription\nThe thallium scan is performed in conjunction with\nan exercise stress test . At the end of the stress test (once\nthe patient has reached the highest level of exercise he orshe can comfortably achieve), a small amount of theharmless radioisotope thallium 201 is injected into thepatient’s bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) line.The patient then lies down under a special camera calleda gamma scintillation camera, which makes photographsfrom the gamma rays emitted by the thallium.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3277Thallium heart scan\nA thallium scan showing many images of a human heart\nwith cold spots. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\npermission.)The thallium attaches itself to the red blood cells\nand is carried throughout the body in the bloodstream. Itenters the heart muscle by way of the coronary arteriesand collects in the cells of the heart muscle that comeinto contact with the blood. Since the thallium can reachonly those areas of the heart with an adequate blood sup-ply, no thallium will show up in poorly perfused areas ofthe heart (perfusion defects). These areas show up as“cold spots” on the thallium scan. The patient may thenbe given a second injection of thallium. Several hourslater, the gamma scintillation camera takes more pic-tures in order to get an image of the heart when thepatient is at rest.\nCold spots that appear at rest as well as during\nexercise often indicate areas where the heart tissue hasbeen damaged (for example, as a result of a prior heartattack). Sometimes perfusion is adequate during restbut cold spots appear during exercise, when the hearthas to work harder and has a greater demand for blood.This can indicate some blockage in the coronary arter-ies, producing a condition called ischemia . In\nischemia, the heart temporarily does not get enoughblood flow. People with perfusion defects, especiallyperfusion defects that appear only during exercise,have the greatest risk of such future cardiac events asheart attacks.\nIn recent years, there have been improvements in\nheart scanning. Many centers now use a single photonemission computed tomographic (SPECT) camera,which provides a clearer image. Some centers also use atype of radioactive chemical called sestamibi. Sestamibiis used along with a radioactive compound called tech-netium. While thallium may still be better for some uses,such as providing a better image of the heart muscleitself, sestamibi may produce clearer images in over-weight patients and is more useful in assessing how wellthe heart pumps blood.\nIf the patient is unable to exercise because of another\nmedical condition, such as arthritis, he or she may begiven a drug to mimic the effects of exercise on the heart.Some of these drugs include dipyridamole (Persantine),which dilates the coronary arteries; and dobutamine,which increases blood flow through the heart muscle.\nPreparation\nPatients should not drink alcoholic or caffeinated\nbeverages, smoke tobacco, or ingest other nicotine prod-ucts for 24 hours before the test. These substances canaffect test results. Patients should also not eat anythingfor at least three hours before the test.

    "title": "Thematic apperception test",
    "content": "Thematic apperception test\nDefinition\nThe thematic apperception test (TAT) is a projective\npersonality test that was designed at Harvard in the1930s by Christiana D. Morgan and Henry A. Murray.Along with the MMPI and the Rorschach, the TAT is oneof the most widely used psychological tests . A projec-\ntive test is one in which a person’s patterns of thought,attitudes, observational capacity, and emotional respons-es are evaluated on the basis of responses to ambiguoustest materials. The TAT consists of 31 pictures that depicta variety of social and interpersonal situations.The sub-ject is asked to tell a story about each picture to theexaminer. Of the 31 pictures, 10 are gender-specificwhile 21 others can be used with adults of either sex andwith children. As of 2001, the TAT is distributed by Har-court Brace Educational Measurement.\nPurpose\nThe original purpose of the TAT was to reveal the\nunderlying dynamics of the subject’s personality, such asinternal conflicts, dominant drives and interests, motives,etc. The specific motives that the TAT assesses includethe need for achievement, need for power, the need forintimacy, and problem-solving abilities. After World WarKEY TERMS\nApperception —The process of understanding\nthrough linkage with previous experience.\nHuman potential movement —A movement in\npsychotherapy that began in the 1960s andemphasized maximizing the potential of each par-ticipant through such techniques as group therapyand sensitivity training.\nProjective test —A type of psychological test that\nassesses a person’s thinking patterns, observationalability, feelings, and attitudes on the basis ofresponses to ambiguous test materials. It is notintended to diagnose psychiatric disorders.\nII, however, the TAT was used by psychoanalysts and\nclinicians from other schools of thought to evaluate emo-tionally disturbed patients. Another shift took place inthe 1970s, when the influence of the human potentialmovement led many psychologists to emphasize the use-fulness of the TAT in assessment services—that is, usingthe test to help clients understand themselves better andstimulate their personal growth.\nThe TAT is widely used to research certain topics in\npsychology, such as dreams and fantasies, mate selec-tion, the factors that motivate people’s choice of occupa-tions, and similar subjects. It is sometimes used in psy-chiatric evaluations to assess disordered thinking and inforensic examinations to evaluate crime suspects, eventhough it is not a diagnostic test. As mentioned earlier,the TAT can be used to help people understand their ownpersonality in greater depth and build on that knowledgein making important life decisions. Lastly, it is some-times used as a screener in psychological evaluations ofcandidates for high-stress occupations (law enforcement,the military, religious ministry, etc.).\nPrecautions\nThe TAT has been criticized for its lack of a stan-\ndardized method of administration as well as the lack ofstandard norms for interpretation. Studies of the interac-tions between examiners and test subjects have foundthat the race, sex, and social class of both participantsinfluence both the stories that are told and the way thestories are interpreted by the examiner. Attempts havebeen made to design sets of TAT cards for African Amer-ican and for elderly test subjects, but the results have notbeen encouraging. In addition, the 31 standard pictureshave been criticized for being too gloomy or depressing,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3279Thematic apperception testand therefore limiting the range of personality character-\nistics that the test can assess.\nDescription\nThere is no standardized procedure or set of cards for\nadministering the TAT, except that it is a one-on-one test.It cannot be administered to groups. In one commonmethod of administration, the examiner shows the subjectonly 10 of the 31 cards at each of two sessions. The ses-sions are not timed, but average about an hour in length.\nPreparation\nThere is no specific preparation necessary before\ntaking the TAT, although most examiners prefer to sched-ule sessions (if there is more than one) over two days.\nRisks\nThe chief risks involved in taking the TAT are a bad\n“fit” between the examiner and the test subject, and mis-use of the results.\nNormal results\nSince the TAT is used primarily for personality\nassessment rather than diagnosis of mental disorders, itdoes not yield a “score” in the usual sense.\nResources\nBOOKS\nArbisi, Paul A. “The Senior Apperception Technique.” In The\nThirteenth Mental Measurements Yearbook ,e d .

In TT, the practitioner alters the patient’s\nenergy field through an energy transfer that moves fromthe hands of the practitioner to the patient.\nOrigins\nTherapeutic touch was developed in 1972 by Dora\nKunz, a psychic healer, and Dolores Krieger, P H.D., R.N,\na nurse and professor of nursing at New York University.The year before, in 1971, when Krieger was working as aregistered nurse in a hospital, she became very frustratedwhen one of her patients, a 30-year-old female, lay dyingfrom a gallbladder condition. In desperation, she triedwhat she was learning from Kunz. Within one treatment,the patient’s condition began to shift and she lived, sur-prising the other hospital staff. Krieger and Kunz metduring the study of Oskar Estebany, a world-renownedhealer. They had invited Estebany to form a study forthree years, observing his work with patients. In thisstudy, Estebany practiced laying-on of hands healing onvarious patients. Using her psychic and intuitive abilities,Kunz would observe and assist in the healing, whileKrieger recorded the activities of the healing session andcreated profiles of the patients.\nAs the study progressed, Kunz began teaching\nKrieger how to heal, based on her perceptions of Este-bany’s healing techniques. During her research of ancienthealing methods, Krieger concluded that the energy trans-fer between the healer and the healee that takes place in aTT session is prana , an Eastern Indian concept represent-\ning energy, vitality, and vigor. Krieger then combined herresearch with Kunz’s techniques to create TT.\nTT was initially developed for persons in the health\nprofessions, but is currently taught worldwide to anyonewho is interested in learning the technique. As of 1998, anestimated 100,000 people around the world have beentrained in TT; 43,000 of those persons are health care pro-fessionals, many of whom use TT in conjunction with tra-ditional medicine, as well as osteopathic, chiropractic ,\nnaturopathic, and homeopathic therapies. TT is taught inover 100 colleges, universities, and medical schools.\nBenefits\nThe major effects of TT are relaxation, pain reduc-\ntion, accelerated healing, and alleviation of psychoso-matic symptoms. Studies have shown that TT has a bene-ficial effect on the blood as it has the ability to raisehemoglobin values. It also affects brain waves to inducea relaxed state. TT can induce the relaxation responseoften within five minutes.\nKrieger has said that it is not individual illnesses that\nvalidate the effectiveness of TT, but rather, it is ques-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3281Therapeutic touchtioned which systems are most sensitive to TT. She and\nothers have found that the most sensitive is the autonomicnervous system (ANS), which, for example, controls uri-nation. The ANS is followed by dysfunctions of lymphat-ic and circulatory systems, and then finally musculoskele-tal systems. In addition, the female endocrine system ismore sensitive to TT than the corresponding male system.Thus, TT helps with dysmenorrhea ,amenorrhea , prob-\nlems with contraception , and the course of pregnancy .\nTT is reported to have a positive effect on the\nimmune system and thus accelerates the healing ofwounds . Nurses use therapeutic touch in operating\nrooms to relax patients before surgery and in recoveryrooms on postoperative patients to help speed the healingprocess. TT is used in the treatment of terminally illpatients, such as those with cancer and autoimmune\ndeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ), to relieve anxiety and\nstress , create peace of mind, and reduce pain.\nMany nurses use TT in the nursery. The conditions\nof many premature babies who received TT reportedlyimproved rapidly. TT has been used to calm colickyinfants, assist women in childbirth , and increase milk\nlet-down in breast-feeding mothers.\nOther claims of TT include relief of acute pain, nau-\nsea, diarrhea , tension and migraine headaches, fever ,\nand joint and tissue swelling. TT has been used to treatthyroid imbalances, ulcers, psychosomatic illnesses, pre-\nmenstrual syndrome ,Alzheimer’s disease ,stroke and\ncoma ,multiple sclerosis ,measles , infections, asthma ,\nand bone and muscle injuries.\nTherapeutic touch is performed in many different\nlocations, including healing centers, delivery rooms, hospi-tals, hospice settings, accident scenes, homes, and schools.\nDescription\nTherapeutic touch treats the whole person: relaxes\nthe mind, heals the body, and soothes the spirit. The prin-ciple behind it is that it does not stop at the skin. Thehuman body extends an energy field, or aura, severalinches to several feet from the body. When illness occurs,it creates a disturbance or blockage in the vital energyfield. The TT practitioner uses her/his hands to sense theblockage or disturbance. In a series of gentle strokes, thehealer removes the disturbance and rebalances the energyto restore health.\nThe TT session generally lasts about 20–30 minutes.\nAlthough the name is therapeutic touch, there is general-ly no touching of the physical body, only the energeticbody or field. It is usually performed on fully clothedpatients who are either lying down on a flat surface orsitting up in a chair.Each session consists of five steps. Before the ses-\nsion begins, the practitioner enters a state of quiet medi-\ntation in which he/she becomes centered and grounded\nin order to establish intent for the healing session and togarner the compassion necessary to heal.\nThe second step involves the assessment of the per-\nson’s vital energy field. During this step, the practitionerplaces the palms of his/her hands 2–3 in (5–8 cm) fromthe patient’s body and sweeps them over the energy fieldin slow, gentle strokes beginning at the head and movingtoward the feet. The practitioner might feel heat, cool-ness, heaviness, pressure, or a prickly or tingling sensa-tion. These cues, as they are called, each signal a block-age or disturbance in the field.\nTo remove these blockages and restore balance to\nthe body, the practitioner then performs a series ofdownward sweeping movements to clear away any ener-gy congestion and smooth the energy field. This isknown as the unruffling process and is generally per-formed from head to feet. To prevent any energy fromclinging to him/her, the practitioner shakes his/her handsafter each stroke.\nDuring the next phase, the practitioner acts as a con-\nduit to transfer energy to the patient. The energy used isnot solely the energy of the practitioner. The practitionerrelies on a universal source of energy so as not to depletehis/her own supply. In short, the healer acts as an energysupport system until the patient’s immune system is ableto take over.\nThe practitioner then smoothes the field to balance\nthe energy and create a symmetrical flow. When the ses-sion is over, it is recommended that the patient relax for10–15 minutes in order for the energies to stabilize.\nSide effects\nThe side effects reported occur when an excess of\nenergy enters the body for an extended period of timecreating restlessness, irritability, and hostility, or increas-ing anxiety and pain. Burns are sensitive to therapeutic\ntouch, and it is recommended that TT be performed onburned tissue for short periods, generally two to threeminutes at a time.\nResearch and general acceptance\nTherapeutic touch is not generally accepted by\nWestern medical professionals. Basic and anecdotalresearch has been performed on TT since its develop-ment in 1972, although little quantitative research hasbeen carried out. It is based on a theory derived from for-mal research. It began as the basis of Dolores Krieger’spostdoctoral research.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3282Therapeutic touchDolores Krieger has performed extensive research\non TT, including with pregnant women, and has notedthat the following changes occur in a patient after short,consistent treatment: relaxation within the first five min-utes of a session, a reduction of pain, and the accelerationof the healing process.\nOne study was created to determine the effect TT\nwould have on wounds that resulted from a biopsy of theupper arm. Forty-four patients placed their injured armsthrough a hole in a door. Twenty-two of them receivedTT on their arms. The other half received no treatment.The wounds treated with TT healed more quickly thanthe wounds that received no treatment.\nIn 1998, a study was performed on 27 patients with\nosteoarthritis in at least one knee. For six weeks, the\npatients were treated with therapeutic touch, mock thera-peutic touch, or standard care. According to The Journal\nof Family Practice , the journal who published the study,\nthe results showed that the group who had received TThad “significantly decreased pain and improved functionas compared with both the placebo and control groups.”\nTherapeutic touch can be combined with a number\nof different therapies, including acupressure , massage,\nmental imagery, physical therapy, and yoga . When com-\nbined with massage and physiotherapy, TT may reducetension headaches, back pain, stress-related problems,circulatory problems, and constipation . Shiatsu and TT\nmay help sinusitis , digestive disorders, muscle cramps,DOLORES KRIEGER (1935– )\nDolores Krieger, a prominent professor of nursing at\nthe New York University Division of Nursing, conceivedof therapeutic touch as a healing technique in the early1970s and introduced the therapy in 1972. Therapeutictouch rarely consists of physical contact with the patient.The practitioner focuses positive energy through thehands, which are held or waved two to three inches awayfrom the patient, and directs it towards the patient’s ener-gy field. Krieger developed the technique along with acolleague, Dora Van Gelder Kunz, who is believed to beclairvoyant. They initially taught the system to graduatestudents at the nursing school, and it evolved from thatbasis. Since the introduction of therapeutic touch, Kriegertraveled the world in teaching the technique before sheretired as professor emerita at the university. An estimated70,000 nurses were trained by Krieger and Kunz.\nIn 1981 Dr. Krieger published Foundations for Holistic\nHealth Nursing Practices . She later published a manual,\nThe Therapeutic Touch: How to Use Your Hands to Help or toHeal, in 1992.Krieger became embroiled in controversy over the\npotential benefits of therapeutic touch techniquebetween 1996-98, when nine-year-old schoolgirl EmilyRosa challenged the validity of the therapy with a sim-ple experiment. She gathered 21 practitioners andthrough a covered box held her hand over one of thepractitioner’s own to test whether they could sense herenergy field. Only 44% of the time were the practition-ers able to determine which of their hands that Rosa’swas hovering over. Although Rosa contacted Krieger in1997, Krieger refused to meet with her, refused to par-ticipate in Rosa’s experiment, and disputed the relevan-cy of an elementary school student’s observations.Krieger holds both an R.N. and a Ph.D. degree and dis-missed the validity of the experiment due to the stu-dent’s and practitioners’ lack of experience.\nKrieger continues to promote her technique; her lat-\nest book, Living the Therapeutic Touch , was published by\nin 1999.\nmenstrual difficulties, and insomnia . Yoga and TT may\nbe beneficial in the treatment of bronchitis , asthma,\nblood pressure, fatigue , and anxiety.\nTT is practiced in over 70 countries worldwide: by\nEgyptians and Israelis during fighting in the Gaza Strip;in South Africa to reduce racial strife; and in Poland,Thailand, and the former Soviet Union.\nTraining and certification\nTherapeutic touch is taught at over 100 universities\nand nursing and medical schools around the UnitedStates and Canada. Although it was developed primarilyfor nurses, anyone can learn TT.\nState laws vary regarding the practice of TT. In gen-\neral, laypersons are allowed to practice TT within theirfamilies. Therapeutic touch is considered an extension ofhealth care skills, so most health care professionals arecovered under the state medical practice act. \nMany hospitals have established policies allowing\nnurses and staff to perform TT on patients at no extracharge. The American Nurse’s Association often holdsworkshops on TT at national conventions.

    "title": "Thoracentesis",
    "content": "Thoracentesis\nDefinition\nAlso known as pleural fluid analysis, thoracentesis\nis a procedure that removes fluid or air from the chestthrough a needle or tube.\nPurpose\nThe lungs are lined on the outside with two thin lay-\ners of tissue called pleura. The space between these twolayers is called the pleural space. Normally, there is onlya small amount of lubricating fluid in this space. Liquidand/or air accumulates in this space between the lungsand the ribs from many conditions. The liquid is called apleural effusion ; the air is called a pneumothorax .\nMost pleural effusions are complications emanatingfrom metastatic malignancy (movement of cancer cells\nfrom one part of the body to another). Most malignantpleural effusions are detected and controlled by thora-centesis. Thoracentesis is also performed as a diagnosticmeasure. In these cases, only small amounts of materialneed to be withdrawn.Symptoms of a pleural effusion include breathing dif-\nficulty, chest pain,fever , weight loss, cough , and edema .\nRemoval of air is often an emergency procedure to preventsuffocation from pressure on the lungs. Negative air pres-sure within the chest cavity allows normal respiration. Theaccumulation of air or fluid within the pleural space caneliminate these normal conditions and disrupt breathingand the movement of air within the chest cavity. Fluidremoval is performed to reduce the pressure in the pleuralspace and to analyze the liquid. In addition, thoracentesiswas traditionally used to remove blood from the chest cav-ity. This is rare now that the placement of a thoracostomytube has proven to be a more effective and safer method.\nThoracentesis often provides immediate abatement\nof symptoms. However, fluid often begins to reaccumu-late. A majority of patients will ultimately require addi-tional therapy beyond a simple thoracentesis.\nThere are two types of liquid in the pleural space,\none having more protein in it than the other. More wateryliquids are called transudates; thicker fluids are calledexudates. On the basis of this difference, the cause of theeffusion can more easily be determined.\nTransudates\nThin, watery fluid oozes into the chest either\nbecause back pressure from circulation squeezes it out orbecause the blood has lost some of its osmotic pressure.\n• Heart failure creates back pressure in the veins as blood\nmust wait to be pumped through the heart. \n•A  pulmonary embolism is a blood clot in the lung. It\nwill create back pressure in the blood flow and alsodamage a part of the lung so that it leaks fluid. \n• Cirrhosis is a sick, scarred liver that both fails to make\nenough protein for the blood and also restricts the flowof blood through it. \n• Nephrosis is a collection of kidney disorders that\nchange the osmotic pressure of blood and allow liquidto seep into body cavities. \n• Myxedema is a disease caused by too little thyroid hor-\nmone.\nExudates\nThicker, more viscous fluid is usually due to greater\ndamage to tissues, allowing blood proteins as well aswater to seep out.\n• Pneumonia, caused by viruses and by bacteria, dam-\nages lung tissue and can open the way for exudates toenter the pleural space. \n• Tuberculosis can infect the pleura as well as the lungs\nand cause them to leak liquid. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3284Thoracentesis• Cancers of many types settle in the lungs or the pleura\nand leak liquids from their surface. \n• Depending upon its size and the amount of damage it\nhas done, a pulmonary embolism can also produce an\nexudate. \n• Several drugs can damage the lung linings as an unexpect-\ned side effect. None of these drugs is commonly used. \n• An esophagus perforated by cancer, trauma, or other\nconditions can spill liquids and even food into the chest.The irritation creates an exudate in the pleural space. \n• Pancreatic disease can cause massive fluid in the\nabdomen, which can then find its way into the chest. \n• Pericarditis is an inflammation of the sac that contains\nthe heart. It can ooze fluid from both sides—into theheart’s space and into the chest. \n• Radiation to treat cancer or from accidents with radioac-\ntive materials can damage the pleura and lead to exudates. \n• A wide variety of autoimmune diseases attacks the\npleura. Among these are rheumatoid arthritis and sys-\ntemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). \n• Many other rare conditions can also lead to exudates.\nBlood\nBlood in the chest (hemothorax) is infrequently seen\noutside of two conditions:\n• major trauma can sever blood vessels in the chest, caus-\ning them to bleed into the pleural space\n• cancers can ooze blood as well as fluid. They do not\nusually bleed massively\nChyle\nOccasionally, the liquid that comes out of the chest is\nneither transparent nor bloody, but milky. This is due to atear of the large lymphatic channel—the thoracic duct car-rying lymph fluid from the intestines to the heart. It ismilky because it is transporting fats absorbed in theprocess of digestion. The major causes of chylothorax are:\n• injury from major trauma, such as an automobile acci-\ndent\n• cancers eroding into the thoracic duct\nAir\nAir in the pleural space is called pneumothorax. Air\ncan enter the pleural space either directly through a holebetween the ribs or from a hole in the lungs. Holes in thelungs are sometimes spontaneous, sometimes traumatic,and sometimes the result of disease opening a communi-cation to the air in the lung.Precautions\nCare must be taken not to puncture the lung when\ninserting the needle. Thoracentesis should never be per-formed by inserting the needle through an area with aninfection. An alternative site needs to be found in thesecases. Patients who are on anticoagulant drugs should becarefully considered for the procedure.\nDescription\nThe usual place to tap the chest is below the armpit\n(axilla). Under sterile conditions and local anesthesia, aneedle, a through-the-needle-catheter, or an over-the-needle catheter may be used to perform the procedure.Overall, the catheter techniques may be safer. Fluid or airis withdrawn. Fluid is sent to the laboratory for analysis.If the air or fluid continue to accumulate, a tube is left inplace and attached to a one-way system so that it candrain without sucking air into the chest.\nPreparation\nThe location of the fluid is pinpointed through x ray\nor ultrasound. Ultrasound is a more accurate methodwhen the effusion is small. A sedative may be adminis-tered in some cases but is generally not recommended.Oxygen should be given to the patient.\nAftercare\nAs long as the tube is in the chest, the patient must lie\nstill. After it is removed, x rays will determine if the effu-sion or air is reaccumulating—though some researchersand clinicians believe chest x rays do not need to be per-formed after routine thoracentesis. \nRisks\nReaccumulation of fluid or air is a possible compli-\ncations, as are hypovolemic shock (shock caused by a\nlack of circulating blood) and infection. Patients are atincreased risk for poor outcomes if they have a recenthistory of anticoagulant use, have very small effusions,have significant amounts of fluid, have poor health lead-ing into this condition, have positive airway pressure,and have adhesions in the pleural space. A pneumothoraxcan sometimes be caused by the thoracentesis procedure.The use of ultrasound to guide the procedure can reducethe risk of pneumothorax.\nThoracentesis can also result in hemothorax, or\nbleeding within the thorax. In addition, such internalstructures, as the diaphragm, spleen, or liver, can be dam-aged by needle insertion.

It forces a balanc-ing of water in proportion to the amount of dis-solved chemicals in two compartments separatedby a semi-permeable membrane.\nPleura —Two thin layers lining the lungs on the out-\nside.Description\nThe thoracic outlet is an area at the top of the rib\ncage, between the neck and the chest. Several anatomicalstructures pass through this area, including the esopha-gus, trachea, and nerves and blood vessels that lead to thearm and neck region. The area contains the first rib; col-lar bone (clavicle); the arteries beneath the collar bone(subclavian artery), which supply blood to the arms, anetwork of nerves leading to the arms (brachial plexus);and the top of the lungs.\nPain and other symptoms occur when the nerves or\nblood vessels in this area are compressed. The likelihoodof blood vessels or nerves in the thoracic outlet beingcompressed increases with increased size of body tissuesin this area or with decreased size of the thoracic outlet.The pain of thoracic outlet syndrome is sometimes con-fused with the pain of angina that indicates heart prob-\nlems. The two conditions can be distinguished from eachother because the pain of thoracic outlet syndrome doesnot appear or increase when walking, while the pain ofangina does. Also, the pain of thoracic outlet syndromeusually increases if the affected arm is raised, which doesnot happen in cases of angina.\nThere are three types of thoracic outlet syndromes:\n• True neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is caused by\na compression of the nerves in the brachial plexus.Abnormal muscle or other tissue causes the problem. \n• Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome is caused by compression\nof the major artery leading to the arm, usually by a rib. \n• Disputed thoracic outlet syndrome describes patients\nwho have chronic pain in the shoulders and arms andhave no other disease or syndrome, but the underlyingcause cannot be accurately determined.\nThoracic outlet syndrome is most common in women\nwho are 35–55 years of age.\nCauses and symptoms\nCompression of blood vessels or nerves in the tho-\nracic outlet causes pain and/or abnormal nerve sensa-tions. Compression usually occurs at the location wherethe blood vessels and nerves pass out of the thoracic out-let into the arm.\nThere are several factors that contribute to a person\ndeveloping thoracic outlet syndrome. Poor posture is amajor cause and is easy to treat. A person’s physicalmakeup also can cause thoracic outlet syndrome. Forexample, abnormalities of certain anatomical structurescan put pressure on blood vessels or nerves. Typicalabnormalities that can cause problems are malformed\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3286Thoracic outlet syndromeribs and too narrow an opening between the collar bone\nand the first rib.\nThe main symptom is pain in the affected area. The\npatient can also develop weakness in the arm and hands,tingling nerve sensations, and a condition called Ray-naud’s syndrome. In Raynaud’s syndrome, exposure tocold causes small arteries in the fingers to contract, cut-ting off blood flow. This causes the fingers to turn pale.In very severe cases of blood vessel compression, gan-\ngrene can result. Gangrene is the death of tissue caused\nby the blood supply being completely cut off.\nIn the case of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome, the\nartery beneath the collar bone leading to the arm is com-pressed, causing the artery to increase in size. Bloodclots (thrombi) may form in the blood vessel. Whenblood vessels are compressed, the hands, arms, andshoulders do not receive proper blood supply. They canswell and turn blue from a lack of blood.\nIn the case of true neurogenic thoracic outlet syn-\ndrome, the nerves most affected are those of the networkof nerves supplying the chest, shoulder, arm, forearm,and hand (brachial plexus). When a nerve is affected inthoracic outlet syndrome it produces a tingling sensation(paresthesia). It can also cause weakness in the hand andreduced sensation in the palm and fingers.\nDiagnosis\nThere are no specific diagnostic tests for thoracic\noutlet syndromes. The diagnosis is made by ruling outother diseases and by observing the patient. Two nonspe-cific tests that can suggest the presence of thoracic outletsyndrome are the Adsons test and the Allen test. In theAdson test, the patient takes a deep breath and tilts his orher head back and turns it to one side. The physician teststo see if the strength of the patient’s pulse is reduced inthe wrist on the arm on the opposite side of the head turn.In the Allen test, the arm in which the patient is experi-encing symptoms is raised and rotated while the head isturned to the opposite side. The physician tests to see ifthe pulse strength at the wrist is reduced. If the strength ofthe pulse is reduced in either of these two tests it indicatescompression of the subclavian artery.\nOccasionally, examination with a stethoscope may\nreveal abnormal sounds in affected blood vessels. X rayscan reveal constrictions in blood vessels if a special dyeis injected into the blood stream to make the blood ves-sels visible ( angiography ).\nCertain tests are available to help with the diagnosis\nof nerve compression. These include the nerve conductionvelocity test and somatosensory evoked potential test. Inthe nerve conduction velocity test, electrodes are placed atvarious locations on the skin along a nerve that is being\ntested. A mild electrical impulse is delivered through anelectrode at one end of the nerve and the electrical activityis recorded by the other electrodes. The time it takes forthe electrical impulse to travel down the nerve from thestimulating electrodes to the recording electrodes is usedto calculate the nerve conduction velocity. This can beused to determine if any nerve damage exists.\nIn a somatosensory evoked potential test, electrodes\nare placed on the skin at the scalp, neck, shoulder, andwrist. A mild electrical impulse is delivered at the wrist,and a recording is made of the response by the brain andspinal cord. This test also can determine the presence ofnerve damage.\nTreatment\nThe main treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome is\nphysical therapy. Exercises aimed at improving the pos-ture of the affected person are also useful. In some cases,surgery can be performed to remove the cervical rib ifthis is causing the problem and physical therapy hasfailed to work. However, surgery is generally not used totreat thoracic outlet syndrome.\nPrognosis\nTreatment of true neurogenic and arterial thoracic\noutlet syndromes is usually successful. Treatment of dis-puted thoracic outlet syndrome is often unsuccessful.This may relate to the uncertainty of the underlyingcause of the pain.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

    "title": "Thoracic surgery",
    "content": "Thoracic surgery\nDefinition\nThoracic surgery is the repair of organs located in\nthe thorax, or chest. The thoracic cavity lies between the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3287Thoracic outlet syndromeneck and the diaphragm, and contains the heart and lungs\n(cardiopulmonary system), the esophagus, trachea, pleu-ra, mediastinum, chest wall, and diaphragm.\nPurpose\nThoracic surgery repairs diseased or injured organs\nand tissues in the thoracic cavity. General thoracicsurgery deals specifically with disorders of the lungs andesophagus. Cardiothoracic surgery also encompasses dis-orders of the heart and pericardium. Blunt chest trauma,reflux esophagitis, esophageal cancer ,lung transplan-\ntation , lung cancer , and emphysema are just a few of\nthe many clinical indications for thoracic surgery.\nPrecautions\nPatients who have blood-clotting problems (coagu-\nlopathies), and who have had previous standard thoracicsurgery may not be good candidates for video-assistedthoracic surgery (V ATS). Because V ATS requires the col-lapse of one lung, potential patients should have ade-quate respiratory function to maintain oxygenation dur-ing the procedure.\nDescription\nThoracic surgery is usually performed by a surgeon\nwho specializes in either general thoracic surgery or car-diothoracic surgery. The patient is placed under generalanesthesia and endotracheally intubated for the procedure.The procedure followed varies according to the purpose ofthe surgery. An incision that opens the chest (thoracotomy)is frequently performed to give the surgeon access to thethoracic cavity. Commonly, the incision is made beginningon the back under the shoulder blade and extends in acurved arc under the arm to the front of the chest. The mus-cles are cut, and the ribs are spread with a retractor. Thesurgeon may also choose to open the chest through an inci-sion down the breastbone, or sternum (sternotomy).

A lung is collapsed and 3-4 small incisions,or access ports, are made to facilitate insertion of the tho-racoscope and the surgical instruments. During the proce-dure, the surgeon views the inside of the pleural space ona video monitor. The thoracoscope may be extracted andinserted through a different incision site as needed. Whenthe surgical procedure is complete, the surgeon expandsthe lung and inserts a chest tube in one of the incisionsites. The remaining incisions are sealed with adhesive.\nThe thoracic surgeon may also use a mediastino-\nscope or a bronchoscope to explore the thoracic cavity.Mediastinoscopy allows visualization of the medi-\nastinum, the cavity located between the lungs. The bron-choscope enables the surgeon to view the larynx, trachea,and bronchi. These instruments may be used in a sepa-rate diagnostic procedure prior to thoracic surgery, orduring the surgery itself.\nPreparation\nExcept in the case of emergency procedures, candi-\ndates for general thoracic surgery should undergo a com-plete medical history and thorough physical examina-\ntion prior to surgery. Particular attention is given to the\nrespiratory system. The patient’s smoking history will be\nquestioned. If the patient is an active smoker, encourage-ment is always given for the patient to quit smoking priorto the surgery to facilitate recovery and reduce chancesof complications.\nDiagnostic tests used to evaluate the patient preoper-\natively may include, but are not limited to, X-rays, MRI,CT scans, blood gas analysis , pulmonary function tests,\nelectrocardiography , endoscopy, pulmonary angiogra-\nphy, and sputum culture .\nCandidates for thoracic surgery should be fully edu-\ncated by their physician or surgeon on what their surgerywill involve, the possible risks and complications, andrequirements for postoperative care.\nPatients are instructed not to eat 10 to 12 hours prior\nto a thoracic surgery procedure. A sedative may be pro-vided to relax the patient prior to surgery. An intravenousline (IV) is inserted into the patient’s arm or neck toadminister fluids and/or medication.\nAftercare\nAfter surgery, the patient is taken to the recovery\nroom, where vital signs are monitored; depending on\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3288Thoracic surgerythe procedure performed, the breathing tube may be\nremoved. The patient typically experiences moderateto severe pain following surgery. Analgesics or other\npain medication are administered to keep the patientcomfortable. Chest tubes are monitored closely forsigns of fluid or air accumulation in the lungs that canlead to lung collapse. A urinary catheter will remain inthe patient for 24 to 48 hours to drain urine from thebladder.\nThe hospital stay for thoracic surgery depends on\nthe specific procedure performed. Patients who undergoa thoracotomy may be hospitalized a week or longer,while patients undergoing V ATS typically have a shorterhospital stay of 2-3 days. During the recovery period,respiratory therapists and nurses work with the patienton deep breathing and coughing exercises to improvelung function.\nRisks\nRespiratory failure , hemorrhage, nerve injury,\nheart attack ,stroke ,embolism , and infection are all\npossible complications of general thoracic surgery.

    "content": "Thoracoscopy\nDefinition\nThoracoscopy is the insertion of an endoscope, a\nnarrow-diameter tube with a viewing mirror or cameraattachment, through a very small incision (cut) in thechest wall.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3289Thoracic surgeryThoracoscopy is a procedure in which a physician can view\nthe chest cavity and the lungs by inserting an endoscopethrough the chest wall.Thoracoscopy is less invasive thansurgical lung biopsy. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Purpose\nThoracoscopy makes it possible for a physician to\nexamine the lungs or other structures in the chest cavity,without making a large incision. It is an alternative tothoracotomy (opening the chest cavity with a large inci-sion). Many surgical procedures, especially taking tissuesamples (biopsies), can also be accomplished with thora-coscopy. The procedure is done to:\n• assess lung cancer\n• take a biopsy for study\n• determine the cause of fluid in the chest cavity• introduce medications or other treatments directly into\nthe lungs\n• treat accumulated fluid, pus ( empyema ), or blood in\nthe space around the lungs\nFor many patients, thoracoscopy replaces thoracoto-\nmy. It avoids many of the complications of open chestsurgery and reduces pain, hospital stay, and recovery time.\nPrecautions\nBecause one lung is partially deflated during thora-\ncoscopy, the procedure cannot be done on patients whoselung function is so poor that they do not receive enoughoxygen with only one lung. Patients who have had previ-ous surgery that involved the chest cavity, or who havebloodclotting problems, are not good candidates for thisprocedure.\nThoracoscopy gives physicians a good but limited\nview of the organs, such as lungs, in the chest cavity.Endoscope technology is being refined every day, as iswhat physicians can accomplish by inserting scopes andinstruments through several small incisions instead ofmaking one large cut.\nDescription\nThoracoscopy is most commonly performed in a\nhospital, and general anesthesia is used. Some of the pro-cedures are moving toward outpatient services and localanesthesia. More specific names are sometimes appliedto the procedure, depending on what the target site of theeffort is. For example, if a physician intends to examinethe lungs, the procedure is often called pleuroscopy. Theprocedure takes two to four hours.\nThe surgeon makes two or three small incisions in\nthe chest wall, often between the ribs. By making theincisions between the ribs, the surgeon minimizes dam-age to muscle and nerves and the ribs themselves. A tubeis inserted in the trachea and connected to a ventilator,which is a mechanical device that assists the patient withinhaling and exhaling.The most common reason for a thoracoscopy is to\nexamine a lung that has a tumor or a metastatic growth ofcancer. The lung to be examined is deflated to create a spacebetween the chest wall and the lung. The patient breatheswith the other lung with the assistance of the ventilator.\nA specialized endoscope, or narrow-diameter tube,\nwith a video camera or mirrored attachment, is insertedthrough the chest wall. Instruments for taking necessarytissue samples are inserted through other small incisions.After tissue samples are taken, the lung is reinflated. Allincisions except one are closed. The remaining open inci-sion is used to insert a drainage tube. The tissue samplesare sent to a laboratory for evaluation.\nPreparation\nPrior to thoracoscopy, the patient will have several rou-\ntine tests, such as blood, urine and chest x ray . Older\npatients must have an electrocardiogram (a trace record ofthe heart activity) because the anesthesia and the lung defla-tion put a big load on the heart muscle. The patient shouldnot eat or drink from midnight the night before the thora-coscopy. The anesthesia used can cause vomiting, and,because anesthesia also causes the loss of the gag reflex, aperson who vomits is in danger of moving food into thelungs, which can cause serious complications and death .\nAftercare\nAfter the procedure, a chest tube will remain in one\nof the incisions for several days to drain fluid and releaseresidual air from the chest cavity. Hospital stays rangefrom two to five days. Medications for pain are given as\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3290Thoracoscopyneeded. After returning home, patients should do only\nlight lifting for several weeks.\nRisks\nThe main risks of thoracoscopy are those associated\nwith the administration of general anesthesia. Sometimesexcessive bleeding, or hemorrhage, occurs, necessitatinga thoracotomy to stop it. Another risk comes when thedrainage tube is removed, and the patient is vulnerable tolung collapse ( pneumothorax ).\nResources\nBOOKS\nAtkinson, Lucy Jo, and Nancymarie Fortunato.

In untreated patients, the\ndisease has a high rate of reinfection caused by wormsalready present in the body. This type of disease recur-rence is called autoinfection. Because of autoinfection,threadworms can remain inside humans for as long as 45years after the initial infestation.\nDescription\nThreadworm infection, which is also called strongy-\nloidiasis, occurs in most countries of the world but is naturalto (endemic in) tropical and subtropical climates. Strongy-loidiasis is less common than other parasitic infections butmay affect as much as 25% of the population in some devel-oping countries. In the United States, threadworm infectionis most likely to be found among immigrants; returningtravelers or military personnel; people who live in parts ofAppalachia and the southeastern states; and persons inhomes for the retarded and similar institutions.\nHuman beings are universally susceptible to thread-\nworm infection, although adults and older children are atgreater risk of infection than younger children. The dis-ease does not confer immunity. In addition to humans,threadworms can infect dogs, cats, horses, pigs, rats, andmonkeys.\nCauses and symptoms\nThreadworm infection is caused by Strongyloides\nstercoralis , a roundworm that lives in soil and can sur-\nvive there for several generations. Mature threadwormsmay grow as long as 1–2 in (2.5–5 cm). The larvae havetwo stages in their life cycle: a rod-shaped (rhabdoid)first stage, which is not infective; and a threadlike (filari-form) stage, in which the larvae can penetrate intacthuman skin and internal tissues.\nThe infection is most commonly transmitted when a\nperson comes into contact—usually by walking bare-foot—with soil containing S. stercoralis larvae in their\nfilariform stage. The threadlike larvae penetrate the skin,enter the lymphatic system, and are carried by the bloodto the lungs. Once in the lungs, the larvae burst out of thecapillaries into the patient’s main respiratory system.They migrate upwards—usually without symptoms—tothe patient’s throat, where they are swallowed and car-ried down into the digestive tract. The filariform larvaesettle in the small intestine. They mature into adults thatdeposit eggs that hatch—usually in the intestines— intononinfectious rhabdoid larvae. The rhabdoid larvae thenmigrate into the patient’s large intestine and are excretedin the feces. The time from initial penetration of the skinto excretion is 17–28 days. The rhabdoid larvae meta-morphose into the infective filariform stage in the soil.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3291Threadworm infectionThreadworms are unique among human parasites in\nhaving both free-living and parasitic forms. In the free-living life cycle, some rhabdoid larvae develop into adultworms that live in contaminated soil and produce eggsthat hatch into new rhabdoid larvae. The adult wormsmay live as long as five years. \nThe signs and symptoms of threadworm infection\nvary according to the stage of the disease as the larvaemigrate throughout the body. Patients who suffer fromautoinfection may have chronic or intermittent symp-toms for years after they are first infected.\nSkin\nThe filariform larvae usually enter the body through\nthe skin of the feet. There may be swelling, itching , and\nhives at the point of entry that may be confused with insect\nbites. Patients with chronic threadworm infection may alsodevelop an itchy rash on their buttocks, thighs, or abdomen. \nDigestive tract\nAlthough some patients may notice only mild diar-\nrhea and cramps, others may have fever , nausea, vomit-\ning, general weakness, and blood or mucus in theirstools. The pain may mimic a stomach ulcer.\nThroat and lungs\nWhen the larvae migrate to the lungs and air pas-\nsages, the patient may have symptoms ranging from asimple dry cough to fever, difficulty breathing, and\ncoughing up blood or pus.\nHyperinfection syndrome\nHyperinfection syndrome is a potentially fatal set of\ncomplications resulting from the spread of filariform lar-vae to the lungs and other organ systems. It can includeinflammation of the heart tissue, stomach ulcers, perfora-tion of the intestines, blood poisoning ,meningitis ,\nshock , and eventual death . Hyperinfection syndrome is\nmost likely to occur in patients with immune disorders ormalnutrition , or in those taking anti-inflammatory corti-\ncosteroid (anti-inflammatory) medications. It has beenreported in only a few AIDS patients.\nAutoinfection\nThreadworm autoinfection in humans follows two\npatterns. In internal autoinfection, some rhabdoid larvaein the lower bowel develop into filariform larvae thatenter the bloodstream from the intestines and migrate tothe lungs. In external autoinfection, the skin around thepatient’s anus is infected by larvae in the feces.Diagnosis\nThe doctor is likely to consider a diagnosis of\nthreadworm infection when a patient has the symptomsdescribed earlier and a history of travel or military ser-vice in areas where the disease is endemic. A definitediagnosis is made by finding rhabdoid or filariform lar-vae in the patient’s body fluids. The larvae may be foundin fresh stool specimens or in mucus coughed up whenthe infection has reached the lungs. Because the larvaecannot be detected in the stools of 25% of infectedpatients, the string test is often performed to confirm thediagnosis. In this test, the patient swallows a weightedstring which is withdrawn after four hours. The digestivejuices absorbed by the string are then examined for thepresence of threadworm larvae.\nDoctors can also use blood tests and diagnostic\nimaging to support the diagnosis. Between 85% and 95%of patients with threadworm infections will have a mea-surable level of antibodies in their blood, even thoughthese antibodies do not prevent the disease from spread-ing. In addition, patients with severe infections oftenhave unusually high levels of white cells in their blood.X rays of the intestines or the chest often help in locatingspecific areas of inflamed or ulcerated tissue.\nTreatment\nThreadworm infections are treated with medica-\ntions. The drugs most often given are ivermectin, thi-abendazole (Mintezol), and albendazole. Ivermectin isgenerally preferred because it has fewer side effects thanthiabendazole. These drugs, which are taken by mouthover a period of two to seven days, work by preventingthe development of eggs and new larvae. Patients withsevere infections should be given protein replacement,blood transfusions, and fluids to replace losses from nau-sea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nPatients who are taking corticosteroids should be\ncarefully evaluated if they have symptoms of thread-worm infection, because these medications encouragethe development of hyperinfection syndrome.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for complete recovery is good for\nmost patients, except those with hyperinfection syn-drome or severe protein loss.\nPrevention\nThere is no effective immunization against thread-\nworm infection. Prevention of the disease requires care-ful attention to personal and institutional hygiene in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3292Threadworm infectionendemic areas, including handwashing after defecating\nand before handling food.

Group A streptococcal infections\nare potentially life-threatening, often involving otherparts of the body in addition to the throat. Besides caus-ing sore throat (pharyngitis), streptococci can also cause\nscarlet fever ,rheumatic fever , kidney disease, or\nabscesses around the tonsils.\nThroat cultures can also be used to identify other\ndisease organisms that are present in the patient’s throat;and to identify people who are carriers of the organismsthat cause meningitis and whooping cough . \nBesides their use in diagnosis, throat cultures are\nsometimes used to test antibiotics for their effectivenessin treating different infections. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3293Throat culturePrecautions\nThroat cultures should be taken before the patient is\ngiven any antibiotic medications. In addition, thepatient’s immunization history should be checked toevaluate the possibility that diseases other than strep arecausing the sore throat. The care provider should washthe hands carefully after taking the specimen to preventthe spread of any infectious organisms.\nDescription\nA throat culture test should be done on anyone who has\nsymptoms of a strep throat. These symptoms include a sorethroat that may be accompanied by a fever , body aches, and\nloss of appetite. Age is a consideration, in that strep throat ismore common in children than in adults. The tonsils and theback of the throat often appear red, swollen, and streakedwith pus. These symptoms usually appear one to three daysafter being exposed to group A strep. Because strep is high-ly contagious, family members and close contacts ofpatients diagnosed with strep throat should also have throatcultures performed if they show signs of the disease. \nThe specimen for throat culture is obtained by wip-\ning the patient’s throat with a cotton swab. The patient isasked to tilt the head back and open the mouth wide.With the tongue depressed and the patient saying “ah,”the care provider wipes the back of the throat and thetonsils with a sterile swab. The swab is applied to anyarea that appears either very red or discharging pus. The\nswab is removed gently without touching the teeth,gums, or tongue. It is then placed in a sterile tube forimmediate delivery to a laboratory. Obtaining the speci-men takes less than 30 seconds. Laboratory results areusually available in two to three days. The swabbing pro-cedure may cause gagging but is not painful. The doctormakes a note for the laboratory to indicate if any diseaseorganisms other than strep are suspected, because somerequire special growth conditions in the laboratory.\nS. pyogenes is cultured on a growth medium called\nblood agar. Agar is a gel that is made from the cell wallsof red algae. Blood agar is made from agar gel andsheep’s blood. When the throat swab reaches the labora-tory, it is wiped across a blood agar plate. The plate isallowed to incubate for 24–48 hours to allow the growthof bacteria. If the organism is a Group A hemolytic strep-tococcus, the area immediately around the bacterialcolony will be cleared of red blood cells. Hemolyticstreptococci dissolve (lyse) red blood cells, leaving aclear zone surrounding the colony.\nAlternative procedures\nSo-called instant strep tests are now available to help\ndiagnose strep throat. They can be used in the doctor’soffice and take about 10–30 minutes to perform. Instanttests detect an antigen associated with the streptococcus.These tests are relatively new and not available at allclinics. Their reliability has improved since they werefirst introduced. If an instant throat test is negative, how-ever, a standard throat culture can be performed to verifythe results.\nPreparation\nThe patient does not need to avoid food or fluids\nbefore the test. Recent gargling or treatment with antibi-otics, however, will affect the culture results. The labora-tory should be notified if the patient has been recentlytaking antibiotic medications.\nAftercare\nNo specific aftercare is needed.\nRisks\nThere is a minor risk for the health professional of\nexposure to the patient’s illness.\nNormal results\nNormal results would include finding organisms that\ngrow in healthy throat tissues. These organisms include\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3294Throat culture\nThis nurse is taking a throat culture from a patient for labo-\nratory analysis.

Infectious agents thatcan be identified include Candida albicans , which can\ncause thrush; Corynebacterium diphtheriae , which can\ncause diphtheria; and Bordetella pertussis , which can\ncause whooping cough .

    "content": "Thrombocytopenia\nDefinition\nThrombocytopenia is an abnormal drop in the num-\nber of blood cells involved in forming blood clots. Thesecells are called platelets.\nDescription\nThrombocytopenia is a blood disease characterized\nby an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood-stream. The normal amount of platelets is usuallybetween 150,000 and 450,000 cells per microliter ofblood. A microliter is an amount equal to one one-mil-lionth of a liter (a liter is almost equal to a quart). Plateletnumbers are counted by having a blood sample collectedand placing a measured amount of blood in a machinecalled a cell counter. When the platelet number dropsbelow 150,000 cells per microliter of blood, this personis said to be thrombocytopenic.\nCauses and symptoms\nAbnormal reductions in the number of platelets are\ncaused when abnormalities occur in any of the followingthree processes: decreased platelet production by thebone marrow; increased trapping of platelets by thespleen; or a more rapid than normal destruction ofplatelets. Persons with this condition easily bruise andcan have episodes of excess bleeding (a hemorrhage).\nPlatelets come from megakaryocytes, which are pro-\nduced in the material located within the center cavity ofthe bones (bone marrow). When abnormalities develop inthe marrow, the marrow cells can lose their ability to pro-duce platelets in correct amounts. The result is a lowerthan normal level of platelets in the blood. Drugs used incancer chemotherapy can cause the marrow to mal-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3295Thrombocytopeniafunction in this way, as can the presence of tumor cells in\nthe marrow itself.\nNormally, the spleen holds about one-third of the\nbody’s platelets as part of this organ’s function to recycleaging or damaged red blood cells (the cells that carry oxy-\ngen in the blood).

Devices placed inside blood vessels to keep themfrom closing (stents) due to weakened walls or fat build-up can also cause platelets to break down. In addition,infections and other changes in the immune system canspeed up the removal of platelets from the circulation.\nDiagnosis\nThrombocytopenia is diagnosed by having a blood\nsample taken and counting the platelets present in thesample. However, accurately determining the medicalreason for this conditions is complex.\nOnce a low platelet count is verified, a careful eval-\nuation of the function of the bone marrow and spleen arenecessary. Improper functioning of either or both ofthese organs can cause thrombocytopenia. In addition,the causes for the abnormal spleen or marrow functionmust be investigated since different cancers, blood disor-ders, or liver disease can be the true cause for the drop inplatelets found in the blood.\nTreatment\nIf low platelet counts are caused by an enlarged\nspleen, removal of the spleen can help raise the plateletlevel, since the spleen is no longer there to capture theplatelets. However, proper treatment for what causes theenlarged spleen is necessary as well.\nLow platelet counts can indicate more serious condi-\ntions. If a dysfunctional immune system is found to bethe cause for this condition, drugs like steroids or gammaglobulin can be used to help maintain platelet levels incertain cases.\nIf low platelet levels are due to an abnormally low\nlevel of platelet production, transfusions of platelets canbe given as well.\nPrognosis\nThrombocytopenia can result in fatal bleeding, but it\nalso can indicate various other, more serious, cancers andKEY TERMS\nGamma globulin —One of a group of proteins\nfound in the blood that is involved in helping thebody fight infections.\nStent —A man-made surgical device, usually tube-\nshaped, that is placed into a blood vessel to keepit from closing.\nTransfusion —The transfer of blood from one per-\nson to another.

Platelets are blood cells thatstick together, helping blood to clot. Thrombocytosis is acondition that may have many causes.\nThrobocytosis is classified as one of two types. Sec-\nondary thrombocytosis can be traced to another cause,such as inflammation, severe bleeding, iron deficiency,or some cancers. Primary thrombocytosis (or essentialthrombocythemia) is a single disease entity, with uniqueclinical characteristics. \nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of essential thrombocytosis is unknown.\nSecondary thrombocytosis may develop as a result of:\n• acute hemorrhage or infection • anemia • arthritis and other chronic inflammations \n• cancer \n• exercise • iron deficiency • medication \n• osteoporosis \n• removal of the spleen ( splenectomy ) \n• polycythemia vera (a disorder affecting other red blood\ncells, as well as platelets) \n• stress • surgery\nSymptoms\nTwo of every three patients who have thrombocyto-\nsis do not have any symptoms of the disease at the timeof diagnosis. Younger patients may remain symptom-freefor years.\nEnlargement of the spleen is detected in 60% of\npatients with thrombocytosis. The liver may also beenlarged. As many as half of all patients experiencebleeding from the skin, gums, or nose; and 20–50% havesome blockage of veins or arteries.\nOther symptoms of thrombocytosis include:\n• bloody stools \n• bruising \n• dizziness • headache • hemorrhage • prolonged bleeding after having surgery or after having\na tooth pulled \n• redness or tingling of the hands and feet • weakness. In rare instances, the lymph nodes become\nenlarged\nThe highest platelet counts usually produce the most\nsevere symptoms. Younger patients (especially women)may not have symptoms, even though their plateletcounts are very high.\nComplications\nComplications of thrombocytosis include stroke ,\nheart attack , and formation of blood clots in the arms\nand legs.\nA doctor should be notified whenever bleeding is\nunexplained or prolonged or the patient develops:\n• chest or leg pain\n• confusion • numbness • weakness\nDiagnosis\nThe patient’s symptoms suggest the presence of\nthrombocytosis. Blood tests confirm the diagnosis.\nBone marrow aspiration (removal of a tissue sample\nfor microscopic examination) may also be performed.\nTreatment\nThe key to treating secondary thrombocytosis is\ntreating the underlying condition.\nAny patient who has thrombocytosis should be\nencouraged not to smoke.\nIn young people who have no symptoms, this condi-\ntion can remain stable for many years. These patientsshould be monitored by a physician, but may not requiretreatment.\nTreatment for patients who do have symptoms\nfocuses on controlling bleeding, preventing the forma-tion of blood clots, and lowering platelet levels. Treat-ment for secondary thrombocytosis involves treating thecondition or disease responsible for excess platelet pro-duction.\nIn 1997, the United States Food and Drug Adminis-\ntration (FDA) approved the use of anagrelide HCl(Agrylin) to reduce elevated platelet counts and decreasethe risk of clot formation. Some patients have benefitedfrom the use of hydroxyurea, an anti-cancer drug.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3297ThrombocytosisLow doses of aspirin may prevent clotting, but can\ncause serious hemorrhages.\nIf drug therapy does not bring platelet counts down\nto an acceptable level as rapidly as necessary, platelet-pheresis may be performed. Usually combined with drugtherapy and used primarily in medical emergencies, thisprocedure consists of:\n• withdrawing blood from the patient’s body • removing platelets from the blood • returning the platelet-depleted blood to the patient\nPrognosis\nMany patients with thrombocytosis remain free of\ncomplications for long periods.

    "content": "Thrombolytic therapy\nDefinition\nThrombolytic therapy is the use of drugs that dis-\nsolve blood clots.\nPurpose\nWhen a blood clot forms in a blood vessel, it may\ncut off or severely reduce blood flow to parts of the bodythat are served by that blood vessel. This can cause seri-ous damage to those parts of the body. If the clot forms inan artery that supplies blood to the heart, for example, itcan cause a heart attack . A clot that cuts off blood to the\nbrain can cause a stroke . Thrombolytic therapy is used to\ndissolve blood clots that could cause serious, and possi-bly life-threatening, damage if they are not removed.Research suggests that when used to treat stroke, throm-bolytic therapy can prevent or reverse paralysis and\nother problems that otherwise might result.\nThrombolytic therapy also is used to dissolve blood\nclots that form in tubes put into people’s bodies for med-ical treatments, such as dialysis or chemotherapy .\nDescription\nThrombolytic therapy uses drugs called thrombolyt-\nic agents, such as alteplase (Activase), anistreplase (Emi-nase), streptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase), urokinase(Abbokinase), and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) todissolve clots. These drugs are given as injections, onlyunder a physician’s supervision.\nRecommended dosage\nThe physician supervising thrombolytic therapy\ndecides on the proper dose for each patient. He or she willtake into account the type of drug, the purpose for whichit is being used, and in some cases, the patient’s weight.\nPrecautions\nFor thrombolytic therapy to be effective in treating\nstroke or heart attack, prompt medical attention is veryimportant. The drugs must be given within a few hours ofthe beginning of a stroke or heart attack. However, thistreatment is not right for every patient who has a heartattack or a stroke. Only a qualified medical professionalcan decide whether a thrombolytic agent should be used.To increase the chance of survival and reduce the risk ofserious, permanent damage, anyone who has signs of aheart attack or stroke should get immediate medical help.\nThrombolytic therapy may cause bleeding. Usually\nthis is not serious, but severe bleeding does occur in somepeople. This is especially likely in older people. To lowerthe risk of serious bleeding, people who are given thisdrug should move around as little as possible and shouldnot try to get up on their own unless told to do so by ahealth care professional. Following all the instructions ofthe health care providers in charge is very important.\nThrombolytic therapy may be more likely to cause\nserious bleeding in people who have certain medical con-ditions or have recently had certain medical procedures.Before being given a thrombolytic agent, anyone with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3298Thrombolytic therapyany of these problems or conditions should tell the physi-\ncian in charge about it:\n• blood disease or current or past bleeding problems in\nany part of the body \n• heart or blood vessel disease \n• stroke (recent or in the past) \n• high blood pressure • brain tumor or other brain disease • stomach ulcer or colitis \n• severe liver disease \n• active tuberculosis\n• recent falls, injuries, or blows to the body or head • recent injections into a blood vessel • recent surgery, including dental surgery \n• tubes recently placed in the body for any reason \n• recent delivery of a baby\nIn addition, anyone who has had a recent streptococ-\ncal (strep) infection should tell the physician in charge.Some thrombolytic agents may not work properly in peo-ple who have just had a strep infection, so the physicianmay want to use a different drug.\nPeople who take certain medicines may be at greater\nrisk for severe bleeding when they are given a throm-bolytic agent.\nWomen who are pregnant should tell the physician in\ncharge before being given a thrombolytic agent. There is aslight chance that a woman who is given thrombolytic ther-apy during the first spell months of pregnancy will have a\nmiscarriage . However, streptokinase and urokinase have\nboth been used without problems in pregnant women.\nAfter being treated with thrombolytic therapy,\nwomen who are breastfeeding should check with theirphysicians before starting to breastfeed again.\nSide effects\nAnyone who has fever or who notices bleeding or\noozing from their gums, from cuts, or from the site wherethe thrombolytic agent was injected should immediatelytell their health care provider.\nPeople who are given thrombolytic therapy should\nalso be alert to the signs of bleeding inside the body andshould check with a physician immediately if any of thefollowing symptoms occur:\n• blood in the urine \n• blood or black, tarry stools \n• constipation KEY TERMS\nArteries —Blood vessels that carry blood away\nfrom the heart to the cells, tissues, and organs ofthe body.\nBlood clot —A hard mass that forms when blood\ngels.\nChemotherapy —Treatment of an illness with\nchemical agents.

    "title": "Thrombophlebitis",
    "content": "Thrombophlebitis\nDefinition\nThrombophlebitis is the inflammation of a vein with\nblood clot formation inside the vein at the site of inflam-mation. Thrombophlebitis is also known as phlebitis,phlebothrombosis, and venous thrombosis.\nDescription\nThere are two parts to thrombophlebitis, inflammation\nof a vein and blood clot formation. If the inflammationcomponent is minor, the disease is usually called venous orphlebothrombosis. Thrombophlebitis can occur in bothdeep veins and superficial veins, but most often occurs inthe superficial veins of the extremities (legs and arms).Most cases occur in the legs. When thrombophlebitisoccurs in a superficial vein, one that is near the surface ofthe skin and is visible to the eye, the disease is called super-ficial thrombophlebitis. Any form of injury to a blood ves-sel can result in thrombophlebitis. In the case of superficialthrombophlebitis, the blood clot usually attaches firmly tothe wall of the affected blood vein. Since superficial bloodveins do not have muscles that massage the veins, bloodclots in superficial veins tend to remain where they formand seldom break loose. When thrombophlebitis occurs ina deep vein, a vein that runs deep within muscle tissue, it iscalled deep venous thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosispresents the threat of producing blood clots that will breakloose to form emboli. These can lodge in other tissueswhere they can block the blood supply, typically in thelungs. This results in tissue damage and can sometimes beserious or fatal; for example, pulmonary embolism .Causes and symptoms\nThe main symptoms are tenderness and pain in the\narea of the affected vein. Redness and/or swelling mayalso be seen. In the case of deep venous thrombosis,there is more swelling than is caused by superficialthrombophlebitis, and the patient may experience musclestiffness in the affected area. There are many causes ofthrombophlebitis. The main causes can be grouped intothree categories; injury to blood veins, increased bloodclotting, and blood stasis. When blood veins are dam-aged, collagen in the blood vein wall is exposed.Platelets respond to collagen by initiating the clottingprocess. Damage to a vein can occur as a consequence ofindwelling catheters, trauma, infection, Buerger’s dis-\nease, or the injection of irritating substances. Increased\ntendency of the blood to clot can be caused by malignanttumors, genetic disorders, and oral contraceptives . Sta-\nsis, in which the blood clots due to decreased blood flowin an area, can happen following surgery, as a conse-quence of varicose veins , as a complication of postpar-\ntum states, and following prolonged bed rest. In the caseof prolonged bed rest, blood clots form because of inac-tivity, which allows blood to move sluggishly and stag-nate (collect) in blood veins. This can lead to blood clots.These clots (also called emboli) are sometimes releasedwhen the patient stands up and resumes activity. This canpresent a problem if the emboli lodge in vital organs. Inthe case of postpartum patients, a fever developing four\nto 10 days after delivery may indicate thrombophlebitis. \nDiagnosis\nIn superficial thrombophlebitis, the location of the\nclot can sometimes be seen by the unaided eye. Bloodclots are hard and can usually be detected by a physicianusing palpation (massage). Deep venous thrombosisrequires specialized diagnostic instruments to detect theblood clot. Among the instruments a physician may useare ultrasound and x ray, coupled with dye injection(venogram). \nTreatment\nSuperficial thrombophlebitis usually resolves with-\nout treatment. If treatment of superficial throm-bophlebitis is given, it is usually limited to the applica-tion of heat or anti-inflammatory drugs, like aspirin or\nibuprofen, which also help to relieve the pain. It can takefrom several days to several weeks for the clot to resolveand the symptoms to completely disappear. Rarely, anti-coagulant drugs may be administered. Deep venousthrombosis is a serious condition and is treated with anti-coagulant drugs and by keeping the affected limb elevat-ed. The primary objective in treating deep venous throm-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3300Thrombophlebitisbosis is prevention of a pulmonary embolism . The\npatient usually is hospitalized during initial treatment.The prescribed anticoagulant drugs limit the ability ofblood clots to grow and new clots to form. Sometimes, adrug that dissolves blood clots is administered. Thesedrugs must be used with caution because, as the clot dis-solves, it may release from the site where it formed andbecome an embolus. Surgery may be used if the affectedvein is likely to present a long term threat of producingblood clots that will release emboli. When superficialthrombophlebitis occurs in the groin, where the superfi-cial veins join the deep veins, the threat of emboli is pre-sent. In this case, blood clots formed in the superficialveins can extend into the much larger deep vein wherethey break off and are released into the blood stream. Theaffected veins are either removed or tied off to preventthe release of the blood clots. Tying off superficial bloodveins is an outpatient procedure that can be performedwith local anesthesia. The patient is capable of immedi-ately resuming normal activities.\nPrognosis\nSuperficial thrombophlebitis seldom progresses to a\nserious medical complication, although non-lethalembolisms may be produced. Deep venous thrombosismay lead to embolism, especially pulmonary embolism.This is a serious consequence of deep venous thrombo-sis, and is sometimes fatal.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAlexander, R. W., R. C.

    "content": "Thymoma\nDefinition\nThymomas are the most common tumor of the thy-\nmus.KEY TERMS\nEmboli, embolus —Emboli is the plural form of\nembolus. Embolus is any mass of air, blood clot, orforeign body that travels through the blood streamand is capable of lodging in smaller blood vesselswhere they obstruct the blood flow to that vessel. \nEmbolism —The obstruction of a blood vessel by a\nblot clot. \nPhlebitis —Inflammation of a vein.\nThrombus —A blood clot that forms within a blood\nvessel or the heart.\nDescription\nThe thymus is located in the upper chest just below\nthe neck. It is a small organ that produces certain types ofwhite blood cells before birth and during childhood.These white blood cells are called lymphocytes and arean important part of the body‘s immune system. Oncereleased from the thymus, lymphocytes travel to lymphnodes where they help to fight infections. The thymusgland becomes smaller in adulthood and is graduallytaken over by fat tissue.\nAlthough rare, thymomas are the most common\ntype of thymic cancer . They arise from thymic epithe-\nlial cells, which make up the covering of the thymus.Thymomas frequently contain lymphocytes, which arenoncancerous. Thymomas are classified as either nonin-vasive (previously called “benign”) or invasive (previ-ously called “malignant”). Noninvasive thymomas arethose in which the tumor is encapsulated and easy toremove. Invasive thymomas have spread to nearby struc-tures (such as the lungs) and are difficult to remove.Approximately 30% to 40% of thymomas are of theinvasive type.\nThymoma affects men and women equally. It is usu-\nally diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60 years. Thy-momas are uncommon in children.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of thymoma is unknown. Cancer is\ncaused when the normal mechanisms that control cellgrowth become disturbed, causing the cells to continual-ly grow without stopping. This is caused by damage tothe DNA in the cell.\nApproximately 40% of the patients diagnosed with\nthymoma have no symptoms. The symptoms in the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3301Thymomaremaining 60% of patients are caused by pressure from\nthe enlarged thymus on the windpipe (trachea) or bloodvessels, or by paraneoplastic syndromes. Paraneoplasticsyndromes are collections of symptoms in cancerpatients that cannot be explained by the tumor. Seventy-one percent of thymomas are associated with paraneo-plastic syndromes. The most common syndromes relat-ed to thymoma are pure red cell aplasia (having abnor-mally low levels of red blood cells), myasthenia gravis\n(a muscular disorder), and hypogammaglobulinemia(having abnormally low levels of antibodies). Theseconditions are autoimmune diseases—those in whichthe body mounts an attack against certain normal cellsof the body.\nSymptoms of thymoma may include:\n•shortness of breath\n• swelling of the face• coughing• chest pain• muscle weakness (especially in the eyes, neck, and\nchest, causing problems with vision, swallowing, andbreathing)\n• weakness• dizziness• shortness of breath•fatigue\nDiagnosis\nThe physician will conduct a complete physical\nexam. He or she may be able to feel a fullness in thelower neck region. Routine blood tests may be per-formed. Imaging studies are necessary because thesymptoms of thymoma can be caused by many other dis-eases. Thymomas can be identified by chest x ray ,mag-\nnetic resonance imaging , and computed tomography.\nA biopsy may be performed, in which a small sam-\nple of the tumor is removed and examined under themicroscope. However, because of the risk of “seeding”cancerous cells, biopsies are not routinely performed.There are a few different methods to biopsy a thymoma.For a mediastinoscopy , a wand-like lighted camera\n(endoscope) and special instruments are passed through asmall cut in the lower neck. The surgeon can see thetumor on a monitor and can cut off small samples formicroscopic analysis. Mediastinoscopy is performedunder general anesthesia. Alternatively, a needle biopsywill be taken in which a long needle is passed throughthe skin and into the tumor. Fine needle biopsy uses athin needle and larger-core needle biopsy uses a widerneedle. Needle biopsies may be performed in conjunc-\ntion with CT imaging.\nPatients who are having difficulty breathing may\nhave a bronchoscopy performed to examine the wind\npipe. An endoscope, in this case a bronchoscope, isinserted through the mouth and into the windpipe. Thephysician will look for tumors and may perform biop-sies.\nTreatment\nClinical staging\nThere is more than one type of staging system for\nthymoma; but the Masaoka system, a surgical stagingsystem developed in 1981, is used most often. Thymomais categorized into four stages (I, II, III, and IV), whichmay be further subdivided (A and B) based on thespread of cancerous tissue. The Masaoka staging systemis as follows:\n• Stage I. The thymoma lies completely within the thy-\nmus.\n• Stage II. The thymoma has spread out of the thymus\nand invaded the outer layer of the lung (pleura) or near-by fatty tissue.\n• Stage III. The thymoma has spread to other neighboring\ntissues of the upper chest, including the outer layer ofthe heart (pericardium), the lungs, or the heart‘s mainblood vessels.\n• Stage IV A. The thymoma has spread throughout the\npericardium and/or the pleura.\n• Stage IVB. The thymoma has spread to organs in other\nparts of the body.\nIn 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO)\nadopted a new classification system for thymic tumors.This system is a histologic classification, which meansthat it is based on the microscopic features of the cellsthat make up the tumor. The WHO classification systemranks thymomas into types A, AB, B1, B2, B3, and C, byincreasing severity.\nThe treatment for thymoma depends on the stage of\ncancer and the patients overall health. Because thymo-mas are so rare, there are no defined treatment plans.Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy ,\nand/or chemotherapy . Surgical removal of the tumor is\nthe preferred treatment. Surgery is often the only treat-ment required for stage I tumors. Treatment of thymomaoften relieves the symptoms caused by paraneoplasticsyndromes.\nA treatment that is intended to aid the primary treat-\nment is called adjuvant therapy. For instance, chemother-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3302Thymomaapy may be used along with surgery to treat thymoma.\nStages II, III, and IV thymomas are often treated withsurgery and some form of adjuvant therapy.\nSurgery\nThymoma may be treated by surgically removing\n(resecting) the tumor and some of the nearby healthy tis-sue. Removal of the entire thymus gland is called athymectomy. Surgery on the thymus is usually performedthrough the chest wall by splitting open the breast bone(sternum), a procedure called a median sternotomy.When complete removal of the tumor is impossible, thesurgeon will remove as much of the tumor as possible(debulking surgery, subtotal resection). In these cases, Ifthe tumor has spread, surgery may include removal ofsuch other tissues as the pleura, pericardium, blood ves-sels of the heart, lung, and nerves.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy radiation from x\nrays and gamma rays to kill the cancer cells. Radiationgiven from a machine that is outside the body is calledexternal radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is oftenused as adjuvant therapy following surgery to reduce thechance of cancer recurrence. Radiation may be used tokill cancer cells in cases in which the tumor was onlypartially removed. It may be used before surgery toshrink a large tumor. Radiation therapy is not very effec-tive when used alone, although it may be used alonewhen the patient is too sick to withstand surgery.\nThe skin in the treated area may become red and dry\nand may take as long as a year to return to normal. Radi-ation to the chest may damage the lung, causing short-ness of breath and other breathing problems. Also, thetube that goes between the mouth and stomach (esopha-gus) may be irritated by radiation, causing swallowingdifficulties. Fatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea , and nau-\nsea are also common complaints of patients having radia-tion therapy. Most side effects go away about two tothree weeks after radiation therapy has ended.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to kill the\ncancer cells. The drugs are given by mouth (orally) orintravenously. They enter the bloodstream and cantravel to all parts of the body. Chemotherapy may begiven before surgery to shrink a tumor, which is calledneoadjuvant therapy. Thymoma cells are very sensitiveto anticancer drugs, especially cisplatin, doxorubicin,and ifosfamide. Generally, a combination of drugs isgiven because it is more effective than a single drug intreating cancer. Corticosteroids are also used to treat\nthymoma.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy are significant;\nand include stomach upset, vomiting, appetite loss, hairloss ( alopecia ), mouth sores, and fatigue. Women may\nexperience vaginal sores, menstrual cycle changes, andpremature menopause . There is also an increased\nchance of infections.\nAlternative treatment\nAlthough alternative and complementary therapies\nare used by many cancer patients, very few controlledstudies on the effectiveness of such therapies exist.Mind-body techniques such as prayer, biofeedback ,\nvisualization, meditation , and yoga , have not shown any\neffect in reducing cancer; but they can reduce stress and\nlessen some of the side effects of cancer treatments. Ger-son, macrobiotic, orthomolecular, and Cancell therapiesare ineffective treatments for cancer.\nClinical studies of hydrazine sulfate found that it had\nno effect on cancer and even worsened the health andwell-being of the study subjects. One clinical study of thedrug amygdalin (Laetrile) found that it had no effect oncancer. Laetrile can be toxic and has caused deaths. Sharkcartilage has been studied as a cancer treatment and ispresently being studied by the FDA in clinical studies.Although the results are mixed, clinical studies suggestthat melatonin may increase the survival time and qualityof life for cancer patients.\nSelenium, in safe doses, may delay the progression\nof cancer. Laboratory and animal studies suggest thatcurcumin, the active ingredient of turmeric, has anti-cancer activity. Maitake mushrooms may boost theimmune system, according to laboratory and animalstudies. The results of laboratory studies suggest thatmistletoe has anticancer properties; however, clinicalstudies have not been conducted in the United States yet.\nPrognosis\nThe five-year survival rates for thymomas are 96%\nfor stage I, 86% for stage II, 69% for stage III, and 50%for stage IV . Thorough (radical) surgery is associatedwith a longer survival rate. Almost 15% of thymomapatients develop a second cancer.\nThymomas rarely spread (metastasize) outside of\nthe chest cavity. Metastasis is usually limited to the pleu-ra. Invasive thymomas are prone to recurrence, even 10to 15 years following surgery. The recurrence rates aredrastically reduced and the five-year survival rates aredrastically increased in patients who receive adjuvantradiation therapy. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3303ThymomaPrevention\nBecause there are no known risk factors for the\ndevelopment of thymoma, there are no preventive mea-sures.

    "title": "Thyroid biopsy",
    "content": "Thyroid biopsy\nDefinition\nThe thyroid biopsy is a procedure in which a sample\nof thyroid tissue is withdrawn for laboratory examina-tion. The sample can be withdrawn through a needle or asurgical incision may be made to obtain a piece of thy-roid tissue.\nPurpose\nThe test is generally performed when a lump or a\nnodule is detected in the thyroid. The test may also beordered if the thyroid gland is enlarged and the cause isnot apparent. The biopsy is usually a test for thyroid\ncancer .\nPrecautions\nA patient with a bleeding disorder should not have a\nbiopsy unless the bleeding problem can be corrected by atransfusion of the cells that cause blood to clot\n(platelets).\nDescription\nThe thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at\nthe base of the neck. It produces thyroxine, a hormonethat plays a very crucial role in regulating the metabo-lism of the body and controlling several vital functions,such as the heart beat, blood pressure, and body temper-ature. The thyroid also regulates childhood growth anddevelopment.\nA thyroid biopsy is usually ordered when a pain-\nless lump or a nodule is detected, either by the patientor by a doctor during a routine physical examination .\nA biopsy is the only test that can accurately determinewhether the lump is non-cancerous (benign) or cancer-ous (malignant). The biopsy can be performed in sever-al ways.\nThe “fine needle aspiration” (FNA) can be done in\nthe doctor’s office. An anesthetic is not usually given.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3304Thyroid biopsyThe patient will be asked to lie on his or her back. A pil-\nlow will be placed under the shoulders and the neck willbe extended. The biopsy site will be cleansed with a ster-ile antiseptic solution. A thin needle will be inserted intothe thyroid, and a sample of thyroid cells and some fluidwill be collected. The needle will be quickly withdrawn.Pressure will be applied at the biopsy site to stop thebleeding and a bandage may be used to cover the area.The test takes three to five minutes.\nFor “large needle biopsy,” a mild sedative may be\ngiven an hour before the procedure, to relax thepatient. The patient will be asked to lie on his or herback, with the head tipped back and the neck extended.The biopsy site will be thoroughly cleansed and thephysician will inject a local anesthetic. A small inci-sion (about 1 inch) will be made in the skin. The biop-sy needle will be inserted through the incision into thethyroid. A sample of tissue will be removed and theneedle withdrawn. Pressure is applied at the biopsy siteto stem the bleeding and a bandage applied. This testtakes five to ten minutes.\nThe “open incisional biopsy” is done in an operat-\ning room by a surgeon. The patient will be given a gen-eral anesthetic. A sedative will be given an hour beforethe procedure to relax the patient. An intravenous linewill be placed in the arm for infusion of fluids ordrugs. An endotracheal tube will be inserted throughthe mouth into the lungs for administering anestheticgases. After the patient is anesthetized, a small incisionis made in the neck. Either the whole thyroid or a partof it is removed. If only a portion is being removed, thesurgeon may send a small piece of remaining tissue tothe laboratory for immediate testing while the patientis still on the operating table. If the pathologist’s reportcomes back stating that cancer is present in the\nremaining tissue, the entire thyroid is removed. Theincision is closed with stitches. The whole proceduremay take about an hour.\nPreparation\nThe doctor should be informed of any allergies to\nmedications and every medication the patient is taking. Ifthe patient is pregnant, the doctor should be told.\nThe patient will be asked to sign the necessary con-\nsent forms. If a needle biopsy is done, no special prepara-tion is needed. If a large needle biopsy is being done, thedoctor may order some tests to determine the clottingability of the blood. If an open incisional biopsy is beingdone, a general anesthetic is required and the patient willbe asked to refrain from eating or drinking anything 8-12hours before the test.Aftercare\nThe needle used in fine needle aspiration is so thin,\nthe whole procedure feels like a quick injection. There isno pain or tenderness at the site after the test. In large\nneedle biopsy, a stinging needle prick may be felt whenthe local anesthetic is injected. The site may be sore for afew hours and tender for a day or two after the test.\nIn the open incisional biopsy, the patient will feel\nnothing during the procedure, because of the effects ofthe anesthetic and the sedative. However, the anestheticmay cause the patient to feel drowsy for several hoursafter the procedure. The anesthetic may also cause thepatient to experience some fatigue , and general aches\nand pains for a day or two after the procedure. The endo-tracheal tube may make the throat feel mildly sore. Ifthere is swelling at the biopsy site or if the patient devel-ops a fever , the doctor should be notified immediately.\nRisks\nNo risks are associated with fine needle aspiration.\nLarge needle biopsy may cause bleeding into the thyroidgland. There is a small risk that the anesthetic used in opensurgical biopsy may cause a life-threatening reaction.\nNormal results\nThe normal appearance and architecture of the thy-\nroid cells indicate that no cancer cells are present in thethyroid tissue.\nAbnormal results\nAny abnormalities of the thyroid tissue cells may\nindicate cancer, benign tumors, or some other thyroiddisease. If cancer is suspected, the pathologist may dosome more testing to identify the extent of the cancer sothat it can be treated appropriately.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Patient’s Guide to Medical Tests.

The types arepapillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic thyroidcancers. They grow at different rates and can spread toother parts of the body if left untreated. \nThe thyroid is a hormone-producing butterfly-shaped\ngland located in the neck at the base of the throat. It hastwo lobes, the left and the right. The thyroid uses iodine, amineral found in some foods, to make several of its hor-mones. Thyroid hormones regulate essential body\nprocesses such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temper-ature, metabolism; and affect the nervous system, musclesand other organs. These hormones also play an importantrole in regulating childhood growth and development.\nDiseases of the thyroid gland affect millions of\nAmericans. The most common diseases of the thyroid areeither hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease) or hypothy-\nroidism , an overactive or an underactive gland, respec-\ntively. Sometimes lumps or masses may develop in thethyroid, and although most (ninety-five percent) of theselumps or nodules are noncancerous (benign), all thyroidlumps should be taken seriously. The American CancerSociety estimates that the approximately 17,200 newcases of thyroid cancer that occur in the United Statesaccount for 1% of all cancers.\nWomen are three times more likely to develop thy-\nroid cancer than men. Although the disease affectsteenagers and young adults, most people that developthyroid cancer are over 50 years of age. KEY TERMS\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and microscopic\nexamination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.\nEndotracheal tube —A hollow tube that is inserted\ninto the windpipe (trachea), leading to the lungs.\nPathologist —A doctor who specializes in the\ndiagnosis of disease by studying cells and tissuesunder a microscope.Causes and symptoms\nThe exact cause of thyroid cancer is not known; but\nit is more common in whites than in African Americans.Radiation was used in the 1950s and 1960s to treat acne\nand to reduce swelling in infections of the tonsils, ade-noids and lymph nodes. It has been proven that thisexposure is a risk factor for thyroid cancer. In someareas of the world, diets are low in iodine. Papillary and\nfollicular cancers occur more frequently in these areas.Iodine deficiency is not a large problem in the UnitedStates because iodine is added to table salt and otherfoods. Approximately 7% of thyroid cancers are causedby the alteration (mutation) of a gene called the RETgene, which can be inherited.\nSymptoms are rare so the lump is not usually painful.\nThe symptoms of thyroid nodules are:\n• a lump or nodule that can be felt in the neck is the most\nfrequent sign of thyroid cancer\n• the lymph nodes may be swollen and the voice may\nbecome hoarse because the tumor presses on the nervesleading to the voice box\n• some patients experience a tight or full feeling in the\nneck and have difficulty breathing or swallowing\nDiagnosis\nPhysicians use several tests to confirm the suspi-\ncion of thyroid cancer, to identify the size and locationof the lump and to determine whether the lump is non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Bloodtests such as the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)test check thyroid function. These are drawn by a tech-nician with a needle and take a few minutes. It takesseveral days to be interpreted by a pathologist. Calci-tonin is produced by the C cells (parafollicular cells) ofthe thyroid gland when the parafollicular cells of thethyroid become cancerous. Blood calcitonin levels areused to confirm the diagnosis of medullary thyroid can-cer if it is suspected.\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan) or an ultra-\nsonography (ultrasound scan) are imaging tests used toproduce a picture of the thyroid and usually last less thanone hour. A radiologist usually interprets the resultswithin 24 hours. In ultrasonography, high-frequencysound waves are bounced off the thyroid. The pattern ofechoes that is produced by these waves is converted intoa computerized image on a television screen. This testcan determine whether the lumps found in the thyroid arebenign fluid-filled cysts or solid malignant tumors.\nA radioactive scan may take several hours and can\nbe used to identify any abnormal areas in the thyroid\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3306Thyroid cancerby giving the patient a very small amount of radioac-\ntive iodine, which can either be swallowed or injectedinto the thyroid. Since the thyroid is the only gland inthe body that absorbs iodine, the radioactive iodineaccumulates there. An x-ray image can then be takenor an instrument called a “scanner” can be used toidentify areas in the thyroid that do not absorb iodinenormally. These abnormal spots are called “coldspots” and further tests are performed to checkwhether the cold spots are benign or malignanttumors. If a significant amount of radioactive iodine isconcentrated in the nodule, then it is termed “hot” andis usually benign. Again a radiologist interprets theresults within a day.\nThe most accurate diagnostic tool for thyroid cancer\nis a biopsy. In this process a sample of thyroid tissue iswithdrawn and examined under a microscope by apathologist. This usually takes a day or so. The tissuesamples can be obtained either by drawing out a sampleof tissue through a needle (needle biopsy) or by surgicalremoval of the nodule (surgical biopsy). A needle biopsytakes a few minutes and can be done by any trainedphysician, usually a radiologist. The surgical biopsy isdone by a surgeon under general anesthesia with the helpof an anesthesiologist and will take a few hours. If thy-roid cancer is diagnosed, further tests may be done tolearn about the stage of the disease and help doctors planappropriate treatment.\nTreatment\nThe aggressiveness of each type of thyroid cancer is\ndifferent. Cancer staging considers the size of the tumor,whether it has grown into surrounding lymph nodes andwhether it has spread to distant parts of the body (metas-tasized). Age and general health status are also taken intoaccount. In patients less than 45 years old there are onlytwo stages. I papillary or follicular type thyroid cancer,stage I refers to patients without evidence of cancer thathas spread to the body. Stage II refers to patients withspread of cancer outside the thyroid gland. In patientsover 45, patients with tumors smaller than one cm areclassified as stage I, those with tumors not brokenthrough the capsule (covering) of the thyroid belong tostage II, those with tumors outside the capsule or lymphnode involvement are called stage III and those withspread outside the thyroid area are stage IV . Inmedullary-type thyroid cancer, stage I and IV are thesame. Stage II consists of patients with tumors greaterthan one cm and stage III comprises patients with lymphnode involvement.\nThe papillary type (60–80% of all thyroid cancers)\nis a slow-growing cancer that develops in the hormone-producing cells (that contain iodine) and can be treated\nsuccessfully. The follicular type (30–50% of thyroidcancers) also develops in the hormone-producing cells,has a good cure rate but may be difficult to control ifthe cancer invades blood vessels or grows into nearbystructures in the neck. The medullary type (5–7% of allthyroid cancers) develops in the parafollicular cells(also known as the C cells) that produce calcitonin, ahormone that does not contain iodine. Medullary thy-roid cancers are more difficult to control because theyoften spread to other parts of the body. The fourth typeof thyroid cancer, anaplastic (2% of all thyroid can-cers), is the fastest growing and is usually fatal becausethe cancer cells rapidly spread to the different parts ofthe body.\nMore than 90% of patients who are treated for papil-\nlary or follicular cancer will live for 15 years or longerafter the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Eighty percent ofpatients with medullary thyroid cancer will live for atleast 10 years after surgery. Only 3–17% of patients withanaplastic cancer survive for five years.\nLike most cancers, cancer of the thyroid is best treat-\ned when it is found early by a primary physician. Treat-ment depends on the type of cancer and its stage. Fourtypes of treatment are used: surgical removal, radiation\ntherapy , hormone therapy and chemotherapy . Surgical\nremoval is the usual treatment if the cancer has notspread to distant parts of the body.\nThe surgeon may remove the side or lobe of the thy-\nroid where the cancer is found (lobectomy) or all of it(total thyroidectomy ). If the adjoining lymph nodes are\naffected, they may also be removed during surgery.When the thyroid gland is removed and levels of thyroidhormones decrease, the pituitary gland starts to produceTSH that stimulates the thyroid cells to grow.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3307Thyroid cancer\nA gamma scan of the human thyroid gland revealing cancer.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)A radiation-oncologist uses radiation therapy with\nhigh-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.The radiation may come from a machine outside thebody (external beam radiation), or the patient may beasked to swallow a drink containing radioactive iodine.Because the thyroid cells take up iodine, the radioactiveiodine collects in any thyroid tissue remaining in thebody and kills the cancer cells. A hematologist-oncolo-gist uses chemotherapy either as a pill or an injectionthrough a vein in the arm.\nAlternative treatment\nHormone therapy uses hormones after surgery to\nstop this growth and the formation of new cancerous thy-roid cells. To prevent cancerous growth, the natural hor-mones that are produced by the thyroid are taken in theform of pills. Thus, their levels remain normal and inhibitthe pituitary gland from making TSH. If the cancer hasspread to other parts of the body and surgery is not possi-ble, hormone treatment is aimed at killing or slowing thegrowth of cancer cells throughout the body.\nA powerful phytochemical, lycopene, gives toma-\ntoes their red color and appears to act as an antioxidantin the body, repairing damaged cells and scavengingfree radicals, the molecules responsible for most typesof degenerative diseases and aging . Antioxidants such\nas lycopene help inhibit DNA oxidation, which canlead to certain forms of cancer. Lycopene is a normalconstituent of human blood and tissues, where it isfound in greater concentrations than beta-carotene orany other carotenoid. Tomatoes, including cooked orprocessed tomatoes, tomato juices, soups, sauces, pasteand ketchup, contain more lycopene than any otherfood. Guava, rose hip, watermelon and grapefruit alsocontain lycopene.\nOther antioxidants are: vitamin E (Dosage: 400 IU\ndaily), vitamin C (Dosage: 1,000 to 4,000 mg daily),beta carotene (Dosage: 15 mg (25,000 IU) daily), lutein(Dosage: 6 to 20 mg daily), pycnogenol (Dosage: 25 to50 mg daily), green tea (Dosage: 300 to 400 mg of greentea polyphenols daily), grape-seed extract (Dosage: 100mg daily), alpha lipoic acid (Dosage: 50 to 200 mgdaily), N-acetylcysteine (Dosage: 600 mg daily) andselenium (Dosage: 200 to 400 mcg daily). Pregnantwomen should consult a physician before taking anymedication.\nPrevention\nBecause most people with thyroid cancer have no\nknown risk factor, it is not possible to completely preventthis disease.

    "content": "Thyroid function tests\nDefinition\nThyroid function tests are blood tests used to evalu-\nate how effectively the thyroid gland is working. Thesetests include the thyroid-stimulating hormone test (TSH),the thyroxine test (T\n4), the triiodothyronine test (T3), the\nthyroxine-binding globulin test (TBG), the triiodothyro-nine resin uptake test (T\n3RU), and the long-acting thyroid\nstimulator test (LATS).\nPurpose\nThyroid function tests are used to:\n• help diagnose an underactive thyroid ( hypothyroidism )\nand an overactive thyroid ( hyperthyroidism )\n• evaluate thyroid gland activity\n• monitor response to thyroid therapy\nPrecautions\nThyroid treatment must be stopped one month\nbefore blood is drawn for a thyroxine (T4) test.\nSteroids, propranolol (Inderal), cholestyramine\n(Questran), and other medications that may influencethyroid activity are usually stopped before a triiodothyro-nine (T\n3) test.\nEstrogens, anabolic steroids, phenytoin, and thyroid\nmedications may be discontinued prior to a thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) test. The laboratory analyzing theblood sample must be told if the patient cannot stop tak-ing any of these medications. Some patients will be toldto take these medications as usual so that the doctor candetermine how they affect thyroxine-binding globulin.\nPatients are asked not to take estrogens, androgens,\nphenytoin (Dilantin), salicylates, and thyroid medicationsbefore having a triiodothyronine resin uptake (T\n3RU) test.\nPrior to taking a long-acting thyroid stimulant\n(LATS) test, the patient will probably be told to stop tak-ing all drugs that could affect test results.Description\nMost doctors consider the sensitive thyroid-stimulat-\ning hormone (TSH) test to be the most accurate measureof thyroid activity. By measuring the level of TSH, doc-tors can determine even small problems in thyroid activi-ty. Because this test is sensitive, abnormalities in thyroidfunction can be determined before a patient complains ofsymptoms.\nTSH “tells” the thyroid gland to secrete the hor-\nmones thyroxine (T\n4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Before\nTSH tests were used, standard blood tests measured lev-els of T\n4and T3to determine if the thyroid gland was\nworking properly. The triiodothyrine (T3) test measures\nthe amount of this hormone in the blood. T3is normally\npresent in very small amounts, but has a significantimpact on metabolism. It is the active component of thy-roid hormone.\nThe thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) test measures\nblood levels of this substance, which is manufactured inthe liver. TBG binds to T\n3and T4, prevents the kidneys\nfrom flushing the hormones from the blood, and releasesthem when and where they are needed to regulate bodyfunctions.\nThe triiodothyronine resin uptake (T\n3RU) test mea-\nsures blood T4levels. Laboratory analysis of this test\ntakes several days, and it is used less often than testswhose results are available more quickly.\nThe long-acting thyroid stimulator (LATS) test\nshows whether blood contains long-acting thyroid stimu-lator. Not normally present in blood, LATS causes thethyroid to produce and secrete abnormally high amountsof hormones.\nIt takes only minutes for a nurse or medical techni-\ncian to collect the blood needed for these blood tests. Aneedle is inserted into a vein, usually in the forearm, anda small amount of blood is collected and sent to a labora-tory for testing. The patient will usually feel minor dis-comfort from the “stick” of the needle.\nPreparation\nThere is no need to make any changes in diet or\nactivities. The patient may be asked to stop taking certainmedications until after the test is performed.\nAftercare\nWarm compresses can be used to relieve swelling or\ndiscomfort at the site of the puncture. With a doctor’sapproval, the patient may start taking medicationsstopped before the test.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3309Thyroid function testsNormal results\nNot all laboratories measure or record thyroid hor-\nmone levels the same way. Each laboratory will providea range of values that are considered normal for each test.Some acceptable ranges are listed below.\nTSH\nNormal TSH levels for adults are 0.5–5.0 mU/L. \nT\n4\nNormal T4levels are:\n• 10.1–2.0 ug/dl at birth \n• 7.5–16.5 ug/dl at one to four months • 5.5–14.5 ug/dl at four to 12 months • 5.6–12.6 ug/dl at one to six years • 4.9–11.7 ug/dl at six to 10 years \n• 4–11 ug/dl at 10 years and older. \nLevels of free T\n4(thyroxine not attached to TBG) are\nhigher in teenagers than in adults.\nNormal T4levels do not necessarily indicate normal\nthyroid function.

    "content": "Thyroid hormones\nDefinition\nThyroid hormones are artificially made hormones\nthat make up for a lack of natural hormones produced bythe thyroid gland.\nPurpose\nThe thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped structure in the\nlower part of the neck, normally produces a hormone\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3312Thyroid hormonescalled thyroxine. This hormone controls the rate of\nmetabolism—all the physical and chemical processesthat occur in cells to allow growth and maintain bodyfunctions. When the thyroid gland does not produceenough thyroxine, body processes slow down. Peoplewith underactive thyroid glands feel unusually tired andmay gain weight even though they eat less. They mayalso have trouble staying warm and may have othersymptoms, such as dry skin, dry hair, and a puffy face.By making up for the lack of natural thyroxine and bring-ing the rate of metabolism back to normal, artificiallymade thyroid hormone improves these symptoms.\nThyroid hormones also may be used to treat goiter\n(enlarged thyroid gland) and certain types of thyroid\ncancer .\nDescription\nThyroid hormones, also called thyroid drugs, are\navailable only with a physician’s prescription. They aresold in tablet form. A commonly used thyroid hormone islevothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, Levothroid).\nRecommended dosage\nFor adults and teenagers, the usual starting dose of\nlevothyroxine tablets is 0.0125 mg (12.5 micrograms) to0.05 mg (50 micrograms) per day. The physician whoprescribes the medicine may gradually increase the doseover time.\nFor children, the dose depends on body weight and\nmust be determined by a physician.\nTaking thyroid hormones exactly as directed is very\nimportant. The physician who prescribes the medicinewill figure out exactly how much of the medicine apatient needs. Taking too much or too little can make thethyroid gland overactive or underactive.\nThis medicine should be taken at the same time\nevery day.\nPrecautions\nPeople who take thyroid hormones because their\nthyroid glands do not produce enough natural hormonemay need to take the medicine for the rest of their lives.Seeing a physician regularly while taking this medicineis important. The physician will make sure that the medi-cine is working and that the dosage is correct.\nIn patients with certain kinds of heart disease, this\nmedicine may cause chest pains and shortness of breath\nduring exercise . People who have this problem should be\ncareful not to exert themselves too much. Anyone who is taking thyroid hormones should be\nsure to tell the health care professional in charge beforehaving any surgical or dental procedures or receivingemergency treatment.\nThis medicine is safe to take during pregnancy ,b u t\nthe dosage may need to be changed. Women who arepregnant should check with their physicians to make surethey are taking the proper dosage.\nAnyone who has had unusual reactions to thyroid\nhormones in the past should let his or her physician knowbefore taking the drugs again. The physician should alsobe told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,\nor other substances.\nBefore using thyroid hormones, people with any of\nthese medical problems should make sure their physi-cians are aware of their conditions:\n• heart disease • high blood pressure • hardening of the arteries • diabetes • history of overactive thyroid • underactive adrenal gland • underactive pituitary gland\nSide effects\nThis medicine usually does not cause side effects if\nthe dosage is right. Certain symptoms may be signs thatthe dose needs to be changed. Check with a physician ifany of these symptoms occur:\n• headache •fever\n• diarrhea • vomiting • changes in appetite • weight loss • changes in menstrual period • tremors of the hands • leg cramps • increased sensitivity to heat • sweating • irritability • nervousness • sleep problems\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3313Thyroid hormonesOther side effects are possible. Anyone who has\nunusual symptoms while taking thyroid hormones shouldget in touch with his or her physician.\nInteractions\nThyroid hormones may interact with other medi-\ncines. This may increase or decrease the effects of thethyroid medicine and may interfere with treatment. Any-one who takes thyroid hormones should not take anyother prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter)medicines without the approval of his or her physician.Among the drugs that may interact with thyroid hor-mones are:\n• Medicine for colds, hay fever, and other allergies \n• Medicine for asthma and other breathing problems \n• Medicine for diabetes \n• Blood thinners \n• Amphetamines \n• Diet pills (appetite suppressants) \n• Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as cholestyramine\n(Questran) and colestipol (Colestid)\nNancy Ross-Flanigan"

    "content": "Thyroid nuclear medicine scan\nDefinition\nA thyroid nuclear medicine scan is a diagnostic pro-\ncedure to evaluate the thyroid gland, which is located inthe front of the neck and controls the body’s metabolism.KEY TERMS\nAdrenal glands —A pair of glands located next to\nthe kidneys. The adrenal glands produce hor-mones that control many body functions.\nHormone —A chemical that is produced in one\npart of the body and then travels through thebloodstream to another part of the body where ithas its effect.\nPituitary gland —A pea-sized gland at the base of\nthe brain that produces many hormones that affectgrowth and body functions.A radioactive substance that concentrates in the thyroid\nis taken orally or injected into a vein (intravenously), orboth. A special camera is used to take an image of thedistribution of the radioactive substance in and aroundthe thyroid gland. This is interpreted to evaluate thyroidfunction and to diagnose abnormalities.\nPurpose\nA thyroid scan may be ordered by a physician when\nthe gland becomes abnormally large, especially if theenlargement is greater on one side, or when hard lumps(nodules) are felt. The scan can be helpful in determiningwhether the enlargement is caused by a diffuse increase inthe total amount of thyroid tissue or by a nodule or nodules.\nWhen other laboratory studies show an overactive\nthyroid ( hyperthyroidism ) or an underactive thyroid\n(hypothyroidism ), a radioactive iodine uptake scan is\noften used to confirm the diagnosis. It is frequently donealong with a thyroid scan.\nPrecautions\nWomen who are pregnant should not have this test.\nDescription\nThis test is performed in a radiology facility, either\nin an outpatient x ray center or a hospital department.Most often, the patient is given the radioactive substancein the form of a tasteless liquid or capsule. It may beinjected into a vein (intravenously) in some instances.Images will be taken at a specified amount of time afterthis, depending on the radioisotope used. Most often,scanning is done 24 hours later, if the radioisotope isgiven orally. If it is given intravenously, the scan is per-formed approximately 20 minutes later.\nFor a thyroid scan, the patient is positioned lying\ndown on his or her back, with the head tilted back. Theradionuclide scanner, also called a gamma camera, ispositioned above the thyroid area as it scans. This takes30-60 minutes.\nThe uptake study may be done with the patient sit-\nting upright in a chair or lying down. The procedure isotherwise the same as described for the thyroid scan. Ittakes approximately 15 minutes. There is no discomfortinvolved with either study.\nA thyroid scan may also be referred to as a thyroid\nscintiscan. The name of the radioactive substance usedmay be incorporated and the study called a technetiumthyroid scan or an iodine thyroid scan. The radioactiveiodine uptake scan may be called by its initials, an RAIUtest, or an iodine uptake test.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3314Thyroid nuclear medicine scanPreparation\nCertain medications can interfere with iodine\nuptake. These include certain cough medicines, some\noral contraceptives , and thyroid medications. The\npatient is usually instructed to stop taking these medi-cines for a period of time before the test. This period mayrange from several days up to three to four weeks,depending on the amount of time the medicine takes toclear from the body.\nOther nuclear medicine scans and x ray studies using\ncontrast material performed within the past 60 days mayaffect this test. Therefore, patients should tell their doc-tors if they have had either of these types of studies beforethe thyroid scan is begun, to avoid inaccurate results.\nSome institutions prefer that the patient have noth-\ning to eat or drink after midnight on the day before theradioactive liquid or capsule is to be taken. A normal dietcan usually be resumed two hours after the radioisotopeis taken. Dentures, jewelry, and other metallic objectsmust be removed before the scanning is performed. Noother physical preparation is needed.\nThe patient should understand that there is no danger\nof radiation exposure to themselves or others. Only verysmall amounts of radioisotope are used. The total amountof radiation absorbed is often less than the dose receivedfrom ordinary x rays. The scanner or camera does not emitany radiation, but detects and records it from the patient.\nAftercare\nNo isolation or special precautions are needed after\na thyroid scan. The patient should check with his or herphysician about restarting any medications that werestopped before the scan.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this procedure.\nNormal results\nA normal scan will show a thyroid of normal size,\nshape, and position. The amount of radionuclide uptakeby the thyroid will be normal according to establishedlaboratory figures. There will be no areas where radionu-clide uptake is increased or decreased.\nAbnormal results\nAn area of increased radionuclide uptake may be\ncalled a hot nodule or “hot spot.” This means that abenign growth is overactive. Despite the name, hot nod-ules are unlikely to be caused by cancer .KEY TERMS\nRadioisotope —A radioactive or radiation-emitting\nform of an element.\nRadionuclide —A substance that emits radiation as\nit disintegrates.\nAn area of decreased radionuclide uptake may be\ncalled a cold nodule or “cold spot.” This indicates that thisarea of the thyroid gland is underactive. A variety of condi-tions, including cysts, nonfunctioning benign growths,localized inflammation, or cancer may produce a cold spot.\nA thyroid nuclear medicine scan is rarely sufficient\nto establish a clear diagnosis.

    "content": "Thyroid ultrasound\nDefinition\nThyroid ultrasound is an imaging technique used for\ndiagnosing suspected thyroid disease. It uses harmless,high-frequency sound waves to form an image. Thesound waves are reflected by thyroid tissue to form a pic-ture of internal structures. It is not invasive and involvesno radiation.\nPurpose\nThe thyroid gland is an organ located in front of the\nneck. It plays an important role in controlling the body’smetabolism. Most thyroid ultrasounds are performed toevaluate a small lump (nodule) in the thyroid found dur-ing a physical examination or found by a radionuclide\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3315Thyroid ultrasoundstudy (thyroid scan). The ultrasound can establish if the\nnodule is a cyst, which is an abnormal lump that containsfluid, or a solid mass. Cysts are almost always non-cancerous (benign), although in some cases the fluid maybe taken out for additional testing.\nIf there are several masses or nodules, this indicates\nthe presence of enlargement of the thyroid gland ( goiter ).\nIf there is only one mass, it may be cancerous and needsfurther evaluation. Specialized thyroid ultrasounds, suchas color Doppler flow studies, can add valuable informa-tion. By showing an image of the blood circulation in thegland, this study can assess some ambiguous masses ingreater detail, to further refine diagnosis. In some cases, aneedle will be inserted to remove some tissue from themass for evaluation in a laboratory (needle biopsy). Ultra-sound is used during this procedure to help the physicianguide the needle to the mass that needs to be evaluated.\nThyroid ultrasound can measure the size of the thy-\nroid with great precision. Ultrasound studies may bedone periodically to assess the response of the thyroidgland to medical therapy. An enlarged gland or a benignnodule should decrease in size when appropriate thyroidmedication is taken.\nPatients who have received therapeutic radiation to the\nhead or neck may be monitored at regular intervals usingthyroid ultrasound. The radiation puts these patients athigher risk for developing thyroid cancer or other abnor-\nmalities. In the early stages, these conditions may not causesymptoms or be apparent during a physical examination.They can, however, be detected by ultrasound.\nCertain invasive medical procedures may be per-\nformed under ultrasound guidance. This is because ultra-sound allows the physician to observe a needle as it entersbody tissue below the skin. This is useful to direct theremoval of fluid from a cyst (aspiration) or needle biopsy.Medications to treat recurrent cysts may be administereddirectly to the area using ultrasound guidance.\nPrecautions\nThyroid ultrasound is safe for people of all ages. It is\nthe preferred procedure to evaluate suspected disease inpregnant women because no radiation is involved.\nDescription\nThe study may be done in an outpatient facility or in\na hospital department. The patient lies on his or her back.A pillow or rolled towel is placed under the shouldersand upper back, allowing the head to tilt back (hyperex-tend). A gel that enhances sound transmission is spreadover the thyroid area. The technologist then gently placesa transducer, an instrument about the size of an electricshaver, against the skin. It is moved over the thyroid area.\nThe images from reflected sound waves appear on amonitor screen. There is no discomfort involved with thisstudy. The examination takes 15–30 minutes.\nPreparation\nSome facilities recommend limiting food and drink\nfor one hour before the study to prevent discomfort. Noother preparation is needed.\nAftercare\nNo special restrictions or procedures are needed\nafter a thyroid ultrasound.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this procedure.\nNormal results\nA normal study would reveal a thyroid gland of nor-\nmal size, shape, position, and uniform texture.\nAbnormal results\nA thyroid ultrasound may reveal cysts, solid masses\nthat may or may not be cancerous, or an enlarged thyroidgland (goiter).

    "title": "Thyroidectomy",
    "content": "Thyroidectomy\nDefinition\nThyroidectomy is a surgical procedure in which all\nor part of the thyroid gland is removed. The thyroidgland is located in the forward part of the neck (anterior)just under the skin and in front of the Adam’s apple.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3316ThyroidectomyPurpose\nAll or part of the thyroid gland may be removed to\ncorrect a variety of abnormalities of the gland. If thepatient has a goiter (an enlargement of the thyroid gland,\ncausing a swelling in the front of the neck), it may causedifficulties with swallowing or breathing. Hyperthy-\nroidism (over-functioning of the thyroid gland) produces\nhypermetabolism (abnormally increased use of oxygen,nutrients, and other materials). If medication cannot ade-quately treat this condition, or if the patient is a child orpregnant, the thyroid gland must be removed. Both can-cerous tumors and noncancerous tumors (frequentlycalled nodules) can occur and they must be removed, inaddition to some or all of the thyroid gland.\nPrecautions\nThere are definite risks associated with the proce-\ndure. Therefore, the thyroid gland should be removedonly if there is a pressing reason or medical conditionthat requires it.\nDescription\nThyroidectomy is an operative procedure done most\ncommonly by a general surgeon, or occasionally by anotolaryngologist, in the operating room of a hospital. Theoperation begins when an anesthesiologist puts thepatient to sleep. The anesthesiologist injects drugs intothe patient’s veins and then places an airway tube in thewindpipe to ventilate (provide air for) the patient. Thesurgeon makes an incision in the front of the neck wherea tight-fitting necklace would rest. He locates and takescare not to injure the parathyroid glands and the recurrentlaryngeal nerves, while freeing the thyroid gland fromthese surrounding structures. The blood supply to theportion of the thyroid gland that is to be removed isclamped off. Then all or part of the gland is removed. Ifcancer is present, all, or almost all, of the gland is\nremoved. If other diseases or a nodule is present, the sur-geon may remove only part of the gland. The totalamount of thyroid gland removed depends upon the thy-roid disease being treated. A drain (a soft plastic tube thatdrains fluid out of the area) may be placed before theincision is closed. The incision is closed either withsutures (stitches) or metal clips. A dressing is placed overthe incision and the drain, if one is used.\nPatients generally stay in the hospital one to four\ndays after completion of the operation. \nPreparation\nBefore a thyroidectomy is performed, a variety of\ntests and studies are usually required to determine thenature of the thyroid disease. Laboratory analysis of\nblood determines the levels of active thyroid hormonecirculating in the body. Sonograms and computed\ntomography scans (CT scans) help to determine the size\nof the thyroid gland and location of abnormalities. A thy-\nroid nuclear medicine scan assesses the function of the\ngland. A needle biopsy of an abnormality or aspiration(removal by suction) of fluid from the thyroid gland mayalso be done to help determine the diagnosis.\nIf the diagnosis is hyperthyroidism, the patient may\nbe asked to take antithyroid medication or iodides beforethe operation; or continued treatment with antithyroiddrugs may be the treatment of choice. Otherwise, noother special procedure must be followed prior to theoperation.\nAftercare\nThe incision requires little to no care after the dress-\ning is removed. The area may be bathed gently with amild soap. The sutures or the metal clips are removedthree to seven days after the operation.\nRisks\nAs with all operations, patients who are obese,\nsmoke, or have poor nutrition are at greater risk for devel-\noping complications related to the general anesthetic itself.\nHoarseness or voice loss may develop if the recur-\nrent laryngeal nerve was injured or destroyed during theoperation. This is more apt to occur in patients who havelarge goiters or cancerous tumors.\nHypoparathyroidism (under-functioning of the\nparathyroid glands) can occur if the parathyroid glandsare injured or removed at the time of the thyroidectomy.\nHypothyroidism (under-functioning of the thyroid\ngland) can occur if all or nearly all of the thyroid glandis removed. This may be intentional when the diagnosisis cancer. If the patient’s thyroid levels remain high, hemay be required to take thyroid replacement for the restof his life.\nThe neck and the area surrounding the thyroid gland\nhave a rich supply of blood vessels. Bleeding in the areaof the operation may occur and be difficult to control orstop. Rarely is a blood transfusion required, although a\nhematoma (collection of blood) may develop. If thisoccurs, it may be life-threatening. As the hematomaenlarges, it may obstruct the airway and cause the patientto stop breathing. If a hematoma does develop in theneck, it may require drainage to clear the airway.\nWound infections can occur. If they do, the incision\nis drained, and there are usually no serious consequences.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3317ThyroidectomyNormal results\nMost patients are discharged from the hospital one\nto four days after the procedure. Most resume their nor-mal activities two weeks after the operation.

It pro-\nduces, secretes, and stores thyroxine (T4), a hormone that\ninfluences the metabolism of just about every bodyprocess.\nWhen the thyroid gland is functioning properly, hor-\nmone release is carefully regulated. When bacteria orviruses invade and inflame the gland, T\n4surges into the\nbloodstream and raises hormone levels that then discour-age the gland from creating more T\n4. Eventually the hor-\nmone stores are exhausted, the thyroid loses its ability tomanufacture T\n4, and an underactive thyroid ( hypothy-\nroidism ) results. \nThe major cause of hypothyroidism, thyroiditis\naffects about 12 million people in the United States. Thiscondition is more common in women than in men andusually develops between ages 30–50.\nHashimoto’s disease\nThe most common type of thyroiditis is Hashimoto’s\ndisease, a painless disorder also known as:\n• autoimmune thyroiditis• chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis\n• lymphadenoid goiter\n• struma lymphomatosa\nHashimoto’s disease can develop at any age, but is\nmost common in middle-aged women. This immune sys-tem disorder runs in families, and affects about 5% ofadults in the United States.\nHashimoto’s disease slowly destroys thyroid tissue\nand robs the gland of its ability to change iodine into T\n4.\nThe condition progresses so gradually that many peoplewho have it do not realize anything is wrong until theenlarged gland forms a goiter, a swelling seen and felt inthe front of the neck. This may not happen until weeks oreven years after an individual develops Hashimoto’s. \nSubacute thyroiditis\nMuch less common than Hashimoto’s disease, suba-\ncute thyroiditis is a painful inflammation that developssuddenly in a patient who has had a viral infection, suchas mumps or an upper respiratory illness. Pain radiates\nthroughout the neck and patients feel ill and feverish. Itmay take as long as several months for normal thyroidfunction to resume. \nSubacute thyroiditis is also called:\n• DeQuervain’s thyroiditis• giant cell thyroiditis\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3318Thyroiditis• granulomatous thyroiditis\n• subacute granulomatous thyroiditis\nSilent thyroiditis\nThe least common of the three major types, silent\nthyroiditis is characterized by rigidity and slight enlarge-ment of the thyroid gland. Postpartum thyroiditis, a formof silent thyroiditis, develops in 5–9% of all women whohave recently given birth. Postpartum thyroiditis devel-ops within a year of the baby’s birth and disappears with-in six months.\nAcute thyroiditis\nCaused by acute infection, this rare disease is a med-\nical emergency. A patient who has acute thyroiditis has ahigh fever and feels very ill. The neck is red, hot, and\nvery tender.\nCauses and symptoms\nHashimoto’s disease\nHashimoto’s disease develops when the immune\nsystem attacks the thyroid gland. It may be related tosuch hormone-related (endocrine system) disorders as:\n• Addison’s disease. This condition, caused by malfunction\nof the adrenal gland, is characterized by weakness, loss ofweight and appetite, and increased sensitivity to cold.\n• Diabetes mellitus. This metabolic disorder is caused by\na lack of insulin production or by the body’s inability toprocess insulin.\n• Graves’ disease. This disease is the most common form\nof hyperthyroidism .\n• Vitiligo. This is a noncancerous skin disease character-\nized by unpigmented patches of skin. \nBeing female and having a family history of\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis increases the likelihood of devel-oping the disease. Its symptoms include:\n• constipation \n• fatigue• goiter or enlarged neck• inability to tolerate cold temperatures\n• weight gain, some patients’ faces swell and their joints\nstiffen.\nSubacute thyroiditis\nCharacterized by painful gland enlargement that is\nsometimes mistaken for a sore throat that may last for\nmonths, subacute thyroiditis often follows:• influenza\n• mumps\n• upper respiratory infections\n• viruses that produce cold symptoms and inflammation\nof the membrane that protects the brain ( meningitis ),\ninflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart ( peri-\ncarditis ), inflammation of the heart muscle ( myocardi-\ntis), and other diseases\nPeople who have subacute thyroiditis feel feverish,\nweak, and tired. The thyroid is sore to the touch. Theymay be nervous, sweat, and have trouble tolerating heator swallowing. Symptoms of subacute thyroiditis alsoinclude:\n• rapid heartbeat• tremors\n• weight loss\nSilent thyroiditis\nThe cause of silent thyroiditis is uncertain, but the\ncondition is believed to be an immune-system disordertriggered by childbirth . Although silent thyroiditis is\npainless, the condition’s other symptoms are similar tothose of subacute thyroiditis. The thyroid gland enlargesonly slightly, and the eyes do not bulge.\nDiagnosis\nFamily physicians and endocrinologists usually base\na diagnosis of thyroiditis on:\n• blood levels of thyroid hormones , thyroid-stimulating\nhormone, and anti-thyroid antibodies\n• personal and family medical history\n• the appearance of a patient’s thyroid gland\nThyroid antibodies present in 95% of patients with\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis make it possible to diagnose thisdisease without surgery or biopsy. A blood test that mea-sures sedimentation rate, an indication of the extent ofinflammation, is a useful tool for diagnosing subacutethyroiditis.\nTreatment\nMedical therapy for thyroiditis includes:\n•antibiotics to fight infection\n• high doses of aspirin to relieve inflammation\n• hormones to suppress or replace thyroid function\n• pain medications\nCortisone drugs are sometimes prescribed to reduce\npersistent inflammation. In rare instances, surgery can be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3319Thyroiditisused to drain infection or relieve pressure near the thy-\nroid gland.\nHashimoto’s disease\nThe goal of treatment for Hashimoto’s disease is to\nprevent the thyroid gland from getting larger. Regularmonitoring may be the only treatment indicated forpatients whose gland is only slightly enlarged, and whoshow no signs of hormone deficiency. Levothyroxine(Synthroid) may be prescribed to correct hormone defi-ciency in a patient who has a large goiter.\nSubacute thyroiditis\nThe goal of treatment for subacute thyroiditis is to\nrelieve pain, reduce inflammation, and regulate hyper-thyroidism. Bed rest and beta blockers (propranolol,\nnadolol) may be necessary until thyroid activity is con-trolled, and the patient may have to take:\n• anti-inflammatory medication for several weeks• high doses of aspirin• other analgesics\nIf subacute thyroiditis continues for a long time, corti-\nsone and thyroid hormone medication may be prescribedto relieve inflammation and allow the gland to rest. Gluco-corticoids (prednisone) are prescribed for symptoms thatdo not respond to other treatment. The original problemoften becomes more pronounced after these medicationsare discontinued.\nSilent thyroiditis\nMost patients who have silent thyroiditis don’t need\nany treatment, but:\n• bed rest and beta blockers are occasionally needed to\nregulate rapid heart beat\n• inderal (propanolol) may be prescribed for brief periods\nof hyperthyroidism\n• steroids may be prescribed for severe episodes of acute\ninflammation\nAcute thyroiditis\nAcute thyroiditis requires emergency treatment with\nantibiotics and surgery.\nPrognosis\nThyroiditis usually responds to treatment, and some\npatients recover normal thyroid function without treat-ment. Because permanent loss of thyroid function is apossibility and life-long thyroid replacement therapymay be necessary, regular medical monitoring should\ncontinue even after the patient has apparently recovered.\nHashimoto’s disease\nSome cases of Hashimoto’s disease remain stable\nfor years. Others slowly progress to hypothyroidism,which is treated with thyroid hormone replacement\ntherapy .\nSubacute thyroiditis\nMost patients with subacute thyroiditis recover fully\nafter no more than a few months. This condition occa-sionally recurs, but severe or long-term complicationsare rare.\nSilent thyroiditis\nFour of every five patients with silent thyroiditis\nrecover completely within three months. The thyroid sta-tus of these patients should be evaluated within 12months. Because silent thyroiditis recurs in 10% ofpatients within three years and may progress to hypothy-roidism, medical monitoring should continue for threeyears after recovery appears complete.\nPrevention\nFlu shots or immunizations for measles , mumps,\nand rubella may help prevent conditions associated with\nsubacute thyroiditis. There is no known way to preventother forms of thyroiditis.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nThe Thyroid Foundation of America. 350 Ruth Sleeper Hall,\nParkman St., Boston, MA 02114.

    "content": "Tilt table test\nDefinition\nThe tilt table test is a test in which a patient is posi-\ntioned in a supine position and brought to a predeter-mined angle or angles from the horizontal position. Suchpositioning helps to determine the cause of any decreasein oxygen to the brain. Different types of drugs may alsoused in the testing process.KEY TERMS\nAddison’s disease —A disease that results from a\ndeficiency in adrenocortical hormones.\nDiabetes mellitus —A disorder of the pancreas.\nThis chronic disorder of carbohydrate metabolismresults in hyperglycemia and glycosuria. \nGoiter —An abnormal enlargement of the thryroid\ngland.\nGraves’ disease —Also called hyperthyroidism, this\ndisease results from overactivity of the thyroidgland.\nSubacute —An abnormal condition present in a\nperson who appears to be clinically well.\nVitiligo —A benign skin disease that results in\nirregular patches of skin that are totally lacking incolor.Purpose\nThe purpose of the tilt table test is to help determine\nappropriate therapy for individuals with fainting (syn-\ncope) and presyncope of unexplained origin.\nPrecautions\nPrecautions are few with the tilt table test. However,\nwhen any drug is used with this test, the appropriate pre-cautions for that particular drug should be observed. Forexample, when isoproterenol or similiar drugs are usedduring the tilt table test, the taking of non-prescriptiondrugs for asthma ,cough , cold, or allergy; appetite sup-\npressants; sleeping pills; or drugs containing caffeine\nshould be made known to the physician prior to the test.Likewise, the physician should be informed of any aller-\ngies to any sympathomimetic drugs, including several of\nthe diet pills on the market. The physician should be toldof any serious heart-rhythm disorders.\nDescription\nSyncope is described as a pathological brief loss of\nconsciousness caused by a temporary deficiency of oxy-gen in the brain. Previous studies have shown the effec-tiveness of tilt table testing in establishing the diagnosisof neurocardiogenic syncope, and in dictating therapy inpatients with syncope of unknown origin. Despite its use-fulness, small numbers of patients and brief followupreports have limited the majority of studies. Sensitivity-enhancing techniques, such as the administration of iso-proterenol, are applied in specific cases to children andyoung adults to compensate for the otherwise low sensi-tivity (20-30%) observed in that population.\nPreparation\nIn order for a patient to make informed decisions\nabout any diagnostic test or procedure, there are impor-tant questions that need to be asked prior to the procedure.The information gained will be helpful for that patient indetermining benefits, risks, and cost of the procedure, andalternatives. The patient should understand the purpose ofthe tilt table test, and the diagnosis that the physician istrying to confirm or rule out. If the tilt table test is posi-tive, the patient should ask questions about the frequencyof false-positive results for that particular tilt table proce-dure, and should inquire about the next step in treatment.\nAftercare\nAfter the procedure, the patient is asked to transfer\nfrom the supine position to a sitting position, and isobserved for a short period of time. During this time and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3321Tilt table testafter several minutes in the sitting position, any symp-\ntoms of dizziness and vertigo are noted. When ready, the\nindividual transfers from the sitting position to standing.After additional observation and taking of vital signs, theindividual is allowed to go home.\nRisks\nRisks of the tilt table test are low, but do include sig-\nnificant changes in blood pressure while in the supineposition, and any adverse reactions to any drugs adminis-tered during the tilt table test.\nNormal results\nNormal results of the tilt table test should help the\nphysician in assessing what may or may not be the causeof the syncope. \nAbnormal results\nAbnormal results include any pathologic reactions to\nthe position changes or sensitivity enhancing techniques,such as the administration of isoproterenol or other relat-ed drugs. \nResources\nPERIODICALS\nTonnessen, G.

    "title": "Tinnitus",
    "content": "Tinnitus\nDefinition\nTinnitus is hearing ringing, buzzing, or other sounds\nwithout an external cause. Patients may experience tinni-tus in one or both ears or in the head. \nDescription\nTinnitus affects as many as 40 million adults in the\nUnited States. It is defined as either objective or subjec-tive. In objective tinnitus, the doctor can hear the sounds,as well as the patient. Objective tinnitus is typicallycaused by tumors, turbulent blood flow through mal-formed vessels, or by rhythmic muscular spasms. Mostcases of tinnitus are subjective, which means that onlythe patient can hear the sounds. \nCauses and symptoms\nSubjective tinnitus is frequently associated with\nhearing loss . About 90% of patients have sensorineural\nhearing loss; 5% suffer from conductive hearing loss; 5%have normal hearing. The causes of subjective tinnitusinclude:\n• impacted ear wax\n• ear infections\n• hardening of the structures of the inner ear\n• hearing loss related to age or excessive noise\n• ototoxic medications, including aspirin , quinine, some\ndiuretics , heavy metals, alcohol, and certain antibiotics\n• meniere’s syndrome\n• head trauma\n• systemic diseases, including syphilis ,hypertension ,\nanemia, or hypothyroidism\n• tumors of the ear\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3322TinnitusDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of tinnitus includes a physical examina-\ntion of the patient’s head and neck. The doctor will use\nan otoscope to examine the ears for wax, infection, orstructural changes. He or she will also use a stethoscopeto listen to the blood vessels in the neck. Additional testsmay include the following:\nTuning fork tests\nThe Rinne and Weber tests are commonly used to\nevaluate the type and severity of hearing loss. In theWeber test, the doctor holds a tuning fork against thepatient’s forehead or front teeth. If the hearing loss issensorineural, the sound radiates to the ear with betterhearing; if the hearing loss is conductive, the sound willbe louder in the damaged ear. In the Rinne test, the tun-ing fork is placed alternately on the mastoid bone(behind the ear) and in front of the ear. In conductivehearing loss, bone conduction (BC) is greater than airconduction (AC). In sensorineural hearing loss, AC isgreater than BC.\nDiagnostic imaging\nMagnetic resonance angiography or venography\n(MRA and MRV) can be used to evaluate malformationsof the blood vessels. Computed tomography scans (CT\nscans) or magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs)\ncan be used to locate tumors or abnormalities of the brainstem.\nBlood tests\nThe doctor may order a complete blood count\n(CBC) with specific antibody tests to rule out syphilis orimmune system disorders.\nTreatment\nSome cases of tinnitus can be treated by removal of\nthe underlying cause. These include surgical treatment ofimpacted ear wax, tumors, head injuries, or malformedblood vessels; discontinuance of ototoxic medications;and antibiotic treatment of infections.\nSubjective tinnitus, especially that associated with\nage-related hearing loss, can be treated with hearing\naids, noise generators or other masking devices, biofeed-\nback , antidepressant medications, or lifestyle modifica-\ntions (elimination of smoking , coffee, and aspirin).\nAlternative treatment\nA variety of alternative therapies may be helpful in\nthe treatment of tinnitus. Dietary adjustments, includingKEY TERMS\nConductive hearing loss —Hearing loss caused by\nloss of function in the external or middle ear.\nMénière’s syndrome —A disease of the inner ear,\nmarked by recurrent episodes of loss of balance(vertigo) and roaring in the ears lasting severalhours. Its cause is unknown.\nOtotoxic —Damaging to the nerves controlling the\nsenses of hearing and balance.\nSensorineural hearing loss —Hearing loss caused\nby damage to the nerves or parts of the inner eargoverning the sense of hearing. \nthe elimination of coffee and other stimulants, may be\nuseful, since stimulants can make tinnitus worse. In addi-tion, reducing the amount of fat and cholesterol in the dietcan help improve blood circulation to the ears. Nutritionalsupplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, B vitamins ,\ncalcium, magnesium, potassium, and essential fatty acidsis also recommended. Gingko ( Gingko biloba ) is often\nsuggested, since it is believed to enhance circulation tothe brain. Acupuncture treatments may help decrease the\nlevel of tinnitus sounds the patient hears, and constitu-tional homeopathic treatment may also be effective.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the cause of the tinnitus\nand the patient’s emotional response. Most patients withsubjective tinnitus do not find it seriously disturbing, butabout 5% have strong negative feelings. These patients arefrequently helped by instruction in relaxation techniques.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHouse, John W. “Tinnitus.” In Conn’s Current Therapy, 1996 ,\ned. Robert E. Rakel. Philadelphia: W. B.

    "title": "Tissue typing",
    "content": "Tissue typing\nDefinition\nTissue typing is a group of procedures that deter-\nmines the type of histocompatibility antigens on a per-son’s cells or tissues. This procedure is typically usedprior to transplantation of tissues or organs.\nPurpose\nTissue typing is done prior to transplantation to\nensure as close a match as possible between the donorand the recipient. If the histocompatibility antigens donot match well, there is a much greater chance that therecipient will reject the donated tissue.\nHistocompatibility antigens are molecules on the\nsurface of all cells in the body. The specific types of his-tocompatibility antigens present on a person’s cellsdetermine their identity and distinguish each person.They are a “fingerprint.”\nEach person has a unique set of histocompatibility\nantigens. If the antigens on tissue or organs from a donordo not match that of the recipient, a rejection responsecan occur. The recipient’s immune system will detect thedifference between the two sets of antigen and start arejection response to kill the donated tissue. Except inthe case of identical twins, no two people are identical interms of their histocompatibility antigen types. However,the closer two tissues come to matching, the more likelythe recipient will accept the donated tissue or organ.\nHuman Lymphocyte Antigens (HLA) is the name\ngiven to the most commonly used histocompatibility anti-gens. The antigens can be grouped into two classes: class Iantigens are found on almost all cells, and class II antigensare normally found only on B lymphocytes, macrophages,monocytes, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells.\nDescription\nGenerally, typing is performed on blood cells\nbecause they are an easy sample to obtain. Blood iswithdrawn from a vein in the forearm, and the cells areseparated. There are a number of different techniquesused to identify the antigens on the cells. Typically, spe-cific antibodies react with the cells. Each antibodyKEY TERMS\nAntibody —A molecule produced by the body that\nis part of the immune response to attack antigens.\nAntigen —A molecule that causes the body to pro-\nduce an immunological response to attack theantigen.\nCornea —The transparent outer layer of the eye. It\ncovers the iris and lens.\nLymphocyte —A class of white blood cells that are\nresponsible for creating the immune response toantigens.\npreparation is specific for one histocompatibility anti-\ngen. If the antigen is present, the antibody will bind to it.Laboratory instruments are used to detect antibody bind-ing to the cells. Class II antigens are determined by themixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) or by a polymerasechain reaction (PCR). In the mixed lymphocyte reaction,lymphocyte replication occurs if there is a mismatch,and is detected by a specific assay. The PCR test is anew DNA-based test that can detect the presence orabsence of antigens by determining whether cells havethe genes for the antigens.\nOne type of transplant does not require tissue typing.\nIn the case of corneal transplants, tissue typing is notneeded because corneas do not have their own blood sup-ply. This greatly reduces the chance that immune cellswill come in contact with the cornea and recognize it asforeign. For this reason, corneas can be transplantedfrom any person, and there is little chance of rejection.\nNormal results\nBecause each person has their own histocompatibili-\nty antigen “fingerprint,” there is no true normal result.Each fingerprint is unique. \nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

These operations areoften performed together and are usually done on chil-dren. T & As are the most common childhood operations. \nPurpose\nTonsillectomy\nTonsils are removed (with or without the adenoids)\nwhen the child has any of the following conditions:\n• obstruction of the upper airway.\n• sleep apnea. This is a condition in which the child\nsnores loudly and stops breathing temporarily at inter-vals during sleep.\n• inability to swallow properly because of enlarged tonsils.• “hot potato” voice (breathy voice) and other speech\nabnormalities due to enlarged tonsils\n• recurrent or persistent abscesses or throat infections\nDoctors do not agree completely on the number of\nsore throats that make a tonsillectomy necessary. Mostwould agree that four cases of strep throat in any one\nyear; six or more episodes of tonsillitis in one year; or\nfive or more episodes of tonsillitis per year for two yearsindicate that the tonsils should be removed.\nAdenoidectomy\nAdenoids are removed (with or without the tonsils)\nwhen the child has any of the following conditions:\n• alteration of facial growth because of enlarged adenoidsKEY TERMS\nAbscess —A localized area of tissue destruction\nand pus formation. \nAdenoids —Masses of lymphoid tissue that are\nfound in the upper throat.\nSleep apnea —A condition marked by loud snoring\nduring sleep and periodic episodes of suspendedbreathing.\nTonsils —Oval masses of lymphoid tissue on each\nside of the throat.\n• upper airway obstruction\n• development of an irregular bite (dental malocclusion)\n• difficult speech or swallowing\nPrecautions\nT & As are not performed as frequently today as\nthey were in the past. One reason for a more conservativeapproach is that there is always some risk involved whena patient is put under general anesthesia.\nIn some cases, a T & A may need to be modified or\npostponed:\n• children with cleft palates should not have the adenoids\nremoved\n• bleeding disorders; these must be brought under control\nbefore surgery\n• acute tonsillitis; surgery should be postponed—usually\nfor three to four weeks—until the infection is gone\nDescription\nTonsillectomies are hospital procedures. In adults,\nthey may be performed under local anesthesia. Childrenare usually placed under general anesthesia. The doctordepresses the tongue in order to see the throat andremoves the tonsils with a scooplike instrument. Theadenoids are usually removed through the nose. \nAftercare\nPatients are turned on the side after the operation to\nprevent the possibility of blood being drawn into thelungs. The patient’s vital signs are checked. After thepatient is fully awake, he or she can drink water andother nonirritating liquids.\nAdult patients are usually warned to expect some\nbleeding after the operation and a very sore throat .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3325Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomyAntibiotics are given to prevent infection. Medications\nto relieve pain may also be given. For at least the first 24\nhours, the patient is fed soft or pureed foods and fluids. Ifthe adenoids alone were removed, the patient may beallowed solid food the day after surgery.\nPatients are usually sent home the next day, with\ninstructions to call the doctor if there is bleeding, an ear-ache, or a fever that lasts longer than three days. They\nare told to expect a white scab to form in the throatbetween five and 10 days after surgery. \nRisks\nAbout one in every fifteen thousand tonsillectomies\nends in death , either from the anesthesia or from bleed-\ning to death five to seven days after the operation. Thereis also a chance that children with previously normalspeech will develop a nasal-sounding voice. In addition,children younger than five years may be badly emotion-ally upset by the hospital experience.\nNormal results\nNormal results include the correction of the condi-\ntion for which the surgery was performed.Resources\nBOOKS\nBerman, Stephen, and Ken Chan. “Ear, Nose, & Throat.” In\nCurrent Pediatric Diagnosis & Treatment , ed.

Both operations are typicallyperformed on children.The illustration above shows a tonsillectomy in progress. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)the body through the mouth and sinuses. The tonsils also\nstimulate the immune system to produce antibodies tohelp fight off infections. Anyone of any age can have ton-sillitis; however, it is most common in children betweenthe ages of five and 10 years.\nCauses and symptoms\nTonsillitis is caused by viruses or bacteria that cause\nthe tonsils to swell and become inflamed. A mild orsevere sore throat is one of the first symptoms of tonsil-\nlitis. Symptoms can also include fever , chills, tiredness,\nmuscle aches, earache, pain or discomfort when swal-\nlowing, and swollen glands in the neck. Very young chil-dren may be fussy and stop eating. When a doctor ornurse looks into the mouth with a flashlight, the tonsilsmay appear swollen and red. Sometimes, the tonsils willhave white or yellow spots or flecks or a thin coating.Symptoms usually last four to six days.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of tonsillitis is made from the visible\nsymptoms and a physical examination of the patient.\nThe doctor will examine the eyes, ears, nose, and throat,looking at the tonsils for signs of swelling, redness, or adischarge. A careful examination of the throat is neces-\nsary to rule out diphtheria and other conditions that may\ncause a sore throat. Since most sore throats in childrenare caused by viruses rather than bacteria, the doctor maytake a throat culture in order to test for the presence of\nstreptococcal bacteria. A throat culture is performed bywiping a cotton swab across the tonsils and back of thethroat, and sending the swab to a laboratory for culturing.Streptococcus pyogenes , the bacterium that causes strep\nthroat , is the most common disease agent responsible\nfor tonsillitis. Depending on what type of test is used forstrep, the doctor may be able to determine within a fewminutes if S. pyogenes is present. The quick tests for\nstrep are not as reliable as a laboratory culture, which cantake 24–48 hours. If the results of a quick test are posi-tive, however, the doctor can prescribe antibiotics right\naway. If the quick test results are negative, the doctor cando a throat culture to verify the results and wait for thelaboratory report before prescribing antibiotics. A bloodtest may also be done to rule out a more serious infectionor condition, and to check the white blood cell count tosee if the body is responding to the infection. In somecases, the doctor may order blood tests for mononucleo-sis, since about a third of patients with mononucleosisdevelop streptococcal infections of the tonsils.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3327Tonsillitis\nTongueNasal cavityPharyngeal\ntonsilPalatine tonsil\nLingual tonsil\nPalatine tonsil\nLingual tonsil\nThe palatine, lingual, and pharyngeal tonsils. (Illustration by Hans & Cassady, Inc.)Treatment\nTreatment of tonsillitis usually involves keeping the\npatient comfortable while the illness runs its course. Thissupportive care includes bed rest, drinking extra fluids,gargling with warm salt water, and taking pain reliev-ers—usually NSAIDs—to reduce fever. Frozen juicebars and cold fruit drinks can bring some temporaryrelief of sore throat pain; drinking warm tea or broth canbe soothing. If the throat culture shows that S. pyogenes\nis present, penicillin or other antibiotics will be pre-scribed. An injection of benzathine or procaine penicillinmay be most effective in treating the infection, but it isalso painful. If an oral antibiotic is prescribed, it must betaken for the full course of treatment, usually 10-14 days.If the patient has several episodes of severe tonsillitis, thedoctor may recommend a tonsillectomy, which is the sur-gical removal of the tonsils.\nAlternative treatment\nStrengthening the immune system is important\nwhether tonsillitis is caused by bacteria or viruses.Naturopaths often recommend dietary supplements ofvitamin C, bioflavonoids, and beta-carotenes—foundnaturally in fruits and vegetables—to ease inflamma-tion and fight infection. A variety of herbal remediesalso may be helpful in treating tonsillitis. Calendula(Calendula officinalis ) and cleavers ( Galium aparine )\ntarget the lymphatic system, while echinacea (Echi-\nnacea spp.) and astragalus ( Astragalus\nmembranaceus ) stimulate the immune system. Gold-\nenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), myrrh ( Commiphora\nmolmol ), and bitter orange act as antibacterials.\nLomatium dissectum and Ligusticum porteri have an\nantiviral action. Some of the homeopathic medicinesthat may be used to treat symptoms of tonsillitisinclude Belladonna ,Phytolacca ,Mercurius ,Lycopodium ,Lachesis ,Hepar sulphuris ,Arsenicum ,\nor Rhus toxicodendron . As with any condition, the\ntreatment and dosage should be appropriate for theparticular symptoms and age of the patient.\nPrognosis\nTonsillitis usually resolves within a few days with\nrest and supportive care. Treating the symptoms of sorethroat and fever will make the patient more comfortable.If fever persists for more than 48 hours, however, or ishigher than 102°F, the patient should be seen by a doctor.If antibiotics are prescribed to treat an infection, theyshould be taken as directed for the complete course oftreatment, even if the patient starts to feel better in a fewdays. Prolonged symptoms may indicate that the patienthas other upper respiratory infections, most commonly inthe ears or sinuses. An abscess behind the tonsil (a peri-\ntonsillar abscess) may also occur. In rare cases, a persis-tent sore throat may point to more serious conditions,such as rheumatic fever or pneumonia .\nPrevention\nThe bacteria and viruses that cause tonsillitis are\neasily spread from person to person. It is not unusual foran entire family or several students in the same class-room to come down with similar symptoms, especially ifS. pyogenes is the cause. The risk of transmission can be\nlowered by avoiding exposure to anyone who already hastonsillitis or a sore throat. Drinking glasses and eatingutensils should not be shared and should be washed inhot, soapy water before reuse. Old toothbrushes shouldbe replaced to prevent reinfection. People who are caringfor someone with tonsillitis should wash their hands fre-quently, to prevent spreading the infection to others. \nResources\nBOOKS\n“Ear, Nose, and Throat Disorders: Tonsillitis.” In Diseases ,e d .\nMargaret Eckman and Nancy Priff.

    "title": "Tooth decay",
    "content": "Tooth decay\nDefinition\nTooth decay, which is also called dental cavities or\ndental caries, is the destruction of the outer surface(enamel) of a tooth. Decay results from the action of bac-teria that live in plaque, which is a sticky, whitish filmformed by a protein in saliva (mucin) and sugary sub-stances in the mouth. The plaque bacteria sticking totooth enamel use the sugar and starch from food particlesin the mouth to produce acid.\nDescription\nTooth decay is a common health problem, second in\nprevalence only to the common cold . It has been esti-\nmated that 90% of people in the United States have atleast one cavity and that 75% of people had their firstcavity by the age of five. Although anyone can have aproblem with tooth decay, children and senior citizensare the two groups at highest risk. Other high-risk groupsinclude people who eat a lot of starchy and sugary foods;people living in areas without a fluoridated water supply;and people who already have numerous dental restora-tions (fillings and crowns).KEY TERMS\nStreptococcus pyogenes —A common bacterium\nthat causes strep throat and can also cause tonsillitis.\nTonsillectomy —A surgical procedure to remove\nthe tonsils if the patient has recurrent sore throatsor throat infections, or if the tonsils have becomeso swollen that the patient has trouble breathing orswallowing. \nTonsils —Oval-shaped masses of glandular tissue\nlocated on both sides at the back of the throat.Tonsils act like filters to trap bacteria and viruses.Baby bottle tooth decay\nBaby bottle tooth decay is a dental problem that fre-\nquently develops in infants that are put to bed with a bot-tle containing a sweet liquid. Baby bottle tooth decay isalso called nursing-bottle caries and bottle-mouth syn-drome. Bottles containing such liquids as milk, formula,fruit juices, sweetened drink mixes, and sugar water con-tinuously bathe an infant’s mouth with sugar during napsor at night. The bacteria in the mouth use this sugar toproduce acid that destroys the child’s teeth. The upperfront teeth are typically the ones most severely damaged;the lower front teeth receive some protection from thetongue. Pacifiers dipped in sugar, honey, corn syrup, orother sweetened liquid also contribute to bottle-mouthsyndrome. The first signs of damage are chalky whitespots or lines across the teeth. As decay progresses, thedamage to the child’s teeth becomes obvious.\nCauses and symptoms\nTooth decay requires the simultaneous presence of\nthree factors: plaque bacteria, sugar, and a vulnerabletooth surface. Although several microorganisms found inthe mouth can cause tooth decay, the primary diseaseagent appears to be Streptococcus mutans . The sugars\nused by the bacteria are simple sugars such as glucose,sucrose, and lactose. They are converted primarily intolactic acid. When this acid builds up on an unprotectedtooth surface, it dissolves the minerals in the enamel, cre-\nating holes and weak spots (cavities). As the decay spreadsinward into the middle layer (the dentin), the toothbecomes more sensitive to temperature and touch. Whenthe decay reaches the center of the tooth (the pulp), theresulting inflammation (pulpitis) produces a toothache .\nDiagnosis\nTooth decay develops at varying rates. It may be\nfound during a routine six-month dental checkup beforethe patient is even aware of a problem. In other cases, thepatient may experience common early symptoms, suchas sensitivity to hot and cold liquids or localized discom-fort after eating very sweet foods. The dentist or dentalhygienist may suspect tooth decay if a dark spot or a pitis seen during a visual examination. Front teeth may beinspected for decay by shining a light from behind thetooth. This method is called transillumination. Areas ofdecay, especially between the teeth, will appear asnoticeable shadows when teeth are transilluminated. Xrays may be taken to confirm the presence and extent ofthe decay. The dentist then makes the final clinical diag-nosis by probing the enamel with a sharp instrument.\nTooth decay in pits and fissures may be differentiat-\ned from dark shadows in the crevices of the chewing sur-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3329Tooth decayfaces by a dye that selectively stains parts of the tooth\nthat have lost mineral content. A dentist can also use thisdye to tell whether all tooth decay has been removedfrom a cavity before placing a filling.\nDiagnosis in children\nDamage caused by baby bottle tooth decay is often\nnot diagnosed until the child has a severe problem,because parents seldom bring infants and toddlers in fordental check-ups. Dentists want to initially examine pri-mary teeth between 12 and 24 months. Children stilldrinking from a bottle anytime after their first birthdayare likely to have tooth decay.\nTreatment\nTo treat most cases of tooth decay in adults, the den-\ntist removes all decayed tooth structure, shapes the sidesof the cavity, and fills the cavity with an appropriatematerial, such as silver amalgam or composite resin. Thefilling is put in to restore and protect the tooth. If decayhas attacked the pulp, the dentist or a specialist called anendodontist may perform root canal treatment and\ncover the tooth with a crown.\nIn cases of baby bottle tooth decay, the dentist must\nassess the extent of the damage before deciding on thetreatment method. If the problem is caught early, the\nteeth involved can be treated with fluoride, followed bychanges in the infant’s feeding habits and better oral\nhygiene . Primary teeth with obvious decay in the enam-\nel that has not yet progressed to the pulp need to be pro-tected with stainless steel crowns. Fillings are not usu-ally an option in small children because of the smallsize of their teeth and the concern of recurrent decay.When the decay has advanced to the pulp, pulling thetooth is often the treatment of choice. Unfortunately,loss of primary teeth at this age may hinder the youngchild’s ability to eat and speak. It may also have badeffects on the alignment and spacing of the permanentteeth when they come in.\nPrognosis\nWith timely diagnosis and treatment, the progres-\nsion of tooth decay can be stopped without extendedpain . If the pulp of the tooth is infected, the infection\nmay be treated with antibiotics prior to root canal treat-\nment or extraction. The longer decay goes untreated,however, the more destructive it becomes and thelonger and more intensive the necessary treatment willbe. In addition, a patient with two or more areas oftooth decay is at increased risk of developing additionalcavities in the future.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3330Tooth decay\nNormal tooth Tooth with cavityCavity\nGingivaNerve\nBonePulpGum\nPeriodontal\nmembrane\nTooth decay is the destruction of the outer surface, or enamel, of a tooth. It is caused by acid buildup from plaque bacteria,\nwhich dissolves the minerals in the enamel and creates cavities. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Prevention\nIt is easier and less expensive to prevent tooth decay\nthan to treat it. The four major prevention strategies include:proper oral hygiene; fluoride; sealants; and attention to diet.\nOral hygiene\nGENERAL CARE OF THE MOUTH. The best way to\nprevent tooth decay is to brush the teeth at least twice aday, preferably after every meal and snack, and flossdaily. Cavities develop most easily in spaces that are hardto clean. These areas include surface grooves, spacesbetween teeth, and the area below the gum line. Effectivebrushing cleans each outer tooth surface, inner tooth sur-face, and the horizontal chewing surfaces of the backteeth, as well as the tongue. Flossing once a day alsohelps prevent gum disease by removing food particlesand plaque at and below the gum line, as well as betweenteeth. Patients should visit their dentist every six monthsfor oral examination and professional cleaning.\nMOUTH CARE IN OLDER ADULTS. Older adults who\nhave lost teeth or had them removed still need to main-tain a clean mouth. Bridges and dentures must be keptclean to prevent gum disease. Dentures should be relinedand adjusted by a dentist whenever necessary to maintainproper fit. These adjustments help to keep the gums frombecoming red, swollen, and tender.\nMOUTH CARE IN CHILDREN. Parents can easily prevent\nbaby bottle tooth decay by not allowing a child to fall asleepwith a bottle containing sweetened liquids. Bottles should befilled only with plain, unsweetened water. The child shouldbe introduced to drinking from a cup around six months ofage and weaned from bottles by twelve months. If an infantseems to need oral comfort between feedings, a pacifier spe-cially designed for the mouth may be used. Pacifiers, howev-er, should never be dipped in honey, corn syrup, or othersweet liquids. After the eruption of the first tooth, parentsshould begin routinely wiping the infant’s teeth and gumswith a moist piece of gauze or a soft cloth, especially rightbefore bedtime. Parents may begin brushing a child’s teethwith a small, soft toothbrush at about two years of age,when most of the primary teeth have come in. They shouldapply only a very small amount (the size of a pea) of tooth-paste containing fluoride. Too much fluoride may causespotting (fluorosis) of the tooth enamel. As the child grows,he or she will learn to handle the toothbrush, but parentsshould control the application of toothpaste and do the fol-lowup brushing until the child is about seven years old.\nFluoride application\nFluoride is a natural substance that slows the\ndestruction of enamel and helps to repair minor toothdecay damage by remineralizing tooth structure. Tooth-\npaste, mouthwash, fluoridated public drinking water, andvitamin supplements are all possible sources of fluoride.Children living in areas without fluoridated water shouldreceive 0.5 mg/day of fluoride (0.25 mg/day if using atoothpaste containing fluoride) from three to five years ofage, and 1 mg/day from six to 12 years.\nWhile fluoride is important for protecting children’s\ndeveloping teeth, it is also of benefit to older adults withreceding gums. It helps to protect their newly exposedtooth surfaces from decay. Older adults can be treated bya dentist with a fluoride solution that is painted ontoselected portions of the teeth or poured into a fitted trayand held against all the teeth.\nSealants\nBecause fluoride is most beneficial on the smooth sur-\nfaces of teeth, sealants were developed to protect the irreg-ular surfaces of teeth. A sealant is a thin plastic coating thatis painted over the grooves of chewing surfaces to preventfood and plaque from being trapped there. Sealant treat-ment is painless because no part of the tooth is removed,although the tooth surface is etched with acid so that theplastic will adhere to the rough surface. Sealants are usual-ly clear or tooth-colored, making them less noticeable thansilver fillings. They cost less than fillings and can last up to10 years, although they should be checked for wear atevery dental visit. Children should get sealants on their firstpermanent “6-year” molars, which come in between theages of five and seven, and on the second permanent “12-year” molars, which come in between the ages of 11 and14. Sealants should be applied to the teeth shortly after theyerupt, before decay can set in. Although sealants have beenused in the United States for about 25 years, one survey bythe National Institute of Dental Research reported thatfewer than 8% of American children have them.\nDiet\nThe risk of tooth decay can be lowered by choosing\nfoods wisely and eating less often. Foods high in sugarand starch, especially when eaten between meals,increase the risk of cavities. The bacteria in the mouthuse sugar and starch to produce the acid that destroys theenamel. The damage increases with more frequent eatingand longer periods of eating. For better dental health,people should eat a variety of foods, limit the number ofsnacks, avoid sticky and overly sweetened foods, andbrush often after eating.\nDrinking water is also beneficial for rinsing food\nparticles from the mouth. Children can be taught to“swish and swallow” if they are unable to brush afterlunch at school. Similarly, saliva stimulated during eating\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3331Tooth decaymakes it more difficult for food and bacteria to stick to\ntooth surfaces. Saliva also appears to have a bufferingeffect on the acid produced by the plaque bacteria and toact as a remineralizing agent. Older patients should bemade aware that some prescription medications maydecrease salivary flow. Less saliva tends to increase theactivity of plaque bacteria and encourage further toothdecay. Chewing sugarless gum increases salivation andthus helps to lower the risk of tooth decay.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Dental Caries and Its Complications—Tooth Decay.” In The\nMerck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. 16th ed.

    "title": "Tooth extraction",
    "content": "Tooth extraction\nDefinition\nTooth extraction is the removal of a tooth from its\nsocket in the bone.\nPurpose\nExtraction is performed for positional, structural, or\neconomic reasons. Teeth are often removed because theyare impacted. Teeth become impacted when they are pre-vented from growing into their normal position in themouth by gum tissue, bone, or other teeth. Impaction is acommon reason for the extraction of wisdom teeth.Extraction is the only known method that will preventfurther problems. Teeth may also be extracted to makemore room in the mouth prior to straightening theremaining teeth (orthodontic treatment), or because theyare so badly positioned that straightening is impossible.Extraction may be used to remove teeth that are so badlydecayed or broken that they cannot be restored. In addi-tion, patients sometimes choose extraction as a lessexpensive alternative to filling or placing a crown on aseverely decayed tooth.\nPrecautions\nIn some situations, tooth extractions may need to be\npostponed temporarily. These situations include:\n• Infection that has progressed from the tooth into the\nbone. Infections may make anesthesia difficult. They canbe treated with antibiotics before the tooth is extracted. \n• The patient’s use of drugs that thin the blood (anticoagu-\nlants). These medications include warfarin (Coumadin)and aspirin . The patient should stop using these med-\nications for three days prior to extraction. \n• Patients who have had any of the following procedures\nin the previous six months: heart valve replacement ,\nopen heart surgery, prosthetic joint replacement ,o r\nplacement of a medical shunt. These patients may begiven antibiotics to reduce the risk of bacterial infection.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3332Tooth extractionDescription\nTooth extraction can be performed with local anes-\nthesia if the tooth is exposed and appears to be easilyremovable in one piece. An instrument called an elevatoris used to loosen (luxate) the tooth, widen the space inthe bone, and break the tiny elastic fibers that attach thetooth to the bone. Once the tooth is dislocated from thebone, it can be lifted and removed with forceps.\nIf the extraction is likely to be difficult, the dentist\nmay refer the patient to an oral surgeon. Oral surgeons arespecialists who are trained to give nitrous oxide, an intra-venous sedative, or a general anesthetic to relieve pain .\nExtracting an impacted tooth or a tooth with curved\nroots typically requires cutting through gum tissue toexpose the tooth. It may also require removing portions ofbone to free the tooth. Some teeth must be cut andremoved in sections. The extraction site may or may notrequire one or more stitches to close the cut (incision).\nPreparation\nBefore an extraction, the dentist will take the\npatient’s medical history, noting allergies and prescrip-\ntion medications. A dental history is also taken, with par-ticular attention to previous extractions and reactions toanesthetics. The dentist may then prescribe antibiotics orKEY TERMS\nDry socket —A painful condition following tooth\nextraction in which a blood clot does not properlyfill the empty socket.

The tooth is x-rayed to determine its fullshape and position, especially if it is impacted.\nIf the patient is going to have deep anesthesia, he or\nshe should wear loose clothing with sleeves that are easilyrolled up to allow for an intravenous line. The patientshould not eat or drink anything for at least six hours beforethe procedure. Arrangements should be made for a friendor relative to drive the patient home after the surgery.\nAftercare\nAn important aspect of aftercare is encouraging a\nclot to form at the extraction site. The patient should putpressure on the area by biting gently on a roll or wad ofgauze for several hours after surgery. Once the clot isformed, it should not be disturbed. The patient should notrinse, spit, drink with a straw, or smoke for at least 24hours after the extraction and preferably longer. Vigorousexercise should not be done for the first three to five days.\nFor the first two days after the procedure, the patient\nshould drink liquids without using a straw, and eat softfoods. Any chewing must be done on the side away fromthe extraction site. Hard or sticky foods should be avoid-ed. The mouth may be gently cleaned with a toothbrush,but the extraction area should not be scrubbed.\nWrapped ice packs can be applied to reduce facial\nswelling. Swelling is a normal part of the healingprocess. It is most noticeable in the first 48–72 hours. Asthe swelling subsides, the patient may experience musclestiffness. Moist heat and gentle exercise will restore jawmovement. The dentist may prescribe medications torelieve the postoperative pain.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3333Tooth extraction\nA close-up view inside a person’s mouth following the\nextraction of the lower right molar.

An additionalcomplication is called dry socket. When a blood clotdoes not properly form in the empty tooth socket, thebone beneath the socket is painfully exposed to air andfood, and the extraction site heals more slowly.\nNormal results\nAfter an extraction, the wound usually closes in\nabout two weeks.

Fillings, inlays, andcrowns are intended to repair damage to individual teeth.They replace tooth structure lost by decay or injury, pro-tect the part of the tooth that remains, and restore thetooth’s shape and function. Bridges, dentures, andimplants are intended to protect the shape and function ofthe mouth as a whole.\nPrecautions\nSome patients are allergic to the medications used\nfor local anesthesia in dental restorations. In addition,many people in the general population are afraid of den-tal work. Most dentists in present-day practice can helppatients with this specific fear.\nDescription\nFillings\nFillings are restorations that are done to repair dam-\nage caused by tooth decay (dental caries). Tooth decay\noccurs when microorganisms in the mouth convert sugarfrom food to acid, which attacks the tooth. The acidforms cavities that start in the hard outer surface of thetooth (the enamel) and may extend inward to the pulp,which contains the tooth’s nerves and blood vessels. Leftuntreated, tooth decay may lead to inflammation andinfection that may cause toothache and perhaps more\nserious complications.\nTo stop the decay process, the dentist removes the\ndecayed portion of the tooth using a high-speed drill or anair abrasion system, shapes the cavity walls, and replacesthe tooth structure with a filling of silver amalgam, com-posite resin, or gold. The filling is placed in the cavity as aliquid or soft solid. It sets within a few minutes and contin-ues to harden over the next several hours. Silver amalgamis commonly used to fill cavities on the biting surfaces ofthe back teeth, because it is strong enough to withstand thetremendous pressures exerted by grinding and chewing.Composite resin is typically used to fill cavities in frontteeth and any other teeth that are visible when the patientsmiles, because its color can be matched to the tooth sur-face. Gold as a filling material is far less common, but isbeing increasingly used. Although it is more expensiveand less easily applied, it does not trigger the sensitivityreactions that some patients have to silver amalgam.\nInlays\nAn inlay resembles a filling in that it fills the space\nremaining after the decayed portion of a tooth has beenremoved. The difference is that an inlay is shaped outsidethe patient’s mouth and then cemented into place. After thedecay is removed and the cavity walls are shaped, the den-tist makes a wax pattern of the space. A mold is cast fromthe wax pattern. An inlay, usually of gold, is made fromthis mold and sealed into the tooth with dental cement.\nCrowns\nThe crown of a tooth is the portion that is covered by\nenamel. A restorative crown replaces this outer part toprotect the tooth. This protection becomes necessarywhen a tooth cracks or has its entire structure weakenedby decay. As with a filling or inlay, the dentist firstremoves the decayed portion of the tooth. The tooth is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3334Tooth replacements and restorationsthen prepared for a crown. It may be tapered on the out-\nside edges to a peg, reinforced with a cast metal core, orrebuilt with both a cast metal core and a post. A waximpression of the prepared tooth and the teeth next to it ismade. The new crown is made to fit this mold. The crownmay be made of gold or stainless steel alone, metal with aveneer of tooth-colored porcelain or resin, or of porcelainor resin alone. The finished crown is then placed over theprepared tooth, adjusted, and cemented into place.\nBridges\nBridges are a type of restoration that is done when\none or more permanent teeth are lost or pulled. Theresulting gap must be filled in to prevent the remainingteeth from shifting. If the other teeth shift, they willaffect the patient’s bite (occlusion), which sometimesproduces pain in the jaw joint. As the teeth move and\nbecome crooked, they also become more difficult to keepclean. The risk of tooth decay and gum disease increases,increasing the likelihood that additional teeth will belost. A bridge is inserted to prevent this risk. Bridges arenonremovable appliances of one or more artificial teeth(pontics) anchored by crowns on the adjacent teeth (abut-ment teeth). The abutment teeth carry the pressure whenthe patient chews food.\nPartial dentures\nA partial denture is similar to a bridge in that it fills\na gap left by missing teeth with artificial teeth on a metalframe. A partial denture is removable, however. It attach-es to a crown on the abutment tooth with a metal clasp orprecision attachment. A partial denture is primarily usedat the end of a row of natural teeth, where there is onlyone abutment tooth. The pressure exerted by chewing isshared by this abutment and the soft tissues of the gumridge beneath the appliance.\nComplete dentures\nComplete dentures may be worn when all of the top\nor bottom teeth have been lost. A complete denture con-sists of artificial teeth mounted in a plastic base moldedto fit the remaining oral anatomy. It may or may not beheld in place with a denture adhesive.\nImplants\nDental implants are a means of securing crowns,\nbridges, and dentures in the mouth. A hard plastic ormetal fixture is implanted through the soft tissue into thebone. Over time, the bone grows around this fixture,firmly anchoring it. The exposed end of this fixture iscovered with a crown and may serve as a stable abutmentfor a bridge or denture.Preparation\nBefore a restoration is placed in the mouth, the den-\ntist removes all traces of decay and shapes the remainingtooth structure for the restoration. Fillings are the onlyrestoration created within the tooth itself—the others aremade up in a laboratory using a model of the tooth struc-ture. Thus, a filling may be placed in a single dental visit,while the other restorations usually take several appoint-ments. Temporary crowns and dentures are put in placeafter the tooth is shaped until the permanent restoration isdelivered by the laboratory.\nAftercare\nFillings\nFillings need time to harden for several hours after\nbeing placed, so the patient should chew food on theopposite side of the mouth for the first day.\nDentures\nA partial or complete denture may take several\nweeks of getting used to. Inserting and removing thedenture will take practice. Speaking clearly may be diffi-cult at first—the patient may find it helpful to read outloud for practice. Eating may also feel awkward. Thepatient should begin by eating small pieces of soft foods.Very hard or sticky foods should be avoided.\nPatients with dentures must work on good oral\nhygiene . Specialty brushes and floss threaders may be\nused to remove plaque and food from around crowns andbridges. Dentures should be removed and brushed dailywith a specially designed brush and a denture cleaner orother mild soap.\nThe patient should see the dentist for an adjustment\nif there is any discomfort or irritation resulting from arestoration.

    "title": "Toothache",
    "content": "Toothache\nDefinition\nA toothache is any pain or soreness within or\naround a tooth, indicating inflammation and possibleinfection.\nDescription\nA toothache may feel like a sharp pain or a dull\nache. The tooth may be sensitive to pressure, heat, cold,or sweets. In cases of severe pain, identifying the prob-lem tooth is often difficult. Any patient with a toothacheshould see a dentist at once for diagnosis and treatment.Most toothaches get worse if not treated.\nCauses and symptoms\nToothaches may result from any of a number of\ncauses:\n•tooth decay (dental caries)\n• inflammation of the tooth pulp (pulpitis)\n• abscesses\n• gum disease, including periodontitis\n• loose or broken filling• cracked or impacted tooth\n• exposed tooth root\n• food wedged between teeth or trapped below the gum\nline\n• tooth nerve irritated by clenching or grinding of teeth\n(bruxism)\n• pressure from congested sinuses• traumatic injury\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis includes identifying the location of the\ntoothache, as well as the cause. The dentist begins by ask-ing the patient specific questions about the toothache,including the types of foods that make the pain worse,whether the tooth is sensitive to temperature or biting, andwhether the pain is worse at night. The dentist then exam-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3336Toothacheines the patient’s mouth for signs of swelling, redness,\nand obvious tooth damage. The presence of pus indicatesan abscess or gum disease. The dentist may flush the sore\narea with warm water to dislodge any food particles andto test for sensitivity to heat. The dentist may then dry thearea with gauze to determine sensitivity to touch andpressure. The dentist may probe tooth crevices and theedges of fillings with a sharp instrument, looking forareas of tooth decay. Finally, the dentist may take x rays,looking for evidence of decay between teeth, a cracked orimpacted tooth, or a disorder of the underlying bone.\nTreatment\nEmergency self-care\nToothaches should always be professionally treated\nby a dentist. Some methods of self-treatment, however,may help manage the pain until professional care isavailable:\n• rinsing with warm salt water• using dental floss to remove any food particles\n• taking aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve\npain; the drug should be swallowed— never placed\ndirectly on the aching tooth or gum\n• applying a cold compress against the outside of the\ncheek; do not use heat, because it will tend to spreadinfection\n• using clove oil ( Syzygium aromaticum ) to numb the\ngums; the oil may be rubbed directly on the sore area orused to soak a small piece of cotton and applied to thesore tooth\nProfessional care\nTreatment will depend on the underlying cause of\nthe toothache. If the pain is due to tooth decay, the dentistwill remove the decayed area and restore the tooth with afilling of silver amalgam or composite resin. Loose orbroken fillings are removed, new decay cleaned out, anda new filling is placed. If the pulp of the tooth is dam-aged, root canal therapy is needed. The dentist or a spe-cialist called an endodontist removes the decayed pulp,fills the space left behind with a soothing paste, and cov-ers the tooth with a crown to protect and seal it. If thedamage cannot be treated by these methods, or if thetooth is impacted, the tooth must be extracted.\nAlternative treatment\nToothaches caused by infection or tooth decay must\nbe treated by a dentist. Several alternative therapies maybe helpful for pain relief until dental treatment is avail-KEY TERMS\nAbscess —A hole in the tooth or gum tissue filled\nwith pus as the result of infection.\nBruxism —Habitual clenching and grinding of the\nteeth as a result of stress. The behavior usuallyoccurs during sleep.\nCavity —A hole or weak spot in the tooth surface\ncaused by decay.\nDental caries —A disease of the teeth in which\nmicroorganisms convert sugar in the mouth toacid, which then erodes the tooth.\nEnamel —The hard outermost surface of a tooth.\nEndodontist —A dentist who specializes in diag-\nnosing and treating diseases of the pulp and otherinner parts of the tooth.\nImpacted tooth —A tooth that is growing against\nanother tooth, bone, or soft tissue.\nPeriodontitis —A gum disease that destroys the\nstructures supporting the teeth, including bone.\nPulp—The soft innermost part of a tooth, contain-\ning blood vessels and nerves.\nPulpitis —Inflammation of the pulp of a tooth that\ninvolves the blood vessels and nerves.\nable. Clove oil ( Syzygium aromaticum ) may be rubbed\non sensitive gums to numb them or added to a small cot-ton pellet that is then placed into or over a hole in thetooth. The herb corydalis ( Corydalis yanhusuo ) may also\nhelp relieve toothache pain. Pain also may be reducedusing acupressure ,acupuncture , or reiki . Acupuncture\nshould be done only by a licensed practitioner.\nPrognosis\nPrompt dental treatment provides a positive outcome\nfor toothache. In the absence of active infection, fillings,root canal treatments, or extractions may be performedwith minimal discomfort to the patient. When atoothache is left untreated, a severe infection may devel-op and spread to the sinuses or jawbone, and eventuallycause blood poisoning . \nPrevention\nMaintaining proper oral hygiene is the key to pre-\nventing toothaches. The best way to prevent tooth decayis to brush at least twice a day, preferably after every\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3337Toothachemeal and snack. Flossing once a day also helps prevent\ngum disease by removing food particles and bacteria atand below the gum line, as well as between teeth.

    "title": "TORCH test",
    "content": "TORCH test\nDefinition\nThe TORCH test, which is sometimes called the\nTORCH panel, belongs to a category of blood tests calledinfectious-disease antibody titer tests. This type of bloodtest measures the presence of antibodies (protein mole-cules produced by the human immune system in responseto a specific disease agent) and their level of concentra-tion in the blood. The name of the test comes from the ini-tial letters of the five disease categories. The TORCH testmeasures the levels of an infant’s antibodies against fivegroups of chronic infections: toxoplasmosis, other infec-\ntions, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes sim-\nplex virus (HSV). The “other infections” usually includesyphilis ,hepatitis B , coxsackie virus, Epstein-Barr virus,\nvaricella-zoster virus, and human parvovirus.\nSince the TORCH test is a screening or first-level\ntest, the pediatrician may order tests of other body fluidsor tissues to confirm the diagnosis of a specific infection.In the case of toxoplasmosis ,rubella , and syphilis, cere-\nbrospinal fluid may be obtained from the infant through aspinal tap in order to confirm the diagnosis. In the case ofCMV , the diagnosis is confirmed by culturing the virus ina sample of the infant’s urine. In HSV infections, tissueculture is the best method to confirm the diagnosis.Purpose\nThe five categories of organisms whose antibodies\nare measured by the TORCH test are grouped togetherbecause they can cause a cluster of symptomatic birth\ndefects in newborns. This group of defects is sometimes\ncalled the TORCH syndrome. A newborn baby withthese symptoms will be given a TORCH test to see if anyof the five types of infection are involved.\nThe symptoms of the TORCH syndrome include:\n• Small size in proportion to length of the mother’s preg-\nnancy at time of delivery. Infants who are smaller than\nwould be expected (below the tenth percentile) arereferred to as small-for-gestational-age, or SGA. \n• Enlarged liver and spleen • Low level of platelets in the blood \n• Skin rash. The type of skin rash associated with the\nTORCH syndrome is usually reddish-purple or brownand is caused by the leakage of blood from broken cap-illaries into the baby’s skin. \n• Involvement of the central nervous system. These\ndefects can include encephalitis , calcium deposits in\nthe brain tissue, and seizures. \n• Jaundice. The yellowish discoloration of the skin and\nwhites of the eyes due to liver disease.\nIn addition to these symptoms, each of the TORCH\ninfections has its own characteristic symptom cluster innewborns:\nToxoplasmosis\nToxoplasmosis is caused by Toxoplasma gondii ,a\nparasite that the mother can acquire from handlinginfected cats, drinking unpasteurized milk, or eating con-taminated meat. The infection is carried to the infantthrough the mother’s placenta, and can cause infectionsof the eyes or central nervous system. The organism caninvade brain or muscle tissue and form tissue cysts. Thelater in pregnancy that the mother is infected, the higherthe probability that the fetus will be infected. On theother hand, toxoplasmosis early in pregnancy is morelikely to cause a miscarriage or serious birth defects.\nThe incidence of toxoplasmosis in newborns is one in1,000 live births.\nOther (syphilis)\nSyphilis is caused by a spirochete (spiral- or coil-\nshaped bacterium), Treponema pallidum . It is transmitted\nin the adult population by sexual intercourse. About 2-5% of children born to mothers diagnosed with syphiliswill have the disease at birth. Syphilis was added to the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3338TORCH testTORCH panel because of a rapid increase in reported\ncases since 1990. It is also a potentially life-threateninginfection for the fetus. Syphilis can cause early delivery,miscarriage, or stillbirth . The mortality rate in infants\ninfected with syphilis is about 54%.\nRubella\nRubella is a virus that has a seasonal pattern, with\nepidemics most likely in the spring. Between 0.1-2% ofnewborns will be infected with rubella. The rate of fetalinfection varies according to the timing of the mother’sinfection during pregnancy. Birth defects, however, aremost likely (85%) in infants infected during the firsteight weeks of pregnancy. Infants born with rubella mayalready show signs of heart disease, retarded growth,hearing loss , blood disorders, vision problems, or pneu-\nmonia . They may also develop problems later in child-\nhood, including autism , hearing loss, brain syndromes,\nimmune system disorders, or thyroid disease.\nCytomegalovirus (CMV)\nCytomegalovirus belongs to the herpesvirus group\nof infections. It can be transmitted through body secre-tions, as well as by sexual contact; some newbornsacquire CMV through the mother’s breast milk. In adults,it produces symptoms resembling those of mononucleo-sis. About 1–2.2% of newborns in the United States areinfected with CMV . Of this group, 10% will have mea-surable symptoms. The mortality rate for these sympto-matic newborns is 20–30%. Surviving infants with CMVmay suffer from hearing problems (15%) or mental\nretardation (30%). Newborns that acquire CMV during\nthe birth process or shortly after birth may develop pneu-monia, hepatitis, or various blood disorders.\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV)\nHerpesvirus infections are among the most common\nviral infections in humans. They are spread by oral, aswell as genital, contact. It is estimated that between 1 in1,000 and 1 in 5,000 infants are born with HSV infec-tions. About 80% of these infections are acquired duringthe birth process itself; the virus enters the infant throughits eyes, skin, mouth, and upper respiratory tract. Ofinfants born with HSV infection, about 20% will havelocalized infections of the eyes, mouth, or skin. About50% of infected infants will develop disease spreadthroughout the body (disseminated) within nine to 11days after birth. Disseminated herpes infections attackthe liver and adrenal glands, as well as other bodyorgans. Without treatment, the mortality rate is 80%.Even with antiviral medication, the mortality rate is still15–20%, with 40–55% of the survivors having long-termdamage to the central nervous system. It is critical for the\ndoctor to diagnose HSV infection in the newborn as soonas possible, for effective treatment.\nDescription\nThe TORCH panel requires a sample of the infant’s\nblood. Samples from infants are usually obtained by theheelstick procedure when only a small quantity of bloodis needed. The baby’s foot is wrapped in a warm cloth forfive minutes, to make the blood flow more easily. Thefoot is then wiped with an alcohol swab and a lancet isused to stick the baby’s heel on one side. It is importantto avoid the center of the heel, in order to prevent aninflammation of the bone.\nPreparation\nNo special preparation, other than sterile technique,\nis required.\nRisks\nThe only complications associated with the TORCH\ntest are those resulting from the heelstick techniqueitself. These risks include scarring, infection of the bone,cellulitis (inflammation of cellular tissue), small lumpy\ncalcium deposits, and inaccurate test results.\nNormal results\nThe normal result would be normal levels of\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody in the infant’s blood.IgM is one of five types of protein molecules found inblood that function as antibodies. IgM is a specific classof antibodies that seeks out virus particles. In contrast toadults, IgM is the most common type of immunoglobulinin newborn children. It is, therefore, the most useful indi-cator of the presence of a TORCH infection.\nAbnormal results\nThe general abnormal, or positive, finding would be\nhigh levels of IgM antibody. The test can be refined fur-ther for antibodies specific to given disease agents. TheTORCH screen, however, can produce both false-posi-tive and false-negative findings. Doctors can measureIgM levels in the infant’s cerebrospinal fluid, as well asin the blood, if they want to confirm the TORCH results.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCruse, Julius M., and Robert E. Lewis.

Cervical dystonia causes\nforward twisting, and is called antecollis. Backwardtwisting is known as retrocollis. The abnormal posturecaused by torticollis is often debilitating, and is usuallypainful. \nTorticollis most commonly begins between age\n30–60, with females affected twice as often as males.According to the National Spasmodic TorticollisAssociation, torticollis affects 83,000 people in theUnited States. Dystonia tends to become more severeduring the first months or years after onset, and mayspread to other regions, especially the jaw, arm, orleg. Torticollis should not be confused with suchother causes of abnormal neck posture as orthopedicor congenital problems.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe nerve signals responsible for torticollis are\nthought to originate in the basal ganglia, a group of brainstructures involved in movement control. The exactdefect is unknown. Some cases of dystonia are due to theinheritance of a defective gene, whose function wasunknown as of mid-1998. Other cases are correlated withneck or head trauma, such as from an automobile acci-dent. Use of certain antipsychotic drugs , or neurolep-\ntics, can induce dystonia.\nThere are three types of torticollis:\n• tonic, in which the abnormal posture is sustained\n• clonic, marked by jerky head movements.• mixed, a combination of tonic and clonic movements\nSymptoms usually begin gradually, and may be\nintermittent at first, worsening in times of stress . Symp-\ntoms usually progress over two to five years, and thenremain steady. Symptoms may be relieved somewhatwhen lying down. Many people with torticollis can tem-porarily correct their head position by sensory tricks, astouching the chin or cheek on the side opposite the turn-ing. The reason for the effectiveness of this “geste antag-oniste,” as it is called, is unknown.\nPain in the neck, back, or shoulder affects more than\ntwo-thirds of all people with torticollis. Pain may spreadto the arm or hand.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of torticollis is aided by an electrical\nstudy ( electromyography ) that can detect overactive\nmuscles.

    "title": "Tourette syndrome",
    "content": "Tourette syndrome\nDefinition\nTourette syndrome (TS) is an inherited disorder of\nthe nervous system, characterized by a variable expres-sion of unwanted movements and noises (tics).\nDescription\nThe first references in the literature to what might\ntoday be classified as Tourette syndrome largely describeindividuals who were wrongly believed to be possessedby the devil. In 1885 Gilles de la Tourette, a French neu-rologist, provided the first formal description of this syn-drome, which he described as an inherited neurologicalcondition characterized by motor and vocal tics.\nAlthough vocal and motor tics are the hallmark of\nTourette syndrome, such other symptoms as the expres-sion of socially inappropriate comments or behaviors,obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder,self-injuring behavior, depression, and anxiety also\nappear to be associated with Tourette syndrome. Mostresearch suggests that Tourette syndrome is an autosomaldominant disorder, although a gene responsible forTourette syndrome has not yet been discovered.\nTourette syndrome is found in all populations and all\nethnic groups, but is three to four times more common inmales than females and is more common in children thanadults. The exact frequency of Tourette syndrome isunknown, but estimates range from 0.05% to 3%.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown,\nalthough some studies suggest that the tics in Tourettesyndrome are caused by an increased amount of a neuro-transmitter called dopamine. A neurotransmitter is achemical found in the brain that helps to transmit infor-mation from one brain cell to another. Other studies sug-gest that the defect in Tourette syndrome involves anoth-er neurotransmitter called serotonin; or involves otherchemicals required for normal functioning of the brain.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3341Tourette syndromeMost studies suggest that Tourette syndrome is an\nautosomal dominant disorder with decreased penetrance,although this hypothesis has not been proven and may notbe true in all families. An autosomal dominant disorderresults from a change in one copy of a pair of genes. Indi-viduals with an autosomal dominant disorder have a 50%chance of passing on the changed gene to their children.Decreased penetrance means that not all people whoinherit the changed gene will develop symptoms. There issome evidence that females who inherit the Tourette syn-drome gene have a 70% chance of exhibiting symptomsand males have a 99% chance of having symptoms. It hasbeen suggested that other genetic and environmental fac-tors may play a role in the development of symptoms inpeople who inherit the changed gene but none have beendiscovered. Some researchers believe that Tourette syn-drome has different causes in different individuals or iscaused by changes in more than one gene, although thesetheories are less substantiated. Further research is neededto establish the cause of Tourette syndrome.\nMotor and vocal tics\nThe principal symptoms of Tourette syndrome\ninclude simple and complex motor and vocal tics. Simplemotor tics are characterized by brief muscle contractionsof one or more limited muscle groups. An eye twitch isan example of a simple motor tic. Complex motor ticstend to appear more complicated and purposeful thansimple tics, and involve coordinated contractions of sev-eral muscle groups. Some examples of complex motortics include the act of hitting oneself and jumping.Copropraxia, the involuntary display of unacceptable/obscene gestures; and echopraxia, the imitation of themovement of another individual, are other examples ofcomplex motor tics.\nV ocal tics are actually manifestations of motor tics\nthat involve the muscles required for vocalization. Sim-ple vocal tics include stuttering , stammering, abnormal\nemphasis of part of a word or phrase, and inarticulatenoises such as throat clearing, grunts, and high-pitchedsounds. Complex vocal tics typically involve the involun-tary expression of words. Perhaps the most strikingexample of this is coprolalia, the involuntary expressionof obscene words or phrases, which occurs in fewer thanone-third of people with Tourette syndrome. The invol-untary echoing of the last word, phrase, sentence orsound vocalized by oneself (phalilalia) or of another per-son or sound in the environment (echolalia) are also clas-sified as complex tics.\nThe type, frequency, and severity of tics exhibited\nvaries tremendously between individuals with Tourettesyndrome. Tourette syndrome has a variable age of onsetand tics can start anytime between infancy and age 18.\nInitial symptoms usually occur before the early teens; themean age of onset for both males and females is approxi-mately seven years of age. Most individuals with symp-toms initially experience simple muscle tics involvingthe eyes and the head. These symptoms can progress totics involving the upper torso, neck, arms, hands, andoccasionally the legs and feet. Complex motor tics areusually the latest-onset muscle tics. V ocal tics usuallyhave a later onset then motor tics. In some rare cases,people with Tourette syndrome suddenly present withmultiple, severe, or bizarre symptoms.\nNot only is there extreme variability in clinical\nsymptoms between individuals with Tourette syndrome,but individuals commonly experience a variability intype, frequency, and severity of symptoms over thecourse of their lifetime. Adolescents with Tourette syn-drome often experience unpredictable and variablesymptoms, which may be related to fluctuating hormonelevels and decreased compliance in taking medications.Adults often experience a decrease in symptoms or acomplete end to symptoms.\nA number of factors appear to affect the severity and\nfrequency of tics. Stress appears to increase the frequency\nand severity of tics, while concentration on another part ofthe body that is not involved in a tic can result in the tem-porary alleviation of symptoms. Relaxation, followingattempts to suppress the occurrence of tics, may result inan increased frequency of tics. An increased frequency andseverity of tics can also result from exposure to such drugsas steroids, cocaine , amphetamines, and caffeine . Hor-\nmonal changes such as those that occur prior to the men-strual cycle can also increase the severity of symptoms.\nOther associated symptoms\nPeople with Tourette syndrome are more likely to\nexhibit non-obscene, socially inappropriate behaviorssuch as expressing insulting or socially unacceptablecomments or socially unacceptable actions. It is notknown whether these symptoms stem from a more gener-al dysfunction of impulse control that might be part ofTourette syndrome.\nTourette syndrome appears to also be associated\nwith attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD is a disordercharacterized by a short attention span and impulsivity,and in some cases hyperactivity. Researchers have foundthat 21–90% of individuals with Tourette syndrome alsoexhibit symptoms of ADD, whereas 2–15% of the gener-al population exhibit symptoms of ADD.\nPeople with Tourette syndrome are also at higher\nrisk for having symptoms of obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder (OCD). OCD is a disorder characterized by persis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3342Tourette syndrometent, intrusive, and senseless thoughts (obsessions) or\ncompulsions to perform repetitive behaviors that inter-fere with normal functioning. A person with OCD, forexample, may be obsessed with germs and may counter-act this obsession with continual hand washing. Symp-toms of OCD are present in 1.9–3% of the general popu-lation, whereas 28–50% of people with Tourette syn-drome have symptoms of OCD.\nSelf-injurious behavior (SIB) is also seen more fre-\nquently in those with Tourette syndrome. Approximately34–53% of individuals with Tourette syndrome exhibitsome form of self-injuring behavior. The SIB is oftenrelated to OCD but can also occur in those with Tourettesyndrome who do not have OCD.\nSymptoms of anxiety and depression are also found\nmore commonly in people with Tourette syndrome. It isnot clear, however, whether these symptoms are symp-toms of Tourette syndrome or occur as a result of havingto deal with the symptoms of moderate to severe Tourettesyndrome.\nPeople with Tourette syndrome may also be at\nincreased risk for having learning disabilities and per-\nsonality disorders; and may be more predisposed to\nsuch behaviors as aggression, antisocial behaviors,severe temper outbursts, and inappropriate sexual behav-ior. Further controlled studies need to be performed,however, to ascertain whether these behaviors are symp-toms of Tourette syndrome.\nDiagnosis\nTourette syndrome cannot be diagnosed through a\nblood test. The diagnosis is made through observationand interview of the patient and discussions with otherfamily members. The diagnosis, of Tourette syndrome iscomplicated by a variety of factors. The extreme rangeof symptoms of this disorder makes it difficult to differ-entiate Tourette syndrome from other disorders withsimilar symptoms. Diagnosis is further complicated bythe fact that some tics appear to be within the range ofnormal behavior. For example an individual who onlyexhibits such tics as throat clearing and sniffing may bemisdiagnosed with a medical problem such as allergies .\nIn addition, such bizarre and complex tics as coprolaliamay be mistaken for psychotic or “bad” behavior. Diag-nosis is also confounded by individuals who attempt tocontrol tics in public and in front of health care profes-sionals, and deny the existence of symptoms. Althoughthere is disagreement over what criteria should be usedto diagnose Tourette syndrome, one aid in the diagnosisis the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-\norders (DSM-IV). The DSM-IV outlines suggesteddiagnostic criteria for a variety of conditions, including\nTourette syndrome.\nDSM-IV criteria:\n• presence of both motor and vocal tics at some time dur-\ning the course of the illness\n• the occurrence of multiple tics nearly every day through\na period of more than one year, without a remission oftics for a period of greater than three consecutive months\n• the symptoms cause distress or impairment in function-\ning\n• age of onset of prior to 18 years of age\n• the symptoms are not due to medications or drugs and\nare not related to another medical condition\nSome physicians critique the DSM-IV criteria, argu-\ning that they do not include the full range of behaviors andsymptoms seen in Tourette syndrome. Others criticize thecriteria since they limit the diagnosis to those who experi-ence a significant impairment, which may not be true forindividuals with milder symptoms. For this reason manyphysicians use their clinical judgment as well as the DSM-IV criteria as a guide to diagnosing Tourette syndrome.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for Tourette syndrome. Treatment\ninvolves the control of symptoms through educationaland psychological interventions and/or medications. Thetreatment and management of Tourette syndrome variesfrom patient to patient and should focus on the allevia-tion of the symptoms that are most bothersome to thepatient or that cause the most interference with dailyfunctioning.\nPsychological and educational interventions\nPsychological treatments such as counseling are not\ngenerally useful for the treatment of tics but can be bene-ficial in the treatment of such associated symptoms asobsessive-compulsive behavior and attention deficit dis-order. Counseling may also help individuals to cope betterwith the symptoms of this disorder and to have more posi-tive social interactions. Psychological interventions mayalso help people cope better with stressors that can nor-mally be triggers for tics and negative behaviors. Relax-ation therapies may, however, increase the occurrence oftics. The education of family members, teachers, andpeers about Tourette syndrome can be helpful and mayhelp to foster acceptance and prevent social isolation .\nMedications\nMany people with mild symptoms of Tourette syn-\ndrome never require medications. Those with severe\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3343Tourette syndromesymptoms may require medications for all or part of\ntheir lifetime. The most effective treatment of tics asso-ciated with Tourette syndrome involves the use of drugssuch as haloperidol, pimozide, sulpiride, and tiapride,which decrease the amount of dopamine in the body.Unfortunately, the incidence of side effects, even at lowdosages, is quite high. The short-term side effects caninclude sedation , dysphoria, weight gain, movement\nabnormalities, depression, and poor school perfor-mance. Long-term side effects can include phobias ,\nmemory difficulties, and personality changes. Thesedrugs are therefore better candidates for short-termrather than long-term therapy.\nTourette syndrome can also be treated with such\nother drugs as clonidine, clonazepam, and risperidone,but the efficacy of these treatments is unknown. Inmany cases, treatment of such associated conditions asADD and OCD is often more of a concern than the ticsthemselves. Clonidine used in conjunction with suchstimulants as Ritalin may be useful for treating peoplewith Tourette syndrome who also have symptoms ofADD. Stimulants should be used with caution in indi-viduals with Tourette syndrome since they can some-times increase the frequency and severity of tics. OCDsymptoms in those with Tourette syndrome are oftentreated with such drugs as Prozac, Luvox, Paxil, andZoloft.\nIn many cases the treatment of Tourette syndrome\nwith medications can be discontinued after adolescence.Trials should be performed through the gradual taperingoff of medications and should always be done under adoctor’s supervision.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for Tourette syndrome in individuals\nwithout associated psychological conditions is oftenquite good, and only approximately 10% of Tourette syn-drome individuals experience severe tic symptoms.Approximately 30% of people with Tourette syndromewill experience a decrease in the frequency and severityof tics, and another 30–40% will experience a completeend of symptoms by late adolescence. The other 30–40%will continue to exhibit moderate to severe symptoms inadulthood. There does not appear to be a definite correla-tion between the type, frequency, and severity of symp-toms and the eventual prognosis. Patients with severe ticsmay experience social difficulties and may isolate them-selves from others in fear of shocking and embarrassingthem. People with Tourette syndrome who have such\nother symptoms as obsessive compulsive disorder, atten-tion deficit disorder, and self-injurious behavior usuallyhave a poorer prognosis.KEY TERMS\nAttention deficit disorder (ADD) —Disorder char-\nacterized by a short attention span, impulsivity,and in some cases hyperactivity.\nAutosomal dominant —A pattern of genetic inheri-\ntance in which only one abnormal gene is neededto display the trait or disease.\nCoprolalia —The involuntary expression of\nobscene words or phrases.\nCopropraxia —The involuntary display of unac-\nceptable/obscene gestures.\nDecreased penetrance —Individuals who inherit a\nchanged disease gene but do not develop symp-toms.\nDysphoria —Feelings of anxiety, restlessness, and\ndissatisfaction.\nEcholalia —Involuntary echoing of the last word,\nphrase, or sentence spoken by someone else orsound in the environment.\nEchopraxia —The imitation of the movement of\nanother individual.\nNeurotransmitter —Chemical in the brain that\ntransmits information from one nerve cell toanother.\nObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) —Disorder\ncharacterized by persistent, intrusive, and sense-less thoughts (obsessions) or compulsions to per-form repetitive behaviors that interfere with nor-mal functioning.\nPhalilalia —Involuntary echoing of the last word,\nphrase, sentence, or sound vocalized by oneself.\nTic—Brief and intermittent involuntary movement\nor sound.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHaerle, Tracy, ed., and Jim Eisenreich.

    "title": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis",
    "content": "Toxic epidermal necrolysis\nDefinition\nToxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare condition that\ncauses large portions of the epidermis, the skin’s outer-most layer, to detach from the layers of skin below. Areaction to a medication is the primary cause. \nDescription\nToxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) begins with\nfever ,cough , and other nonspecific symptoms, and is\nsoon followed by purplish, bloody-looking lesions on theskin and mucous membranes. These early lesions, typi-cally found on the head, neck, and upper chest, soonmerge and blister. Sheets of epidermis then begin todetach from the skin layers below. In time, the entire sur-face of the skin may be involved, with detachment of100% of the epidermis. \nCauses and symptoms\nThe main cause of TEN is a severe drug reaction.\nSome investigators believe there may be additional infec-tious causes. A severe reaction in transplant patients,called graft-vs.-host disease , can also produce TEN.\nOne study reported more than 100 different drugs ascauses of TEN. The drugs most commonly implicated,however, include antibacterial sulfonamides such as sul-\nfadiazine, antibiotics such as aminopenicillins and\ncephalosporins , and anticonvulsants like phenytoin.\nTEN is extremely rare. Researchers estimate that thereare 0.2 cases per million users of aminopenicillins and4.5 cases per million users of sulfonamides. \nExactly what leads to detachment of the epidermis\nremains unclear. People with TEN seem to have difficul-ty metabolizing the offending drug. Some researcherssuggest that certain substances that should be clearedfrom the body instead get deposited on the outer shell ofthe epidermis, causing an immune response that leads thebody to “reject” the skin.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made primarily on the appearance and\nspread of the skin lesions , and on a history that includes\nintroduction of a new medication within the previous oneto three weeks. A biopsy of the early lesions will confirmthe diagnosis. Physicians will consider other potential dis-eases that cause similar symptoms before reaching a diag-nosis of TEN. One is erythema multiforme , a recurrent\nskin disorder that produces lesions similar in appearance toTEN. However, this disorder is not caused by a drug reac-tion and does not lead to sheet-like shedding of the skin.Another disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, is a drug-induced skin disease that some experts believe is really amilder form of TEN. Staphylococcal scalded skin syn-\ndrome (SSSS) also looks like TEN, but it is caused by a\nstaphylococcal infection. Unlike TEN, which occurs rarelyin children, SSSS primarily affects infants, young children,and adults with weakened immune systems.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for TEN. Patients are\ntypically treated in an intensive care unit or in a burn unitand receive treatment similar to that given to patientswith major burns . With the loss of skin, severe dehydra-\ntion is a major risk, so health care workers will attempt\nto replace fluids intravenously. Nutritional supplementa-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3345Toxic epidermal necrolysistion from a tube routed through the nose to the stomach\nmay also be contemplated to promote the healing of theskin. Infection is a major risk, so some physicians“paint” the open lesions with topical antiseptics . Others\nuse skin grafts taken from cadavers or cultured skin sub-stitutes to cover large open areas until healing can occur.Some investigators believe systemic corticosteroids are\nuseful in the treatment of TEN. But since these medica-tions have also been implicated as a cause in some casesof TEN and are known to suppress the immune system,their use should be considered carefully. \nPrognosis\nAbout 25–30% of patients with TEN die. Elderly\npatients, those with extensive skin lesions, and those withAIDS have the worst prognosis. Widespread systemic\ninfection ( sepsis ) is the primary cause of death . Survivors,\nhowever, will be completely healed in three to four weeks.\nPrevention\nThere is no prevention for TEN. No reliable test can\nindicate that a specific drug may cause TEN in a specificpatient. Some researchers believe skin tests of potentiallyoffending drugs may prove useful in the future. \nResources\nBOOKS\nFitzpatrick, Thomas B., et al.

    "title": "Toxic shock syndrome",
    "content": "Toxic shock syndrome\nDefinition\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an uncommon, but\npotentially serious, illness that occurs when poisonoussubstances (toxins) produced by certain bacteria enter thebloodstream. The toxins cause a type of blood poisoning\ncaused by staphylococcal, or less commonly streptococ-cal, infections in the lungs, throat, skin or bone, or frominjuries. Women using super-absorbent tampons duringmenstruation were found to be most likely to get toxicshock syndrome.\nDescription\nTSS first came to the attention of the public in the\n1970s. Shortly after the introduction of a super-absorbenttampon, young women across the United States experi-enced an epidemic of serious but unexplained symptoms.Thousands went to emergency rooms with high fever ,\nvomiting, peeling skin, low blood pressure, diarrhea ,\nand a rash resembling sunburn . The only thing they had\nin common was that they all were menstruating at thetime they felt sick, and all were using tampons—espe-cially super absorbent products.\nAt its height, the epidemic affected 15,000 people\nin the United States each year between 1980 and 1984;15% of the women died. Since the offending productswere taken off the market, the numbers of TSS caseshave declined sharply. As of 1998, only about 5,000cases are diagnosed annually in the United States, 5%of which are fatal. The decline is most likely due to thetampon manufacturers’ discontinuing the use of somesynthetic materials, and the removal from the marketof the brand of tampon associated with most cases ofTSS. Today, most of these products are made withrayon and cotton.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3346Toxic shock syndromeIn spite of TSS’ association with menstruating\nwomen, the disease can affect anyone of either sex or anyage or race. The infection may occur in children, men,and non-menstruating women who are weakened fromsurgery, injury, or disease, and who cannot fight off astaphylococcal infection. New mothers are also at higherrisk for TSS.\nMost cases reported in the recent past, however, still\ninvolve menstruating women under age 30. TSS stilloccurs in about 17 out of every 100,000 menstruatinggirls and women each year; more than half of these casesare related to tampons. Between five and 10% of patientswith TSS die.\nStreptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)\nA new type of toxic shock syndrome is caused by a\ndifferent bacteria, called Group A streptococcus. Thisform of TSS is called streptococcal toxic shock syn-drome, or STSS. Officially recognized in 1987, STSS isrelated to the strain of streptococcus nicknamed the“flesh-eating bacterium.” STSS affects only one or twoout of every 100,000 Americans. It almost never followsa simple “strep throat” infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nTransmission\nTSS is caused by a strain of Staphylococcus aureus\nfound in the nose, mouth, and occasionally the vagina.The bacteria produce a characteristic toxin. In largeenough quantities, the toxin can enter the bloodstream,causing a potentially fatal infection.\nWhile experts know the name of the bacterium,\nmore than 10 years after the 1980s epidemic scientistsstill do not fully understand the link between TSS andtampons. Most medical researchers today suspect thatthe absorbent tampons introduce oxygen into the vagina,which is normally an oxygen-free area of the body. Oxy-gen triggers bacterial growth, and the more absorbent thetampon, the more bacteria it can harbor. Some expertsbelieve that the reason TSS is linked to tampons in par-ticular is that bacteria can contaminate and multiply in atampon. If left in place for a long time—as a womancould do with a super-absorbent product—the bacteriahave a better chance of multiplying and producing a largeamount of toxin. It is also possible that the tampons orthe chemicals they contain may irritate the vaginal lining,enabling the toxin to enter the bloodstream.\nThese types of bacteria are normally present either\non hands or in the vagina, and it takes an amount of bac-teria only the size of a grain of sand to start an infection.Of the 15% of women who carry Staphylococcusaureus , only about 5% have the strain that produces the\nTSS toxin.\nSymptoms\nTSS. TSS begins suddenly, with a high fever of\n102°F (38.9°C) or above, vomiting and watery diarrhea,headache , and sunburn-like rash; together with a sore\nthroat and body aches. Blood pressure may plummet a\nday or two after the first symptoms appear. When theblood pressure drops, a woman may become disorientedor go into shock. Her kidneys may fail. After these devel-opments, the skin on her hands and feet may peel.\nSTSS. STSS can occur after a streptococcal infection\nin the body, usually from an infected wound or evenchickenpox . Within 48 hours, the patient’s blood pres-\nsure drops. There is also fever, dizziness , breathing prob-\nlems, and a weak, rapid pulse. The area around thewound may swell, the liver and kidneys can fail, andbleeding problems may occur.\nDiagnosis\nAny woman who is wearing a tampon and begins to\nexperience the symptoms of toxic shock syndrome shouldremove the tampon right away and seek medical care.\nThe doctor will probably examine the vagina for\nsigns of inflammation and rule out common sexually\ntransmitted diseases with similar symptoms. A variety\nof blood tests, tests of vaginal secretions, and a physical\nexamination are needed to identify this condition.\nTreatment\nTSS\nIn a menstruating woman, the vagina is first\ncleansed with an antiseptic solution to eliminate some ofthe bacteria that produce the toxin. TSS is treated withantibiotics , together with other drugs and fluids to lower\nfever and control blood pressure.\nSTSS\nAntibiotics are used to treat STSS. Surgery may be\nneeded to remove dead skin and muscle.\nPrognosis\nTSS lasts as long as three weeks, and has a tendency\nto recur. About a third of the women who are treated forTSS have it again within six months. In addition, TSScan affect the liver, kidneys, lungs, and other organs,depending on the severity of the infection. Untreatedtoxic shock syndrome can be fatal.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3347Toxic shock syndromePrevention\nTSS\nWomen who wear tampons should change them\noften and use different brands and types of pads and tam-pons. If a woman really prefers tampons, experts recom-mend using the lowest possible absorbency productmade of cotton and rayon, and wearing it only during theday. In the past, it was difficult to compare absorbencyrates for different products. Today, the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) requires standardized absorbencymeasurements on all tampon boxes. Above all, womenshould wash their hands before inserting a tampon, andchange the tampon every four to six hours.\nAnyone who has had TSS even once should not use\ntampons again.\nSTSS\nDoctors still are not sure how people can avoid\nSTSS, but they advise patients to clean and bandage openwounds immediately. Anyone with a red, swollen, or\ntender wound, or a sudden fever should seek medicalcare.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGarrett, Laurie. The Coming Plague. New York: Penguin\nBooks, 1994.\nTurkington, Carol A.

    "title": "Toxoplasmosis",
    "content": "Toxoplasmosis\nDefinition\nToxoplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by the\none-celled protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii .\nAlthough most individuals do not experience any symp-toms, the disease can be very serious, and even fatal, inindividuals with weakened immune systems.\nDescription\nToxoplasmosis is caused by a one-celled protozoan\nparasite known as Toxoplasma gondii . Cats, the primary\ncarriers of the organism, become infected by eatingrodents and birds infected with the organism. Onceingested, the organism reproduces in the intestines ofcats, producing millions of eggs known as oocysts, whichare excreted in cat feces daily for approximately twoweeks. In the United States, it is estimated that approxi-mately 30% of cats have been infected by T. gondii .\nOocysts are not capable of producing infection untilapproximately 24 hours after being excreted, but theyremain infective in water or moist soil for approximatelyone year. When cattle, sheep, or other livestock foragethrough areas with contaminated cat feces, these animalsbecome carriers of the disease. Fruits and vegetables canalso become contaminated when irrigated with untreatedwater that has been contaminated with cat feces. Inhumans and other animals, the organisms produce thick-walled, dormant structures called cysts in the muscle andother tissues of the body.\nMost humans contract toxoplasmosis by eating cyst-\ncontaminated raw or undercooked meat, vegetables, ormilk products. Humans can also become infected whenthey come into contact with the T. gondii eggs while\ncleaning a cat’s litterbox, gardening, or playing in a sand-box, for instance. Once infected, an individual is immuneto reinfection. The incubation period or period between\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3348Toxoplasmosisinfection and the start of the disease ranges from several\ndays to months.\nAnyone can be infected by T. gondii , but usually only\nthose individuals with weakened immune systems(immunocompromised) develop symptoms of the disease.For them, toxoplasmosis can be severe, debilitating, andfatal. Immunocompromised individuals at risk includethose with AIDS ,cancer , or other chronic illnesses.\nThere is no person-to-person transmission, except\nfrom an infected mother to her child in the womb.Approximately six out of 1,000 women contract toxo-plasmosis during pregnancy . Nearly half of these mater-\nnal infections are passed on to the fetus. Known as con-genital toxoplasmosis, this form of the disease isacquired at birth by approximately 3,300 infants in theUnited States every year. The risk of fetal infection isestimated to be between one in 1,000 to one in 10,000. Inchildren born with toxoplasmosis, symptoms may besevere and quickly fatal, or may not appear until severalmonths or even years after birth.\nCauses and symptoms\nHealthy individuals do not usually display symp-\ntoms. When symptoms do occur, they are usually mild,resembling infectious mononucleosis , and include the\nfollowing:\n• enlarged lymph nodes \n• muscle pains • fever that comes and goes \n• general sick feeling\nThe distinction is made between acquired toxoplas-\nmosis, in which an individual becomes infected, andneonatal congenital toxoplasmosis, in which a fetus isborn with the infection because the mother becameinfected during pregnancy. If a fetus becomes infectedearly in pregnancy, the disease can cause the fetus tospontaneously abort, be stillborn. If full-term, the infantmay die in infancy or suffer from central nervous systemlesions. If the mother becomes infected in the last threemonths of pregnancy, however, the prognosis is good andthe baby may not even display any symptoms.\nIn adults, if the infection continues for an extended\nperiod of time, chronic toxoplasmosis can cause an inflam-mation of the eyes called retinochoroiditis, which can leadto blindness, severe yellowing of the skin and whites of theeyes ( jaundice ), easy bruising, and convulsions.\nAdults with weakened immune systems have a high\nrisk of developing cerebral toxoplasmosis, includinginflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ), one-sided\nweakness or numbness, mood and personality changes,vision disturbances, muscle spasms, and severe\nheadaches. If untreated, cerebral toxoplasmosis can leadto coma and death . This form of encephalitis is the sec-\nond most common AIDS-related nervous system infec-tion that takes advantage of a person’s weakenedimmune system (opportunistic infection).\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is made based on clin-\nical signs and supporting laboratory results, includingvisualization of the protozoa in body tissue or isolation\nin animals and blood tests. Laboratory tests for toxoplas-mosis are designed to detect increased amounts of a pro-tein or antibody produced in response to infection withthe toxoplasmosis organism. Antibody levels can be ele-vated for years, however, without active disease.\nTreatment\nMost individuals who contract toxoplasmosis do not\nrequire treatment because their immune systems are ableto control the disease. Symptoms are not usually present.Mild symptoms may be relieved by taking over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol)\nand ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil). Sore throat lozenges and\nrest may also ease the symptoms.\nAlthough the treatment of women infected with tox-\noplasmosis during pregnancy is controversial, mostphysicians feel that treatment is justified. Transmissionof toxoplasmosis from the mother to the fetus may beprevented if the mother takes the antibiotic spiramycin.Later in a pregnancy, if the fetus has contracted the dis-ease, treatment with the antibiotic pyrimethamine (Dara-prim, Fansidar) or sulfonamides may be effective.\nBabies born with toxoplasmosis who show symptoms ofthe disease may be treated with pyrimethamine, the sulfadrug sulfadiazine (Microsulfon), and folinic acid (anactive form of folic acid ).\nAIDS patients who have not been infected may be\ngiven a drug called TMP/SMX (Bactrim or Septra) toprevent toxoplasmosis infection. To treat cases of toxo-plasmosis in immunocompromised AIDS patients, acombination of pyrimethamine and a sulfa-based drug,either sulfadiazine or clindamycin (Cleocin), have beenused together and can be effective in treating this disease.Other antibiotic combinations and dosing schedules arestill being investigated. Physicians have reported successin alleviating symptoms by using trimethoprim-sul-famethoxazole (Proloprim or Trimpex) or dapsone(DDS) plus pyrimethamine. These drugs can produceside effects, such as allergic reaction, itching ,rashes ,\nand nausea; and patients must be monitored closely.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3349ToxoplasmosisPrognosis\nThe prognosis is poor when congenital toxoplasmo-\nsis is acquired during the first three months of pregnancy.Afflicted children die in infancy or suffer damage to theircentral nervous systems that can result in physical andmental retardation . Infection later in pregnancy usually\nresults in only mild symptoms, if any. The prognosis foracquired toxoplasmosis in adults with strong immune sys-tems is excellent. The disease often disappears by itselfafter several weeks. However, the prognosis for immu-niodeficient patients is not as positive. These patientsoften relapse when treatment is stopped. The disease canbe fatal to all immunocompromised patients, especiallyAIDS patients, and particularly if not treated. As a result,immunocompromised patients are typically placed onanti-toxoplasmosis drugs for the rest of their lives.\nPrevention\nThere are no drugs that can eliminate T. gondii cysts\nin animal or human tissues. Humans can reduce their risksof developing toxoplasmosis by practicing the following:\n• freezing (to 10.4°F/–12°C) and cooking foods to an\ninternal temperature of 152°F/67°C will kill the cysts \n• practicing sanitary kitchen techniques, such as washing\nutensils and cutting boards that come into contact withraw meat \n• keeping pregnant women and children away from\nhousehold cats and cat litter \n• disposing of cat feces daily, because the oocysts do not\nbecome infective until after 24 hours \n• helping cats to remain free of infection by feeding them\ndry, canned, or boiled food and by discouraging hunt-ing and scavenging \n• washing hands after outdoor activities involving soil\ncontact and wearing gloves when gardening\nResources\nBOOKS\nConn’s Current Therapy, 1996.

Presently, glaucoma isa major cause of blindness in the United States If caughtearly, glaucoma-related blindness is easily prevented,However, since it does not produce symptoms until latein its cycle, periodic tests for the disease are necessary.\nGlaucoma is usually associated with an increase in\nthe pressure inside the eye. This increase occurs in frontof the iris in a fluid called the aqueous humor. Aqueoushumor is supposed to exit through tiny channels betweenthe iris and the cornea, in an area called the trabeculum.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3350TrabeculectomyWhen the trabeculum is blocked, pressure from the build\nup of aqueous humor either increases rapidly with con-siderable pain and redness, or, as in most cases, the pres-\nsure builds slowly with no symptoms until much of thevision is lost. Trabeculectomy is the last treatmentemployed for either type of glaucoma. It is used onlyafter medications and laser trabeculoplasty (less invasiveprocedure that uses a laser to open the blocked trabecu-lum) have failed to alleviate the pressure.\nDescription\nA trabeculectomy involves removing a tiny piece\nof the eyeball right at the place where the cornea con-nects to the sclera (the white part), and creating a flapto allow fluid to escape the anterior chamber withoutdeflating the eye. Along with that tiny piece of corneaand sclera comes a piece of the iris. The whole area iscalled the trabeculum. Fluid can then flow out onto thesurface of the eye and be absorbed by the conjunctiva,the transparent membrane that lines the sclera and theeyelids. Sometimes, an additional piece is taken out ofthe iris so that anterior chamber fluid can also flowbackward into the vitreous part of the eye. This proce-dure is called an iridectomy.\nPreparation\nThe procedure and its benefits and possible compli-\ncations are fully explained. Antiglaucoma drugs are pre-scribed before surgery.

    "title": "Tracheoesophageal fistula",
    "content": "Tracheoesophageal fistula\nDefinition\nTracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is commonly a\nbirth defect, with the trachea connected to the esophagus.In most cases, the esophagus is discontinuous, causingimmediate feeding difficulties. TEFs may develop inadult life, secondary to the invasion of cancer in the area.\nIn addition, TEFs may be deliberately constructed withsurgery to aid talking in a patient who has the larynxremoved (a laryngectomy ).\nDescription\nThe trachea, or windpipe, carries air to the lungs. The\nesophagus carries food to the stomach. Sometimes duringdevelopment, these two tubes do not separate completely,but remain connected by a short passage. When this hap-pens, air enters the gastrointestinal system, causing thebowels to distend, and mucus is breathed into the lungscausing aspiration pneumonia and breathing problems.\nMost tracheoesophageal fistulas are diagnosed when\na child is born. There are three types. In 85–90% of tra-cheoesophageal fistulas, the top part of the esophagusends in a blind sac, and the lower part inserts into the tra-chea. In the second type, the upper part of the esophagusis connected directly to the trachea, while the lower partends in a pouch. In a rare type of fistula called an H type,both the esophagus and trachea are complete, but theyare connected. This is the most difficult type of tracheoe-sophageal fistula to diagnose, because both eating andbreathing are possible.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3351Tracheoesophageal fistulaCauses and symptoms\nTracheoesophageal fistulas arise as a developmental\nabnormality. At birth, the infant has difficulty swallow-ing. Eating produces severe coughing spells that interferewith breathing. Aspiration pneumonia can develop fromfluid breathed into the lungs. \nSmall H type fistulas may go undiagnosed until later\nin life. Symptoms of an H type fistula include frequentpulmonary infections and bouts of abdominal bloating.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis that the esophagus is interrupted is con-\nfirmed by the inability to insert a nasogastric suction\ntube into the stomach. The exact type and location of thefistula can be determined using a radiopaque catheter,which allows pictures to be taken of the esophagus. Xrays may show air in the bowels. Endoscopy often failsto located the fistula if it is small.\nTreatment\nBabies with all but H type fistulas are unlikely to\nsurvive without surgical separation and repair of the tra-chea and the esophagus. Surgery cannot always be per-formed immediately because of prematurity , the pres-\nence of other birth defects , or complications from aspi-\nration pneumonia. It is usually done at a hospital that hasspecial facilities for treating seriously ill newborns.\nWhile awaiting surgery, the infant’s condition is sta-\nbilized. Preoperative care concentrates on avoiding aspi-ration pneumonia and includes:\n• elevating the head to avoid reflux and aspiration of the\nstomach contents \n• using a suction catheter to continuously removed\nmucus and saliva that could be inhaled\n• when necessary, placement of a gastrostomy tube\n• withholding feeding by mouth\nWhen surgery is performed, the esophagus is recon-\nnected to make it continuous and separate from the tra-chea. If the two ends of the esophagus are too far apart tobe reattached, a piece of tissue from the large intestine isused to join the parts.\nPrognosis\nInfants who have tracheoesophageal fistula often\nhave other birth defects that affect their recovery. Evenwhen the esophagus is successfully separated and reat-tached, many infants have difficulty swallowing, becausethe contractility of the esophagus is impaired.

    "content": "Tracheotomy\nDefinition\nA tracheotomy is a surgical procedure in which a cut\nor opening is made in the windpipe (trachea). The sur-geon inserts a tube into the opening to bypass an obstruc-tion, allow air to get to the lungs, or remove secretions.The term tracheostomy is sometimes used interchange-ably with tracheotomy. Strictly speaking, however, tra-cheostomy usually refers to the opening itself while a tra-cheotomy is the actual operation.\nPurpose\nA tracheotomy is performed if enough air is not get-\nting to the lungs, if the person cannot breathe without help,or is having problems with mucus and other secretions get-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3352Tracheotomyting into the windpipe because of difficulty swallowing.\nThere are many reasons why air cannot get to the lungs.The patient’s windpipe may be blocked by a swelling; by asevere injury to the neck, nose or mouth; by a large foreignobject; by paralysis of the throat muscles; or by a tumor.\nThe patient may be in a coma , or need a ventilator to pump\nair into the lungs for a long period of time.\nPrecautions\nDoctors perform emergency tracheotomies as last-\nresort procedures. They are done only if the patient’swindpipe is obstructed and the situation is life-threatening.\nDescription\nEmergency tracheotomy\nThere are two different procedures that are called tra-\ncheotomies. The first is done only in emergency situationsand can be performed quite rapidly. The emergency room\nphysician or surgeon makes a cut in a thin part of the voicebox (larynx) called the cricothyroid membrane. A tube isinserted and connected to an oxygen bag. This emergencyprocedure is sometimes called a cricothyroidotomy.\nNonemergency tracheotomy\nThe second type of tracheotomy takes more time and\nis usually done in an operating room. The surgeon firstmakes a cut (incision) in the skin of the neck that lies overthe trachea. This incision is in the lower part of the neckbetween the Adam’s apple and top of the breastbone. Theneck muscles are separated and the thyroid gland, whichoverlies the trachea, is usually cut down the middle. Thesurgeon identifies the rings of cartilage that make up thetrachea and cuts into the tough walls. A metal or plastictube, called a tracheotomy tube, is inserted through theopening. This tube acts like a windpipe and allows the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3353Tracheotomy\nThyroidMuscleTrachea\nTreacheotomy \ntube insertedSuturesLarynx\nSubcutaneous \ntissuesFigure A\nFigure D Figure E Figure FFigure B Figure C\nThyroid \nisthmusThyroid \nisthmus\nRetractor\nTracheotomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made in the windpipe or trachea. As shown in the illustration\nabove, the physician or surgeon will follow these steps in performing this procedure: Figure A: A vertical incision is madethrough the skin.

Oxygen or a mechanical ventilator may\nbe hooked up to the tube to bring oxygen to the lungs. Adressing is placed around the opening. Tape or stitches(sutures) are used to hold the tube in place.\nAfter a nonemergency tracheotomy, the patient usu-\nally stays in the hospital for three to five days, unlessthere is a complicating condition. It takes about twoweeks to recover fully from the surgery.\nPreparation\nEmergency tracheotomy\nIn the emergency tracheotomy, there is no time to\nexplain the procedure or the need for it to the patient. Thepatient is placed on his or her back with face upward(supine), with a rolled-up towel between the shoulders.This positioning of the patient makes it easier for thedoctor to feel and see the structures in the throat. A localanesthetic is injected across the cricothyroid membrane.\nNonemergency tracheotomy\nIn a nonemergency tracheotomy, there is time for the\ndoctor to discuss the surgery with the patient, to explainwhat will happen and why it is needed. The patient isthen put under general anesthesia. The neck area andchest are then disinfected as preparation for the opera-tion, and surgical drapes are placed over the area, settingup a sterile field.\nAftercare\nPostoperative care\nA chest x ray is often taken, especially in children, to\ncheck whether the tube has become displaced or if compli-cations have occurred. The doctor may prescribe antibi-\notics to reduce the risk of infection. If the patient can\nbreathe on their own, the room is humidified; otherwise, ifthe tracheotomy tube is to remain in place, the air enteringthe tube from a ventilator is humidified. During the hospi-tal stay, the patient and his or her family members willlearn how to care for the tracheotomy tube, including suc-tioning and clearing it. Secretions are removed by passinga smaller tube (catheter) into the tracheotomy tube.\nIt takes most patients several days to adjust to\nbreathing through the tracheotomy tube. At first, it willbe hard even to make sounds. If the tube allows some airto escape and pass over the vocal cords, then the patientmay be able to speak by holding a finger over the tube. Apatient on a ventilator will not be able to talk at all.\nThe tube will be removed if the tracheotomy is tem-\nporary. Then the wound will heal quickly and only asmall scar may remain. If the tracheotomy is permanent,the hole stays open and, if it is no longer needed, it will\nbe surgically closed.\nHome care\nAfter the patient is discharged, he or she will need\nhelp at home to manage the tracheotomy tube. Warmcompresses can be used to relieve pain at the incision\nsite. The patient is advised to keep the area dry. It is rec-ommended that the patient wear a loose scarf over theopening when going outside. He or she should also avoidcontact with water, food particles, and powdery sub-stances that could enter the opening and cause seriousbreathing problems. The doctor may prescribe pain med-ication and antibiotics to minimize the risk of infections.If the tube is to be kept in place permanently, the patientcan be referred to a speech therapist in order to learn tospeak with the tube in place. The tracheotomy tube maybe replaced four to 10 days after surgery.\nPatients are encouraged to go about most of their\nnormal activities once they leave the hospital. Vigorousactivity is restricted for about six weeks. If the tracheoto-my is permanent, further surgery may be needed towiden the opening, which narrows with time.\nRisks\nImmediate risks\nThere are several short-term risks associated with\ntracheotomies. Severe bleeding is one possible complica-tion. The voice box or esophagus may be damaged dur-ing surgery. Air may become trapped in the surroundingtissues or the lung may collapse. The tracheotomy tubecan be blocked by blood clots, mucus, or the pressure ofthe airway walls. Blockages can be prevented by suction-ing, humidifying the air, and selecting the appropriatetracheotomy tube. Serious infections are rare.\nLong-term risks\nOver time, other complications may develop follow-\ning a tracheotomy. The windpipe itself may becomedamaged for a number of reasons, including pressurefrom the tube; bacteria that cause infections and formscar tissue; or friction from a tube that moves too much.Sometimes the opening does not close on its own afterthe tube is removed. This risk is higher in tracheotomieswith tubes remaining in place for 16 weeks or longer. Inthese cases, the wound is surgically closed.\nHigh-risk groups\nThe risks associated with tracheotomies are higher\nin the following groups of patients:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3354Tracheotomy• children, especially newborns and infants\n• smokers\n• alcoholics\n• obese adults\n• persons over 60\n• persons with chronic diseases or respiratory infections• persons taking muscle relaxants , sleeping medica-\ntions, tranquilizers, or cortisone\nThe overall risk of death from a tracheotomy is less\nthan 5%.\nNormal results\nNormal results include uncomplicated healing of the\nincision and successful maintenance of long-term tubeplacement.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFagan, Johannes J., et al.

    "content": "Trachoma\nDefinition\nTrachoma, which is also called granular conjunc-\ntivitis or Egyptian ophthalmia, is a contagious, chronic\ninflammation of the mucous membranes of the eyes,caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . It is characterized by\nswelling of the eyelids, sensitivity to light, and eventualscarring of the conjunctivae and corneas of the eyes.\nDescription\nTrachoma is a major cause of blindness in the world.\nIt is found in the Far East, as well as countries withdesert climates. In the United States, it is most commonamong certain Native Americans and in parts ofAppalachia. The infection is highly contagious in itsearly stages. Blindness results from recurrent untreatedinfections.\nThe conjunctiva is the clear mucous membrane that\nlines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part(sclera) of the eye. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation ofthe conjunctiva. \nCauses and symptoms\nTrachoma is caused by C. trachomatis , a parasitic\norganism closely related to bacteria. It is transmitted byinsects, by hand-to-eye contact, or by the sharing ofinfected handkerchiefs or towels. The incubation periodis about a week.\nThe early symptoms of trachoma include the devel-\nopment of follicles (small sacs) on the conjunctivae ofthe upper eyelids, pain , swollen eyelids, a discharge,\ntearing, and sensitivity to light. If the infection is nottreated, the follicles develop into large yellow or graypimples, and small blood vessels develop inside thecornea. In most cases, both eyes are infected.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3355TrachomaRepeated infections eventually lead to contraction\nand turning-in of the eyelids, scarring of the corneas andconjunctivae, eventual blockage of the tear ducts, andblindness.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on a combination of the patient’s\nhistory (especially living or traveling in areas with highrates of trachoma) and examination of the eyes. The doc-tor will look for the presence of follicles or scarring. Heor she will take a small sample of cells from the patient’sconjunctivae and examine them, following a procedurecalled Giemsa staining, to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment of early-stage trachoma consists of four\nto six weeks of antibiotic treatment with tetracycline,erythromycin, or sulfonamides . Antibiotics should be\ngiven without waiting for laboratory test results. Treat-ment may combine oral medication with antibiotic oint-ment applied directly to the eyes. A single-dose treat-ment with azithromycin is an alternative method. Tetra-\ncyclines should not be given to pregnant women or chil-\ndren below the age of seven years.\nPatients with complications from untreated or\nrepeated infections are treated surgically. Surgery can beused for corneal transplantation or to correct eyelid\ndeformities.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for full recovery is excellent if the\npatient is treated promptly. If the infection has pro-gressed to the stage of follicle development, preventionKEY TERMS\nConjunctivitis —Inflammation of the conjunctivae,\nwhich are the mucous membranes covering thewhite part of the eyeball (sclera) and lining theinside of the eyelids.\nCornea —The transparent front part of the eye that\nallows light to enter.\nOphthalmia —Inflammation of the eye. Usually\nsevere and affecting the conjunctiva. Trachoma issometimes called Egyptian ophthalmia.\nof blindness depends on the severity of the follicles, the\npresence of additional bacterial infections, and the devel-opment of scarring.\nPrevention\nThere are vaccines available that offer temporary\nprotection against trachoma, but there is no permanentimmunization. Prevention depends upon good hygieneand public health measures:\n• seek treatment immediately if a child shows signs of\neye infection, and minimize his or her contact withother children\n• teach children to wash hands carefully before touching\ntheir eyes\n• protect children from flies or gnats that settle around\nthe eyes\n• if someone has trachoma (or any eye infection), do not\nshare towels, pillowcases, etc.; wash items well\n• if medications are prescribed, follow the doctor’s\ninstructions carefully\nResources\nBOOKS\nO’Brien, Terrence P. “Conjunctivitis.” In Conn’s Current Ther-\napy, 1996 , ed.

It is used to treat frac-\ntures , dislocations, and long-duration muscle spasms,\nand to prevent or correct deformities. Traction can eitherbe short-term, as at an accident scene, or long-term,when it is used in a hospital setting.\nTraction serves several purposes:\n• it aligns the ends of a fracture by pulling the limb into a\nstraight position\n• it ends muscle spasm\n• it relieves pain• it takes the pressure off the bone ends by relaxing the\nmuscle\nThere are two main types of traction: skin traction and\nskeletal traction. Within these types, many specializedforms of traction have been developed to address problemsin particular parts of the body. The application of tractionis an exacting technique that requires training and experi-ence, since incorrectly applied traction can cause harm.\nPositioning the extremity so that the angle of pull\nbrings the ends of the fracture together is essential. Elab-orate methods of weights, counterweights, and pulleyshave been developed to provide the appropriate forcewhile keeping the bones aligned and preventing musclespasm. The patient’s age, weight, and medical conditionare all taken into account when deciding on the type anddegree of traction.\nPrecautions\nPeople who are suffering from skin disorders or who\nare allergic to tape should not undergo skin traction,because the application of traction will aggravate theircondition. Likewise, circulatory disorders or varicose\nveins can be aggravated by skin traction. People with an\ninflammation of the bone ( osteomyelitis ) should not\nundergo skeletal traction. \nDescription\nSkin traction\nSkin traction uses five- to seven-pound weights\nattached to the skin to indirectly apply the necessarypulling force on the bone. If traction is temporary, or ifonly a light or discontinuous force is needed, then skintraction is the preferred treatment. Because the proce-dure is not invasive, it is usually performed in a hospi-tal bed.\nWeights are attached either through adhesive or non-\nadhesive tape, or with straps, boots, or cuffs. Care mustbe taken to keep the straps or tape loose enough to pre-vent swelling and allow good circulation to the part ofthe limb beyond the spot where the traction is applied.The amount of weight that can be applied through skintraction is limited because excessive weight will irritatethe skin and cause it to slough off.\nSpecialized forms of skin traction have been devel-\noped to address specific problems. Dunlop’s traction isused on children with certain fractures of the upperarm, when the arm must be kept in a flexed position toprevent problems with the circulation and nervesaround the elbow. Pelvic traction is applied to the lowerspine, with a belt around the waist. Buck’s skin tractionis used to treat knee injuries other than fractures. Thepurpose of this traction is to stabilize the knee andreduce muscle spasm.\nSkeletal traction\nSkeletal traction is performed when more pulling\nforce is needed than can be withstood by skin traction; orwhen the part of the body needing traction is positionedso that skin traction is impossible. Skeletal traction usesweights of 25-40 pounds.\nSkeletal traction requires the placement of tongs,\npins, or screws into the bone so that the weight is applieddirectly to the bone. This is an invasive procedure that isdone in an operating room under general, regional, orlocal anesthesia.\nCorrect placement of the pins is essential to the suc-\ncess of the traction. The pin can be kept in place severalmonths, and must be kept clean to prevent infection.Once the hardware is in place, pulleys and weights areattached to wires to provide the proper pull and align-ment on the affected part.\nSpecialized forms of skeletal traction include cervi-\ncal traction used for fractures of the neck vertebrae; over-head arm traction used for certain types of upper armfractures; and tibia pin traction used for some fractures ofthe femur, hip, or pelvis.\nPreparation\nX rays are done prior to the application of both\nforms of traction, and may be repeated during treatmentto assure that the affected parts are staying in alignment\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3357Tractionand healing properly. Since the insertion of the anchoring\ndevices in skeletal traction is a surgical procedure, stan-dard preoperative blood and urine testing are done, andthe patient may meet with an anesthesiologist to discussany health conditions that might affect the administrationof anesthesia. \nAftercare\nAftercare for skin traction involves making sure the\nlimb stays aligned, and caring for the skin so that it doesnot become sore and irritated. The patient should also bealert to any swelling or tingling in the limb that wouldsuggest that the limb has been wrapped too tightly. \nAftercare for skeletal traction is more complex.\nThe patient is likely to be immobile for an extendedperiod. Deep breathing exercises are taught so that res-piratory function is maintained during this time of littleactivity. Patients are also encouraged to do range-ofmotion exercises with the unaffected parts of the body.The patient is taught how to use a trapeze (an overheadsupport bar) to shift on and off a bedpan, since it is notpossible to get up to use the toilet. In serious injuries,traction may be continued for several months until heal-\ning is complete.\nRisks\nThe main risks associated with skin traction are that\nthe traction will be applied incorrectly and cause harm,or that the skin will become irritated. There are morerisks associated with skeletal traction. Bone inflamma-tion may occur in response to the introduction of foreignmaterial into the body. Infection can occur at the pinsites. If caught early, infection can be treated with antibi-\notics , but if severe, it may require removal of the pin.\nBoth types of traction have complications associated\nwith long periods of immobility. These include the devel-opment of bed sores, reduced respiratory function, uri-nary problems, and circulatory problems. Occasionally,fractures fail to heal. Being confined to traction for a longperiod can take a an emotional toll on the patient, also.\nNormal results\nWhen correctly applied, traction generally produces\nvery good, if slow, results.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3358Traction\nSimple traction\nGallows traction Balanced skeletal tractionHamilton Russell traction\nTraction refers to the usage of a pulling force and special devices, such as a cast or splint, to treat muscle and skeletal disor -\nders.

    "title": "Traditional Chinese medicine",
    "content": "Traditional Chinese medicine\nDefinition\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an ancient\nand still very vital holistic system of health and healing,based on the notion of harmony and balance, andemploying the ideas of moderation and prevention.\nPurpose\nTCM is a complete system of health-care with its\nown unique theories of anatomy, health, and treatment. Itemphasizes diet and prevention and using acupuncture ,\nherbal medicine, massage, and exercise ; and focuses on\nstimulating the body’s natural curative powers.\nPrecautions\nIn situations of severe trauma, TCM should not be\nsubstituted for contemporary modern trauma practice; itis most useful as an adjunct to the healing regimen. TCMis not the first line of treatment for bacterial infection orcancer , but may usefully complement contemporary\nmedical treatment for those conditions.\nDescription\nIn theory and practice, traditional Chinese medicine\nis completely different from Western medicine, both interms of considering how the human body works andhow illness occurs and should be treated. As a part of acontinuing system that has been in use for thousands ofyears, it is still employed to treat over one-quarter of theworld’s population. Since the earliest Chinese physicianswere also philosophers, their ways of viewing the worldand human beings’ role in it affected their medicine. InTCM, both philosophically and medically, moderation inall things is advocated, as is living in harmony withnature and striving for balance in all things. Prevention isalso a key goal of Chinese medicine, and much emphasisis placed on educating the patient to live responsibly. TheChinese physician also is more of an advisor than anauthority; he or she believes in treating every patient dif-ferently, based on the notion that one does not treat thedisease or condition but rather the individual patient.Thus two people with the same complaint may be treatedentirely differently, if their constitutions and life situa-tions are dissimilar. Disease is also considered to be evi-dence of the failure of preventive health care and afalling out of balance or harmony.\nThere is some confusion in the West about the fun-\ndamental philosophical principles upon which tradition-al Chinese medicine is based — such as the concept ofyin and yang, the notion of five elements (wood, fire,earth, metal and water), and the concept of chi— yet\neach can be explained in a way that is understandable toWesterners.\nYin and yang describe the interdependent relation-\nship of opposing but complementary forces believed tobe necessary for a healthy life. Basically, the goal is tomaintain a balance of yin and yang in all things.\nThe five elements, or five-phase theory, is also\ngrounded in the notion of harmony and balance. The con-cept of chi,which means something like “life force” or\n“energy,” is perhaps most different from Western ideas.TCM asserts that chiis an invisible energy force that\nflows freely in a healthy person, but is weakened orblocked when a person is ill. Specifically, the illness is aresult of the blockage, rather than the blockage being theresult of the illness.\nBesides these philosophical concepts that differ con-\nsiderably from infection-based principles of medicineand health, the methods employed by traditional Chinese\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3359Traditional Chinese medicine\nChinese medicine practitioner preparing herbal medicines.\n(Photograph by Eric Nelson. Custom Medical Stock Photo, Inc.Reproduced by permission.)medicine are also quite different. If allopathic Western\npractitioners could be described as interventionist anddependent on synthetic pharmaceuticals, TCM methodsare mostly natural and noninvasive. For example, whereWestern physicians might employ surgery and chemo-\ntherapy or radiation for a cancer patient, a TCM physi-\ncian might use acupuncture and dietary changes. TCMbelieves in “curing the root” of a disease and not merelyin treating its symptoms.\nAnother major difference is how the patient is\nregarded. In Western medicine, patients with similarcomplaints or diseases, usually will receive virtually thesame treatment. In TCM however, the physician treatsthe patient and not the condition, believing that identicaldiseases can have entirely different causes. In terms ofthe principles upon which it is based and the methodsused, traditional Chinese medicine, therefore, is consid-ered by many in the West to be a radically different sys-tem of healthcare.\nTo some in the Western world, this very strangeness\nis the reason why it might be attractive. To others, tiredof what they perceive as their physician’s perfunctory,analytical, and sometimes cold manner, TCM offers amore humane, patient-oriented approach that encouragesa high degree of practitioner-patient interaction and isnot overly dependent on technology.\nFor example, during a consultation with a TCM\npractitioner, the patient will receive a considerableamount of time and attention. During the important firstvisit, the practitioner will conduct four types of examina-tions, all extremely observational and all quite differentfrom what patients usually experience. \nFirst, the practitioner will ask many questions,\ngoing beyond the typical patient history to inquire aboutsuch particulars as eating and bowel habits or sleep pat-terns. Next, the physician looks at the patient, observinghis or her complexion and eyes, while also examiningthe tongue very closely, believing that it is a barometerof the body’s health and that different areas of thetongue can reflect the functioning of different bodyorgans. After observing, they listen to the patient’s voiceor cough and then smell his or her breath, body odor,\nurine, and even bowel movements. Finally, the practi-tioner touches the patient, palpating his or her abdomenand feeling the wrist to take up to six different pulses. Itis through these different pulses that the well-trainedpractitioner can diagnose any problem with the flow ofthe all-important chi. Altogether, this essentially obser-\nvational examination will lead the physician to diagnoseor decide the patient’s problem. This diagnosis is verydifferent from one in contemporary Western medicine.No blood or urine samples are tested in a laboratory. Thekey to this technique lies in the experience and skill of\nthe practitioner.\nAfter making a diagnosis, the physician will suggest\na course of treatment from one or all of the availableTCM methods. These fall into four main categories:herbal medicine, acupuncture, dietary therapy, and mas-sage and exercise. A typical TCM prescription consistsof a complex variety of many different herbal and miner-al ingredients. Chinese herbal remedies are intended toassist the body’s own systems so that eventually thepatient can stop taking them and never becomes depen-dent on them. Herbal formulas are usually given as teas,which differ according to the patient. \nOther common techniques used in a TCM prescrip-\ntion are as follows:\n• Acupuncture is based on the notion that the body’s vital\nenergy force, chi, travels through known channels or\n“meridians.” The acupuncturist inserts tiny, thin sterileneedles at particular, selected points on the body tounblock or correct the flow of energy. These needles arehardly felt as they are inserted and are left in place for15–20 minutes. Some patients report immediateimprovement, others feel exhilarated, while some feellike sleeping. In some cases, patients say their conditionworsens before it improves. No contemporary scientificexplanation exists as to how or why acupuncture works. \n• Moxibustion is a variation sometimes employed. Moxi-\nbustion is the slow burning on or over the body of spe-cial herbal “cones.” These are placed on specific acu-points and provide penetrating, relaxing heat. \n• Massage is often recommended, and a deep finger pres-\nsure technique known as acupressure is often used to\npromote the proper flow of chi. \n• Diet is considered essential to good health, and what\nmight be called “kitchen medicine” is just another aspectof herbalism. One example is a delicious dong quai\nblack bean soup that is traditionally eaten by women inChina after childbirth and each menstrual cycle. \n• Therapeutic exercises are sometimes prescribed as\nwell. In both the exact and flowing movements of t’ai\nchi, and the breathing techniques of Qi Dong exercise\nis considered essential to relieving stress and promot-\ning the smooth flow of chi.\nAs a system of total healthcare, TCM is prepared to\ndeal with any physical or mental problem, condition, ordisease. However, unlike Western medicine at its best,TCM is not able to render the kind of emergency crisisintervention that saves lives during physical traumas.Nonetheless, it works best at achieving its goal of prac-ticing preventive medicine. It has proven effective intreating many types of aches and pains and in helping\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3360Traditional Chinese medicinepeople with depression and fatigue , as well as circula-\ntion and digestive problems. Overall, its emphasis ongood diet and exercise, as well as on individual responsi-bility and moderation in all things, suggest that it isgrounded in fundamentally sound principles.\nRisks\nIn the hands of a qualified practitioner, TCM is very\nsafe. However, there is a small chance of not only gettingan infection from acupuncture, but also that an existinginfection could be spread to other parts of the body byincreased blood flow and circulation.\nNormal results\nTraditional Chinese medicine seeks to harmonize\nand rebalance the entire human system rather than totreat just symptoms. Since proper internal balance is con-sidered to be the key to human health, TCM strives tocure disease by restoring that balance and thereforeallowing the body to repair itself. Its continuing medicalgoal is to detect and correct abnormalities before theycause permanent physical damage.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEckert, Achim. Chinese Medicine for Beginners.

Bruno, PhD\nTrager psychophysical\nintegration\nDefinition\nTrager psychophysical integration therapy, also\nknown as the Tragerwork system of physical integration,is a combination of hands-on tissue mobilization, relax-ation, and movement reeducation called Mentastics. Theunderlying principle of psychophysical integration isthat clients learn to be lighter, easier, and freer by expe-riencing lightness, ease, and freedom of movement intheir bodies.\nThe Trager method is a psychologically grounded\nphysical approach to muscle relaxation, which is inducedwhen a practitioner and patient achieve a state of mindcalled hook-up. Hook-up is described as a connection toa state of grace or a powerful and nourishing life force. Itis the opposite of strain or effort.\nPurpose\nPsychophysical integration therapy has been helpful\nin relieving muscle discomfort in patients afflicted withpolio ,muscular dystrophy ,Parkinson’s disease ,mul-\ntiple sclerosis , post-stroke trauma, and psychiatric dis-\nturbances. The therapy is useful in alleviating suchchronic conditions as back and leg pain . Athletes may\nbenefit from this system to increase resilience to injuriesand to improve their mental attitudes. In addition, theTrager Institute maintains that Tragerwork helps clientsachieve greater mental clarity through the release of“deep-seated physical and mental patterns.”\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3361Trager psychophysical integrationDescription\nOrigins\nPsychophysical integration therapy began with Dr.\nMilton Trager (1909–1997), who earned a medical degreein midlife after working out his approach to healing chronicpain. Trager was born with a spinal deformity and over-came it through practicing a variety of athletic exercises. Atthe time that he discovered his approach to bodywork, hewas training to become a boxer. His therapy came to publicattention when Esalen Institute in California, the famouscenter of the human potential movement, invited him togive a demonstration of his technique during the mid-1970s. Trager abandoned his private medical practice in1977 to devote full energy to the development and furtherunderstanding of psychophysical integration. The TragerInstitute, which continues his work, was founded in 1980.\nThe Trager method consists of two parts, a passive\naspect referred to as tablework and an active aspectcalled Mentastics, which is a self-care exercise program.\nAlthough the benefits of the Trager approach are said toMILTON TRAGER (1909–1997)\nMilton Trager was a medical doctor and a somatic\neducator, specializing in body learning. He was a con-temporary of F. Matthias Alexander, Moshe Feldenkrais,and Ida Rolf.\nAs a young man in the 1920s, he occupied himself\nwith gymnastics and boxing. Through his intensely phys-ical pursuits, he arrived at his self-taught body learningtheories. The techniques that he nurtured emphasizedbody control over strength, prowess, and endurance. Forexample, in striving to leap as high as possible, Tragerfocused his concentration on landing as softly as possi-ble. He obtained a degree in physical medicine beforeserving in the military during World War II.\nUpon his return, Trager funded his medical school\neducation with his GI benefits. He established a privatepractice and spent the ensuing 50 years refining his bodylearning techniques and assisting afflicted individuals inthe process. When Trager’s father was stricken with sciat-ic pain, Trager learned to relieve the spasms by hand. Intime he learned to alleviate the symptoms of polio vic-tims and others who suffered from muscle spasms.\nTrager established the Trager Institute in the 1970s\nto propagate the techniques that he had developed. Bythe year 2000, an estimated 2,000 students and practi-tioners had embraced the Trager Approach.\nTrager lived with his wife, Emily, in Southern Cali-\nfornia at the time of his death in January 1997.be cumulative, practitioners and clients appear to be free\nto set their own schedules for a series of sessions. Thereis no minimum number of sessions that clients mustagree to take.\nTablework\nThe tablework is performed on a comfortable\npadded table. Sessions last about 60–90 minutes. Thepractitioner moves the client in ways that he or she natu-rally moves, in such a way that he or she experienceshow it feels to move effortlessly and freely on one’s own.The movements resemble general mobilization tech-niques, and incorporate some manual, cervical, and lum-bar traction . The goal of tablework is to allow the client\n“slowly to give up muscular and mental control and sinkinto a very deep state of relaxation not unlike that experi-enced in hypnosis.”\nMentastics\nMentastics are free-flowing dance-like movements\nintended to increase the client’s self-awareness, as wellas providing tools to help the client move through andcontrol chronic pain. The client is encouraged to “let go,”which means that they are asked to begin a movement,then release their muscle tension and allow the weight ofthe body part involved to complete the motion. By expe-riencing movement as something pleasurable and posi-tive rather than painful or negative, clients begin toloosen up, learn new movements more easily, and evenbegin inventing their own. In the early stages of treat-ment, clients are advised to do Mentastic movements athome for 10–15-minute sessions, three times per day.\nPreparations\nPrior to a session of tablework, the client dresses for\ncomfort, “with a minimum of swimwear or briefs,”according to the Trager Institute. The client is also cov-ered with a drape. No oils or lotions are used.\nThe practitioner prepares for the session by clearing\nhis or her mind of everything but the client, until he or sheachieves a state of hook-up. This attitude of “relaxed med-itative awareness” on the part of the practitioner is one ofthe unique features of Tragerwork. It is described as allow-ing the therapist “to connect deeply with the recipient inan unforced way and enables the practitioner to perceivethe slightest responses from the [client’s] body.”\nPrecautions\nBecause of the unusual sensitivity and heightened\nawareness that is associated with the practitioner’s touch,pain should never result from tablework sessions. It isimportant for clients to alert the practitioner to any pain\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3362Trager psychophysical integrationassociated with either the tablework or the Mentastics\nprogram.\nAlthough the movements used in Trager tablework\nare gentle and noninvasive, clients who have had recentinjuries or surgery should wait to heal before undertakinga course of Tragerwork.\nSide effects\nThe Trager method should not produce physical side\neffects when employed by a qualified practitioner. It ispossible that some clients may have emotional reactionsassociated with the release of physical patterns acquiredas a response to trauma, but such reactions are unusual.\nResearch and general acceptance\nTragerwork, like other forms of bodywork, has gained\nincreasing acceptance as a form of treatment since the1980s. In 2000 there were 1,200 certified psychophysicalintegration practitioners in 15 countries worldwide. Thetherapy has been reported as a commonly employed treat-ment for mainstream athletes. In addition, the NationalInstitutes of Health lists psychophysical therapy as a mind-body form of complementary alternative medicine.\nResources\nBOOKS\nJuhan, Deanne. Job’s Body.

This flowmaintains the high rate of metabolism necessary for thebrain to function. Restrictions in blood flow may occurfrom vessel narrowing (stenosis), clot formation (throm-bosis), blockage ( embolism ), or blood vessel rupture\n(hemorrhage). Lack of sufficient blood flow ( ischemia )\nthreatens brain tissue and may cause a stroke .\nThe flow of blood through the arteries in the brain\ncan be analyzed using transcranial Doppler ultrasonogra-phy (TCD). TCD is a form of ultrasound, in which highfrequency sound waves bounce off or pass through bodytissues. While most other types of ultrasonography createimages of the tissue being studied, the results of TCD areaudible sounds that the examiner listens to and records.\nDoppler ultrasonography uses what is called the\nDoppler effect to measure the rate and direction of bloodflow in the vessels. Just as a siren’s pitch sounds higherwhen its source is moving toward you and lower as itmoves away, so too will ultrasound waves change pitch,or frequency, as they bounce off the red blood cells mov-ing in the blood. It is these pitch changes that produce theaudible sounds during the exam.\nChanges in frequency can be used to measure both\nthe direction and the speed of blood flow. Faster bloodflow causes a greater change in frequency. Combinedwith other tests, this information can be used to locaterestrictions in the blood vessels in the brain, and to track\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3363Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographychanges in blood flow over time. In this way, TCD gives\nvaluable information about the site of a stroke and thepatient’s progress after a stroke. TCD is also used toevaluate the contraction of blood vessels that can occur ifa blood vessel ruptures.\nPrecautions\nUltrasonography procedures are safe, noninvasive,\nand painless. No special precautions are necessary.\nDescription\nTCD is done with either one or two probes placed\nagainst the skin. The examiner spreads a clear gel onthe areas of the head where the probe will be placed.Usually, the probes are placed on the temple, on thebase of the skull at the back of the neck, and over theclosed eyelid. In these places, there is the least amountof thick protective bone and the sound waves can pene-trate the best. The examiner adjusts the probe positionand orientation to direct the sound waves toward theblood vessels of interest. Finding the best approachmay take some time. A compression test may be per-formed during the exam. In this test, the main artery inthe neck (carotid artery) is briefly compressed, andchanges in blood flow patterns are observed. A fullTCD exam may last 30–45 minutes, and often longer inpatients with disease.\nPreparation\nNo special preparation is needed. The patient should\nremove contact lenses, and may wish to avoid the use ofeye makeup, since the gel is likely to smear it.\nAftercare\nThe gel is washed off with soap and water. No other\nafter care is needed.\nRisks\nTCD is noninvasive and has no risks. A compression\ntest is occasionally, though very rarely, hazardous for apatient with narrowed arteries ( atherosclerosis ), since\nthe increased pressure may dislodge a piece of the sub-stance that causes the narrowing (plaque).\nNormal results\nTCD produces an audible sound that varies with the\nheartbeat. It also varies depending on the direction andrate of flow through the vessel being examined. Each ofthe vessels in the brain has a characteristic direction offlow, which can be detected by TCD. Flow rates are\nsomewhat variable from person to person.\nAbnormal results\nLack of flow indicates a vessel has been completely\nblocked (although absence of a signal may also be due toabsorption of sound waves by bone). If blood flows inthe wrong direction or alternates between normal andreverse flow, it may mean there is a blockage elsewhere.This happens because blood is rerouted due to abnormal-ities in pressure caused by the blockage.\nIf the speed of flow is increased, it may mean that\nblood is flowing through a restricted area that is just“upstream” from the probe. Intuitively, one might thinkthat a restricted blood vessel would cause the speed ofblood flow to slow down. However, the opposite is true.This is because the same amount of blood going througha narrower opening must go faster. Increased speed isalso seen if a vessel is carrying rerouted blood.\nResources\nBOOKS\nOffice Practice of Neurology. Ed. Martin Samuels and Steven\nFeske.

A tube with adevice called a transducer is passed down into thepatient’s throat and into the esophagus (the food tube thatconnects the mouth to the stomach). The transducerdirects ultrasound waves into the heart, and the reflectedsound waves picked up by the transducer are translatedinto an image of the heart.\nPurpose\nSince the esophagus is right next to the heart, trans-\nesophageal echocardiography provides a very clear pic-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3364Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographyture of the heart. It can provide information on the size of\nthe heart, its pumping strength, and the location andextent of any damage to its tissues. It can detect abnor-mal tissue growth around the heart valves. It is also goodat detecting abnormalities in the pattern of blood flow,such as the backward flow of blood through partly closedheart valves, known as regurgitation or insufficiency. It isespecially useful in cases in which conventional echocar-diography (a test where the transducer is kept on thepatient’s chest) cannot offer a good image, such as whenthe patient is obese or has a thick chest wall. It is usefulfor monitoring heart function during cardiac surgery anddetecting blood clots in the left atrium of the heart.\nPrecautions\nPatients should avoid consuming alcohol for a day\nor so before the procedure, since alcohol may amplifythe effects of the sedative used with the procedure.\nDescription\nEchocardiography creates an image of the heart\nusing ultra-high-frequency sound waves—sound wavesthat are much too high in frequency to be heard by thehuman ear. The technique is very similar to ultrasoundscanning commonly used to visualize the fetus duringpregnancy .\nA transesophageal echocardiography examination\ngenerally lasts 30–60 minutes. The patient is given amild sedative and the back of the throat is sprayed with alocal anesthetic, in order to suppress the gag reflex. Next,a special viewing tube called an endoscope, containing atiny transducer, is passed through the mouth and into theesophagus. It is carefully moved until it is positioneddirectly next to the heart. Essentially a modified micro-phone, the transducer directs ultrasound waves into theheart, some of which get reflected (or “echoed”) back tothe transducer. Different tissues and blood all reflectultrasound waves differently. These sound waves can betranslated into a meaningful image of the heart, which isdisplayed on a monitor or recorded on paper or tape. Thetransducer may be moved several times during the test tohelp doctors get a better view of the heart.\nPreparation\nThe patient may be given a mild sedative before the\nprocedure, and an anesthetic is sprayed into the back ofthe throat in order to suppress the gag reflex.\nAftercare\nAfter the test, it is important to refrain from eating\nor drinking until the gag reflex has returned—other-wise, the patient may accidentally inhale some of the\nfood or beverage. If a sedative has been given, patientsshould not drive or operate heavy machinery for atleast 10-12 hours. They should avoid consuming alco-hol for a day or so, since alcohol may amplify theeffect of the sedative.\nRisks\nTransesophageal echocardiography may cause gag-\nging and discomfort when the transducer is passed downinto the throat. Patients may also experience sore throat\nfor a few days after the test. In rare cases, the proceduremay cause bleeding or perforation of the esophagus or aninflammatory condition known as infective endocarditis .\nThe patient may have an adverse reaction to the sedativeor local anesthetic.\nNormal results\nA normal transesophageal echocardiogram shows a\nnormal heart structure and the normal flow of bloodthrough the heart chambers and heart valves.\nAbnormal results\nA transesophageal echocardiogram may show a\nnumber of abnormalities in the structure and function ofthe heart, such as thickening of the wall of the heartmuscle (especially the left ventricle). Other abnormali-ties can include blood leaking backward through theheart valves (regurgitation), or blood clots in the leftatrium of the heart.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFaculty Members of the Yale University School of Medicine.\nThe Patient’s Book of Medical Tests.

There is aslight chance of infection at the puncture site if the skinis not properly washed before the collection needle isinserted. Some donors feel light-headed upon standingfor the first time after donating. Occasionally, a donorwill faint. Donors are advised to drink lots of liquids toreplace the fluid lost with the donated blood. It is impor-tant to maintain the fluid volume of the blood so that theblood pressure will remain stable. Strenuous exercise\nshould be avoided for the rest of the day. Most patientshave very slight symptoms or no symptoms at all afterdonating blood.\nFor recipients, a number of precautions must be\ntaken. The blood given by transfusion must be matchedwith the recipient’s blood type. Incompatible blood typescan cause a serious adverse reaction (transfusion reac-tion). Blood is introduced slowly by gravity flow directlyKEY TERMS\nEndoscope —An instrument used to see and exam-\nine the inside of a body cavity or organ.\nGag reflex —A normal reflex consisting of eleva-\ntion of the palate, retraction of the tongue, andcontraction of the throat muscles.\nRegurgitation —Backward flow of blood through a\npartly closed valve.\nTransducer —A device that converts electrical sig-\nnals into ultrasound waves and ultrasound wavesback into electrical impulses.\nUltrasound —Sound waves at a frequency of\n20,000 kHz, often used for diagnostic imaging.into the veins (intravenous infusion) so that medical per-\nsonnel can observe the patient for signs of adverse reac-tions. People who have received many transfusions candevelop an immune response to some factors in foreignblood cells (see below). This immune reaction must bechecked before giving new blood. Infectious diseases canalso be transmitted through donated blood.\nDescription\nEither whole blood or blood components can be\nused for transfusion. Whole blood is used exactly as itwas received from the donor. Blood components areparts of whole blood, such as red blood cells (RBCs),plasma, platelets, clotting factors, immunoglobulins, andwhite blood cells. Whole blood is used only when neededor when components are not available. Most of the timewhole blood is not used because the patient’s medicalcondition can be treated with a blood component. Toomuch whole blood can raise a recipient’s blood pressure.High blood pressure can have medical side effects andshould be avoided. Use of blood components is a moreefficient way to use the blood supply, because blood thathas been processed (fractionated) into components canbe used to treat more than one person.\nWhole blood is generally used when a person has\nlost a lot of blood. Such blood loss can be caused byinjury or surgical procedures. Whole blood is given tohelp restore the blood volume, which is essential formaintaining blood pressure. Whole blood is also given toensure that the body’s tissues are receiving enough oxy-gen. Whole blood is occasionally given when a requiredblood component is unavailable in isolated form.\nRed blood cells are the blood component most fre-\nquently used for transfusion. RBCs are the only cells inthe body that transport oxygen. A transfusion of RBCsincreases the amount of oxygen that can be carried to thetissues of the body. RBCs that have been separated fromthe liquid plasma (packed RBCs) are given to peoplewho have anemia or who have lost a lot of blood.Platelets are another component frequently given bytransfusion. Platelets are a key factor in blood clotting.The clear fluid that carries blood cells (plasma) also con-tains blood-clotting factors. The platelets and plasmaclotting factors are extracted from donated blood andconcentrated for use. These factors are used to treat peo-ple with such clotting disorders, as hemophilia .\nImmunoglobulins, also called gamma globulin orimmune serum, are collected from plasma for use in tem-porarily boosting the immune capability of a patient.White blood cells (WBCs) are another infection-fightingcomponent of the blood. White blood cells are given bytransfusion only rarely.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3366TransfusionBlood donation\nEach year in the United States, about 14,000,000\npints of blood are donated. Blood collection is strictlyregulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The FDA has rules for the collection, processing, stor-age, and transportation of blood and blood products. Inaddition, the American Red Cross, the American Associ-ation of Blood Banks, and most states have specific rulesfor the collection and processing of blood. The main pur-pose of regulation is to ensure the quality of blood and toprevent the transmission of infectious diseases throughdonated blood. Before blood and blood products areused, they are extensively tested for such infectiousagents as hepatitis and AIDS .\nDONORS. Blood donors are questioned about their\ngeneral health, their lifestyle, and any medical conditionsthat might disqualify them as donors. These conditionsinclude hepatitis, AIDS, cancer , heart disease, asthma ,\nmalaria , bleeding disorders, and high blood pressure.\nScreening prevents blood donation by people who couldtransmit diseases or by people whose medical conditionwould place them at risk if they donated blood. Somegeographical areas or communities have a high rate ofhepatitis or AIDS. Blood collection in most of theseareas has been discontinued.\nThe blood pressure, temperature, and pulse of\ndonors are taken to ensure that they are physically able todonate blood. One pint (450 ml) of blood is usuallydonated, although it is possible to donate smaller vol-umes. The average man has 10-12 pints and the averagewoman 8-9 pints of blood. Within hours after donating,most people have replaced the fluid lost with the donatedblood, bringing their blood volume back to normal.Replacing donated blood cells and platelets can take sev-eral weeks. People with low blood pressure or anemiaand pregnant women should not donate blood or shouldlimit the amount of blood they donate. Generally, peopleare allowed to donate blood only once every two months.This delay ensures the health of the donor and discour-ages people from selling their blood. The practice of pay-ing donors for blood has essentially stopped. Donorswho sell blood tend to have a high risk for the transmis-sion of infectious agents.\nBLOOD COLLECTION. Blood is collected from the\ndonor by inserting a large needle into a vein in the arm.Usually, one of the larger veins near the inside of theelbow is used. A tourniquet is placed on the upper armto increase the pressure in the arm veins and make themswell and become more accessible. Once a suitable veinis identified, the area where the needle will be inserted issterilized by washing with soap solution or an iodine-containing antiseptic. Sometimes both are used. Thedonor lies on a bed or cot during the procedure, which\ntakes about ten minutes. Generally, an 18-gauge needleis used. This needle can easily fit into the veins and yetis large enough that the blood flows easily. Blood willsometimes clot in a smaller needle and stop flowing.Blood is collected in sterile plastic bags that hold onepint (450 ml). The bags contain an anticoagulant to pre-vent clotting and preservatives to keep the blood cellsalive. Properly handled and refrigerated, whole bloodcan last for 42 days.\nAUTOLOGOUS TRANSFUSION. Autologous trans-\nfusion is a procedure in which patients donate bloodfor their own use. Patients who are to undergo surgicalprocedures for which a blood transfusion might berequired may elect to donate a store of blood for thepurpose ahead of time. The blood is stored at the hospi-tal for the exclusive use of the patient. This procedureassures that the blood type is an exact match. It alsoassures that no infection will be transmitted throughthe blood transfusion. \nDIRECTED DONATION. Directed donors are family\nor friends of the patient who needs a transfusion. Somepeople think that family and friends provide a safersource of blood than the general blood supply. Studies donot show that directed donor blood is any safer. Bloodthat is not used for the identified patient becomes part ofthe general blood supply.\nAPHERESIS. Apheresis is a special procedure in\nwhich only the necessary components of a donor’s bloodare collected. The remaining components are returned tothe donor. A special blood-processing instrument is usedin apheresis. It separates the blood into components,saves the desired component, and pumps all the othercomponents back into the donor. Because donors giveonly part of their blood, they can donate more frequently.For example, people can give almost ten times as manyplatelets by apheresis as they could give by donatingwhole blood.\nBLOOD PROCESSING. A sample of the donator’s\nblood is collected at the time of donation and tested forinfectious diseases. Blood is not used until the resultsfrom these tests confirm that it is safe. \nBLOOD TYPING. The donated blood is typed.\nThere are major and minor blood types, also calledblood groups. The major types are classified by theABO system. This system groups blood by two sub-stances, called antigen A and antigen B, in the redblood cells. The four ABO blood types are A, B, AB,and O. Type A blood has the A antigen, type B has theB antigen, type AB has both, and type O has neither.These four types of blood are further sorted by the Rh\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3367Transfusionfactor. The Rh, or rhesus factor, is also an antigen in\nthe red blood cells. A person who has the Rh factor isRh positive; a person who does not have the factor isRh negative. If a person has red blood cells with boththe B and the Rh antigens, that person is said to have aB positive (B+) blood type. Blood types determinewhat blood a patient can receive. Generally, patientsare limited to receiving only blood of the exact sameABO and Rh type as their own. For example, a personwith B+ blood can only receive blood or blood cellsfrom another person with B+ blood. An exception isblood type O. O is called the universal donor, becausepeople of all blood types can accept it.\nBlood can be typed by several other minor antigens,\nsuch as Kell, Duffy, and Lewis. These minor antigens canbecome important when a patient has received manytransfusions. These patients tend to build up an immuneresponse to the minor blood groups that do not matchtheir own. Upon receiving a transfusion with a mis-matched minor blood group, they may have an adversereaction. A third group of antigens to which a patient canreact are residues from the donor’s plasma that haveattached to the RBCs. To eliminate this problem, theRBCs are rinsed to remove plasma residues. These rinsedcells are called washed RBCs.\nBlood components used in transfusion\nMost blood collected from donors is broken down\n(fractionated) into components that are used to treatspecific problems or diseases. Treating patients withblood components is the most efficient way to use theblood supply.\nRED BLOOD CELLS. Red blood cells (RBCs) carry\noxygen throughout the body. They obtain oxygen as theypass through the lungs and give up oxygen to the othertissues of the body as they are pumped through arteriesand veins. When patients do not have enough RBCs toproperly oxygenate their bodies, they can be given atransfusion with RBCs obtained from donors. RBCs arerecovered from whole blood after donation. They arethen typed, removed from the watery blood plasma tominimize the volume (packed), and stored. They aregiven to people who have anemia (including tha-\nlassemia ), whose bone marrow does not make enough\nRBCs, or who have other conditions that decrease thenumber of RBCs in the blood. Occasionally, red bloodcells from rare blood types are frozen. Once frozen,RBCs can survive for as long as ten years. Packed RBCsare given in the same manner as whole blood.\nPLASMA. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. It\ncontains many useful proteins, especially clotting fac-tors and immunoglobulins. After they are processed,plasma or plasma factors (fractions) are usually frozen.\nSome plasma fractions are freeze-dried. These frac-tions include clotting factors I through XIII. Some peo-ple have an inherited disorder in which the body pro-duces too little of the plasma clotting factors VIII(hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B). Transfusions ofthese clotting factors help people with hemophilia stopbleeding. Frozen plasma must be thawed before it isused and freeze-dried plasma must be mixed with liq-uid (reconstituted). In both cases, these blood fractionsare usually small in volume and can be injected bysyringe and needle.\nPLATELETS. Platelets are small bodies in the blood\nthat are essential for clotting. People who do not haveenough platelets have bleeding problems. People whohave lymphoma, leukemia, or thrombocytopenia , and\npeople who are receiving cancer therapy do not makeenough platelets. Platelets have a very short shelf life;they must be used within five days of blood donation.Platelets are packed into bags. A platelet transfusion isgiven in the same manner as whole blood.\nIMMUNOGLOBULINS. Immunoglobulins are the\ninfection-fighting fraction of blood plasma. They are alsoknown as gamma globulin, antibodies, and immuneserum. This blood fraction is given to people who havedifficulty fighting infections, especially people whoseimmune systems are depressed by diseases, such asAIDS. Immunoglobulins are also used to prevent tetanus\nafter cuts, to treat animal bites when rabies infection is\nsuspected, or to treat severe childhood diseases. General-ly, the volume used is small, and the immunoglobulinscan be injected. \nWHITE BLOOD CELLS. White blood cells (WBCs)\nare another infection-fighting component of the blood.On rare occasions, white blood cells are given by transfu-sion to treat life-threatening infections. Such transfusionsare given when the WBC count is very low or whenWBCs are not functioning normally. Most of the time,however, antibiotics are used in these cases.\nPreparation\nA person receiving a transfusion is treated in much\nthe same way as a blood donor. The site where the needlewill be inserted is carefully washed with a soap-basedsolution, followed by an iodine-containing antiseptic.The skin is then dried and the transfusion needle insertedinto the recipient’s vein. During the early stages of atransfusion, the recipient is monitored closely to detectany adverse reactions. If no signs of adverse reaction areevident, the patient is monitored occasionally for theduration of the transfusion period. Upon completion of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3368Transfusionthe transfusion, a compress bandage is place over the\nneedle-insertion site to prevent bleeding.\nAftercare\nRecipients of blood transfusion are monitored during\nand after the transfusion for signs of adverse reaction.\nRisks\nAdverse reaction to mismatched blood (transfusion\nreaction) and transmission of infectious disease are the twomajor risks of blood transfusion. Transfusion reactionoccurs when antibodies in the recipient’s blood react to for-eign blood cells introduced by the transfusion. The antibod-ies bind to the foreign cells and destroy them (hemolyticreaction). Transfusion reaction may also cause a hypersensi-tivity of the immune system that, in turn, may cause tissuedamage within the patient’s body. The patient may also havean allergic reaction to mismatched blood. The first symp-toms of transfusion reaction are a feeling of general discom-fort and anxiety . Breathing difficulties, flushing, a sense of\npressure in the chest, and back pain may develop. Evidence\nof a hemolytic reaction can be seen in the urine, which willbe colored from the waste of destroyed red blood cells.Severe hemolytic reactions are occasionally fatal. Reactionsto mismatches of minor factors are milder. These symptomsinclude itchiness, dizziness ,fever ,headache , rash, and\nswelling. Sometimes the patient will experience breathingdifficulties and muscle spasms. Most adverse reactions frommismatched blood are not life-threatening. The infectiousdiseases most often acquired from blood transfusion in theUnited States are hepatitis and AIDS.\nPatients who are given too much blood can develop\nhigh blood pressure, a concern for people who have heartdisease. Very rarely, an air embolism is created when air\nis introduced into a patient’s veins through the tubingused for intravenous infusion. The danger of embolism isgreatest when infusion is begun or ended. Care must betaken to ensure that all air is bled out of the tubing beforeinfusion begins, and that infusion is stopped before aircan enter the patients, blood system.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

The function of bile is to break down fats duringdigestion. When fatty foods move into the intestine, bileis released from the gall bladder, travels through the bileduct, and enters the first part of the small intestine (duo-denum). \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3369Transhepatic biliary catheterizationIf the bile duct is blocked, the skin becomes yellow-\nish (jaundiced), the abdomen is painful, and a fever\ndevelops. The bile duct can be blocked by gallstones ,\nsurgical injury, infection in the duct, or by tissue growthdue to cancer . Transhepatic biliary catheterization is per-\nformed to relieve bile duct blockage. The most commonreason for this procedure is to relieve obstruction fromthe overgrowth of cancer cells. Obstruction due to gall-stones is usually cleared by other means.\nPrecautions\nTranshepatic biliary catheterization is done when\ncancer has progressed to the point where all the malig-nant cells cannot be removed by surgery. Patients whoneed transhepatic biliary catheterization often sufferfrom additional complications of their cancer. Because ofthe likelihood of bleeding from the liver, this procedureshould not be done on patients who have blood clottingabnormalities.\nDescription\nTranshepatic biliary catheterization is performed by\ninserting a needle through the skin, into the abdomen,through the liver, and into the bile duct. A wire attachedto the needle then guides the catheter into place. The pro-cedure can take several hours. The patient is given med-ication for pain .\nThe catheter can either reestablish bile flow into the\nduodenum or reroute the bile so it drains into a bag out-side the body. The choice depends on the extent and posi-tion of the obstruction.\nPreparation\nThe standard preoperative blood tests are performed.\nThe patient should not eat or drink the day of the procedure.\nAftercare\nThe patient must stay in bed after the procedure for at\nleast six hours, to reduce the risk of bleeding. A nursechecks vital signs and looks for indications of complicationsuch as pain, cramping, or leakage around the catheter. Thecatheter is flushed periodically to keep it open. Patient andcaregiver education on how to keep the catheter clean andirrigated is an important part of aftercare. \nRisks\nThe most common complication of transhepatic bil-\niary catheterization is bleeding as a result of puncturing theliver. Infection may also r esult from this procedure. Some-\ntimes the catheter itself becomes blocked and is ineffective.Normal results\nTranshepatic biliary catheterization is a treatment,\nnot a cure. Successful treatment relieves the blocked bileduct, but does not change the underlying conditions thatcaused the blockage.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Insertion of a Catheter to Relieve Bile Duct Obstruction.” In\nEverything You Need to Know About Medical Treatments.Springhouse, PA: Springhouse Corp., 1996.\nORGANIZATIONS\nNational Cancer Institute.

    "title": "Transient ischemic attack",
    "content": "Transient ischemic attack\nDefinition\nA transient ischemic attack, or TIA, is often\ndescribed as a mini-stroke. Unlike a stroke , however,\nthe symptoms can disappear within a few minutes. TIAsand strokes are both caused by a disruption of the bloodflow to the brain. In TIAs and most strokes, this disrup-tion is caused by a blood clot blocking one of the bloodvessels leading to the brain. The blockage producessymptoms such as sudden weakness or numbness onone side of the body, sudden dimming or loss of vision,and difficulty speaking or understanding speech. If thesymptoms are caused by a TIA, they last less than 24hours and do not cause brain damage. Stroke-associatedsymptoms, on the other hand, do not go away and maycause brain damage or death . TIAs can serve as an\nearly warning sign of stroke and require immediatemedical attention.\nDescription\nStrokes are the third leading cause of death in the\nUnited States and the leading cause of disability.Approximately 500,000-600,000 people have strokeseach year, and more than 160,000 die as a result. About85% of these strokes are classified as ischemic. Inischemic stroke, a blood vessel leading to the brain\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3370Transient ischemic attackbecomes blocked and an area of the brain is deprived of\noxygenated blood. (The other 15% of strokes are causedby bleeding from a blood vessel that has ruptured.)Without the blood supply, the cells in that area of thebrain die. Since brain cells cannot grow back, the func-tions that are controlled by that brain area may be per-manently lost.\nApproximately 10% of strokes are preceded by one\nor more TIAs. The estimated annual number of TIAs isabout 50,000; an exact count is difficult because TIAs arenot always reported. They may be under-reportedbecause they typically last less than an hour, perhapsonly for a few minutes. Because they are so brief, TIAsmay not seem important. However, an estimated one-third of all TIAs are followed by a stroke within fiveyears. They are considered a medical emergency andprompt medical attention is very important.\nRisk factors for strokes and TIAs are very similar.\nThe risk of a TIA or stroke is higher among men, AfricanAmericans, people over age 65, and people with heartdisease or diabetes. Smokers, people with high bloodpressure, and people who are overweight also have agreater risk for TIAs and strokes.\nCauses and symptoms\nA TIA is caused by a temporary blockage of one of\nthe arteries that leads into the brain. Small blood clots,called microemboli, are the immediate cause of theblockage. The blockage forms because of damage ordisease within the circulatory system. Blood clots canform in blood vessels because of artery damage, heartdisease, and other cardiovascular problems. For exam-ple,atherosclerosis is strongly associated with TIAs.\nAtherosclerosis is the build-up of fatty deposits orplaque at certain areas in the circulatory system. Clot-ting cells in blood, called platelets, tend to stick to ath-erosclerotic plaques or other damaged sites withinblood vessels. Occasionally, a clot may grow largeenough to block a blood vessel, or a piece of a clot maybreak off and circulate to other areas of the body. If aclot does not dissolve quickly enough, it can lodge in ablood vessel and block it. In TIAs, the microemboli dis-solve within a short time.\nBlood flows into the brain through two main path-\nways: the carotid arteries and the vertebrobasilar arteries.The carotid arteries are located on the front of the neck;the vertebrobasilar arteries are at the base of the skull atthe back of the head. The symptoms produced by a TIAare determined by the arteries affected.\nIf a vertebrobasilar artery is blocked, common\nsymptoms include double vision and dizziness ,nauseaand vomiting , difficulty speaking, and problems under-\nstanding and using spoken words. There may also be anumbness around the mouth and a tingling sensation inthe limbs. Blockage of a carotid artery produces com-plete loss of vision, dimmed or foggy vision, and paraly-\nsisor weakness on one side of the body. These symptoms\nmay also be accompanied by language problems andspeech difficulty.\nWith either type of blockage, the microemboli dis-\nsolve within hours and full function returns.\nDiagnosis\nThe goal of diagnosis is to identify the precise cause\nof the TIA and to recommend treatment. Initial informa-tion that an individual can supply includes a medical his-tory, what drugs are currently being taken and why, and afull description of the symptoms. Blood tests are orderedto screen blood counts—that is, the numbers of specificblood cell types—and to measure sugar and lipid (fats,including cholesterol) levels. Based on this informationand a physical examination that includes blood pres-\nsure, pulse, and respiration measurements, one or moreof the following imaging tests are ordered.\nA computed tomography scan (CT scan) or a mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is usually the first\nimaging test. CT or MRI can rule out other problems,such as a tumor or subdural hematoma , which can\nmimic the symptoms of a TIA. A CT scan can alsouncover aneurysms and arteriovenous malformation,both of which are blood vessel abnormalities that cancause bleeding in the brain.\nAnother imaging test that is very useful is carotid\nultrasonography, a noninvasive procedure that allowsexamination of the interior of the carotid artery. Thisexamination can detect carotid stenosis, a condition inwhich the artery is abnormally narrow because of ather-osclerosis. Ultrasonography is very reliable in identify-ing stenosis, but it does not give enough information toaccurately assess the degree of stenosis. Because thetreatment used depends on the degree of stenosis, treat-ment decisions cannot be based on ultrasonography.Another type of ultrasonography, called transcranial\ndoppler ultrasonography , is used to detect stenosis of\nthe blood vessels within the brain and in the verte-brobasilar arteries.\nIf stenosis is identified, a further test called cere-\nbral arteriography may be done. This test is not done ifthe individual is in poor health, because it may be toorisky. Arteriography involves injecting a special dyeinto the blood vessels which makes them visible on xrays. This procedure is also used to find suspected\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3371Transient ischemic attackproblems with blood vessels in the brain. Because it is\nan invasive procedure, complications may arise. Typi-cally, these complications are minor and temporary. Ina very small percentage of people with cardiovasculardisease, the procedure may cause serious complica-tions, such as stroke.\nAlthough TIAs affect the brain, the ultimate cause of\nthe problem may be found in the heart. Heart disease ordamage to the heart’s blood vessels is assessed byechocardiography . Echocardiography is a type of ultra-\nsonography and is a noninvasive procedure.\nTreatment\nTreatment is aimed at preventing further TIAs and\nespecially at preventing a stroke. The particular therapydepends on the root cause of the TIA and is not begununtil this cause is identified. If at all possible, drug thera-py is the preferred method of treating TIAs. Surgicalintervention may be required if an individual’s situationis not likely to respond to medication or if medicationhas failed.\nAspirin is often chosen for drug therapy. It is some-\ntimes called a blood thinner because it blocks the func-KEY TERMS\nAngioplasty —A medical procedure in which a\ncatheter, or thin tube, is threaded through bloodvessels. The catheter is used to place a balloon orstent (a small metal rod) at an area of stenosis andexpand it mechanically.\nArteriography —A medical test in which an x-ray\nvisible dye is injected into blood vessels. This dyeallows the blood vessels to be imaged with x rays.\nAtherosclerosis —A build-up of fatty tissue called\nplaque inside arteries that can impede or blockblood flow.\nCarotid artery —One of the major blood vessels\nleading to the brain; it runs up the front of the neck.\nEchocardiography —A type of ultrasonography that\nis used to create an image of the heart and its func-tioning.\nEndarterectomy —A surgical procedure in which\ndiseased tissue and atherosclerotic plaque areremoved from the inside of an artery.\nIschemia —A condition in which blood flow is cut\noff or restricted from a particular area.

Since aspirin can cause gastrointestinal side effects,other drugs may be prescribed. These drugs includedipyridamole or ticlopidine hydrochloride (Ticlid).Dipyridamole, which works by relaxing the smooth mus-cles of the arteries, is not as effective as aspirin. Ticlopi-dine hydrochloride is an anti-platelet drug that is slightlymore effective than aspirin, especially in women. How-ever, it may cause diarrhea or lowered blood cell counts.\nBlood tests must, therefore, be done frequently whenpatients are taking ticlopidine.\nIf carotid arteriography reveals at least a 70%\nblockage of the carotid artery, surgical treatment is usu-ally recommended. The particular surgical method iscalled carotid endarterectomy . In endarterectomy, the\nartery is opened and the material clogging it isremoved. Another procedure, called angioplasty , has\nbeen suggested for treating carotid stenosis, but it is notwidely used. This procedure is performed by threadinga thin tube through the blood vessel to the site that isclogged. A balloon or a stent (a slender rod) is thenpassed through the tube to mechanically widen the nar-rowed area. This procedure is successfully used in otherblood vessels in the body, but there is some worry that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3372Transient ischemic attackusing it close to the brain may be too dangerous. Surgi-\ncal treatment of blockage of the vertebrobasilar arteriesis not usually recommended.\nTreatment of TIAs also focuses on underlying\nproblems. High blood pressure, heart disease, and highlevels of blood lipids all require medical intervention.Condition-specific medications are often prescribedand lifestyle changes are strongly encouraged. Thesechanges include giving up smoking or excess alcohol\nconsumption, engaging in physical exercise , and eating\nsensibly.\nPrognosis\nOne-third of TIAs are followed by stroke in next five\nyears; in the other two-thirds, the TIAs may either con-tinue or disappear on their own. However, because of therisk of stroke-related disability and death, all TIAsshould be treated as emergency medical situations.\nMedical treatment significantly decreases the risk of\nstroke for people who experience one or more TIAs.Anti-platelet therapy with aspirin or ticlopidine mayreduce risk as much as 31%. Carotid endarterectomy alsosubstantially reduces stroke risk. The procedure itselfcarries some risk, but the complication rate is less than5%. The risk of complication can be lowered by choos-ing to have the procedure done in a facility experiencedwith it and by a surgeon with a low complication rate.\nPrevention\nTreatment for TIAs is complemented by lifestyle\nchanges. These practices may also prevent TIAs andstrokes from ever occurring. Doctors and other health-care providers universally recommend that individualsstop smoking and consume alcohol in moderation. Reg-ular health checkups can detect high blood pressure,heart disease, and other underlying problems. Adheringto treatment for these problems can help minimize TIAand stroke risks. Finally, maintaining a healthy weightand engaging in regular exercise as able are stronglyrecommended.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCurrent Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1998. 37th ed.

Normally, the pulmonary artery carriesblood from the right ventricle to the lungs. The aorta car-ries blood from the left ventricle to the vessels of the restof the body.\nNormally, blood returning to the heart is depleted in\noxygen. It goes first to the right atrium of the heart andthen to the right ventricle where it is pumped to thelungs. While in the lungs, the blood picks up more oxy-gen. After the lungs, the blood flows to the left atrium,then the left ventricle, which pumps the blood outthrough the aorta to the rest of the body, thereby supply-ing the body with oxygenated blood.\nTransposition of the great arteries results in oxy-\ngen-depleted blood going to the body. The reason is thatthe connection of the two great arteries is reversed. Inthis case, the aorta is connected to the right ventricle.Blood returning to the heart goes to the right atrium andventricle, which is normal. Then, when the right ventri-cle pumps the blood out, it goes into the aorta for distri-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3373Transposition of the great arteriesbution throughout the body. At the same time, blood in\nthe lungs goes to the left atrium, the left ventricle, butthen back to the lungs. This happens because the pul-monary artery is connected to the left ventricle. Theresult is that highly-oxygenated blood keeps recyclingthrough the lungs, while oxygen-depleted blood recy-cles through the body without going through the lungsto reoxygenate.\nThis condition develops during the fetal stage and\nmust be treated promptly after birth if the newborn is tosurvive. The newborn can survive for a few days becausethe foramen ovale, a small hole in the septum that sepa-rates the two atria, is open, allowing some oxygenatedblood to escape and mix into the blood that is beingpumped throughout the body. However, the foramenovale normally closes within a few days after birth.\nCauses and symptoms\nTransposition of the great arteries is a birth defect\nthat occurs during fetal development. There is no identi-fiable disease or cause. The main symptom is a “blue”baby appearance, caused by a general lack of oxygen inthe body’s tissues. \nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made immediately after birth, when it is\nobserved that the newborn is lacking oxygen. This isnoted by the bluish color of the newborn, indicatingcyanosis , a lack of oxygen. A definite diagnosis is made\nby x ray, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiog-\nraphy . \nTreatment\nThe only treatment for this condition is prompt heart\nsurgery shortly after birth. In surgery, the two great arter-ies are reconnected to their proper destination. Thisrestores the normal blood flow pattern. The coronaryarteries are also reconnected, so that they can supplyblood to the heart itself. A catheter may be used to main-tain or enlarge the opening between the two atria untilsurgery can be performed.\nPrognosis\nLeft untreated, this disease is fatal within the first\nweeks of life. \nPrevention\nBecause there is no identifiable cause, there is no\nway to prevent this condition.Resources\nBOOKS\nAlexander, R.

It plays both a diagnostic and ther-apeutic role in the treatment of bladder cancers. \nPurpose\nTranurethral resection is the initial form of treatment\nfor bladder cancers. The procedure is performed toremove and examine bladder tissue and/or tumor. It mayalso serve to remove lesions and be the only treatmentnecessary for noninvasive tumors. \nDescription\nFor this procedure, a lighted tube (resectoscope) is\ninserted through the urethra, into the bladder. A clearsolution is infused to maintain visibility, and the tumoror tissue to be examined is cut away using an electriccurrent. Tumor and muscle fibers are biopsied (a sampleis cut out and examined, usually under a microscope) inorder to evaluate the depth of tissue involvement, whileavoiding perforation of the bladder wall. Every attemptis made to remove all visible tumor tissue, along with asmall border of healthy tissue. The resected tissue isexamined under the microscope for diagnostic purposes.An indwelling catheter may be inserted to ensure ade-quate drainage of the bladder postoperatively. At this\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3374Transurethral bladder resectiontime, interstitial radiation therapy may be initiated if\nnecessary. \nPreparation\nPreoperative x rays with dye studies are helpful as a\nguide in determining the character and extent of tumorinvolved. As with any surgical procedure, the patient isasked to sign a consent form after the procedure is thor-oughly explained.\nAftercare\nAs with any surgical procedure, blood pressure and\npulse will be monitored. Urine is expected to be blood-tinged in the early postoperative period. Continuousbladder irrigation (rinsing) may be used for approxi-mately 24 hours after surgery. Most operative sitesshould be completely healed in three months. Thepatient is followed closely for possible recurrence withvisual examination, using a special viewing device(cystoscope) at regular intervals as the physician deemsnecessary.\nAbnormal results\nComplications of the procedure may include\nbleeding, which may require bladder irrigation post-operatively, during which time the patient’s activity islimited to bedrest. Perforation of the bladder is anoth-er risk, in which case the urinary catheter is left inplace for four to five days postoperatively. The patientis started on antibiotic therapy preventively. If thebladder is lacerated, accompanied by spillage of urineinto the abdomen, an abdominal incision may berequired.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDollinger, Malin, et al.

Wright, RNTransverse myelitis\nDefinition\nTransverse myelitis (TM) is an uncommon neuro-\nlogical syndrome caused by inflammation (a protectiveresponse which includes swelling, pain , heat, and red-\nness) of the spinal cord, characterized by weakness, backpain, and bowel and bladder problems. It affects one tofive persons per million.\nDescription\nTM affects the entire thickness of the spinal cord,\nproducing both sensory and movement problems. It isbelieved to be linked to the immune system, whichmay be prompted to attack the body’s own spinal cord.Striking rapidly without warning, its effects can bedevastating.\nCauses and symptoms\nTransverse myelitis has many different causes,\noften triggered by a variety of viral and bacterial infec-tions (especially those associated with a rash such asmeasles or chickenpox ). Once the infection subsides,\nthe inflammation in the cord begins. About a third ofpatients experience a flu-like illness with fever about\nthe time they develop symptoms of TM. Sometimes,there appears to be a direct invasion of, and injury to, thespinal cord by an infectious agent (such as herpes zosteror the AIDS virus).\nTM can also accompany a variety of diseases that\nbreak down tissue that surrounds and insulates thenerves (demyelinating diseases), such as multiple scle-\nrosis (MS).\nSome toxic substances, such as carbon monoxide,\nlead, or arsenic, can cause a type of myelitis characterizedby inflammation followed by hemorrhage or bleeding thatdestroys the entire circumference of the spinal cord. Othertypes of myelitis can be caused by poliovirus; herpeszoster; rabies ,smallpox or poliovaccination ; or parasitic\nand fungal infections.\nMany experts believe that TM can occur without any\napparent cause, probably as the result of an autoimmuneprocess. This means that a person’s immune systemattacks the spinal cord, causing inflammation and tissuedamage.\nRegardless of the cause of the myelitis, onset of\nsymptoms is sudden and rapid. Problems with move-ment and sensation appear within one or two days afterinflammation begins. Symptoms include soft (flaccid)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3375Transverse myelitisparalysis of the legs, with pain in the lower legs or\nback, followed by loss of feeling and sphincter (mus-cles which close an opening, as in the anus) control.The earliest symptom may be a girdle-like sensationaround the trunk.\nThe extent of damage occuring will depend on how\nmuch of the spinal cord is affected, but TM rarelyinvolves the arms. Severe spinal cord damage also canlead to shock .\nDiagnosis\nA doctor will suspect transverse myelitis in any\npatient with a rapid onset of paralysis. Medical history,physical examination , brain and spinal cord scans,\nmyelogram, spinal tap, and blood tests are used to ruleout other neurological causes of symptoms, such as atumor. If none of these tests suggest a cause for thesymptoms, the patient is presumed to have transversemyelitis.\nTreatment\nThere is no effective treatment for transverse\nmyelitis, but any underlying infection must be treated.After this, the focus of care shifts from diagnosis andtreatment to learning how to live with the effects ofthe syndrome. Patients are helped to cope psychologi-cally with new limitations, and are given physicalrehabilitation .\nPhysical adaptations include learning to cope with\nbowel and bladder control, sexuality, inability to controlmuscles (spasticity), mobility, pain, and activities ofdaily living (such as dressing).\nAs nerve impulses from the spinal cord are often\nscrambled and misinterpreted by the brain as pain,painkillers are given to ease discomfort. Antidepressantsor anticonvulsants may also help.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on how much of the cord\nwas damaged. Some people recover completely, whileothers have lasting problems and need help in learninghow to cope with activities of daily living. People whodevelop spastic reflexes early in the course of the con-dition are more likely to recover than those who do not.If spinal cord tissue death (necrosis) occurs, the\nchance of a complete recovery is poor. Most recoveryoccurs within the first three months. A certain percent-age of patients with TM will go on to develop multiplesclerosis.

    "content": "Traumatic amputations\nDefinition\nTraumatic amputation is the accidental severing of\nsome or all of a body part. A complete amputation totallydetaches a limb or appendage from the rest of the body.In a partial amputation, some soft tissue remains attachedto the site.\nDescription\nTrauma is the second leading cause of amputation in\nthe United States. About 30,000 traumatic amputationsoccur in this country every year. Four of every five trau-matic amputation victims are male, and most of them arebetween the ages of 15–30.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3376Traumatic amputationsTraumatic amputation most often affects limbs and\nappendages like the arms, ears, feet, fingers, hands, legs,and nose.\nCauses and symptoms\nFarm and factory workers have greater-than-average\nrisks of suffering injuries that result in traumatic amputa-tion. Automobile and motorcycle accidents and the useof lawnmowers, saws, and power tools are also commoncauses of traumatic amputation.\nBlood loss may be massive or minimal, depending\non the nature of the injury and the site of the amputation.Patients who lose little blood and have less severeinjuries sometimes feel more pain than patients who\nbleed heavily and whose injuries are life-threatening.\nDiagnosis\nWhen the patient and the amputated part(s) reach the\nhospital, an Emergency Department physician will assessthe probability that the severed tissue can be successfullyreattached.\nThe Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS)\nassigns numerical values to such factors as body temper-ature, circulation, numbness, paralysis , tissue health,\nand the patient’s age and general health. This is one ofthe diagnostic tools used to determine how successfulreattachment surgery is apt to be. The total score is dou-bled if blood supply to the amputated part has beenabsent or diminished for more than six hours.\nA general, emergency, or orthopedic surgeon makes\nthe final determination about whether surgery should beperformed. The surgeon also considers the patient’swishes and lifestyle. Additional concerns are how and towhat extent the amputation will affect the patient’s quali-ty of life and ability to perform everyday activities.\nTreatment\nFirst aid or emergency care given immediately after\nthe amputation has a critical impact on both the physi-cians’ ability to salvage and reattach the severed part(s)and the patient’s ability to regain feeling and function.\nMuscle tissue dies quickly, but a well-preserved part\ncan be successfully reattached as much as 24 hours afterthe amputation occurs. Tissue that has not been pre-served will not survive for more than six hours.\nInitial response\nThe most important steps to take when a traumatic\namputation occurs are:• Contact the nearest emergency services provider, clear-\nly describe what has happened, and follow any instruc-tions given. \n• Make sure the victim can breathe; administer CPR if\nnecessary. \n• Control bleeding, using direct pressure but minimizing\nor avoiding contact with blood and other body fluids. \n• Patients should not be moved if back, head, leg, or neck\ninjuries are suspected or if motion causes pain. If noneare found by the EMT, lie the victim flat, with the feetraised 12 inches above the surface. \n• Cover the victim with a coat or blanket to prevent shock.\nThe injured site should be cleansed with a sterile\nsolution and wrapped in a clean towel or other thickmaterial that will protect the wound from further injury.Tissue that is still attached to the body should not beforced back into place. If it cannot be gently replaced, itshould be held in its normal position and supported untiladditional care is available.\nSaving the patient’s life is always more important\nthan recovering the amputated part(s). Transporting thepatient to a hospital or emergency center should never bedelayed until missing pieces are located.\nPreserving tissue\nNo amputated body part is too small to be salvaged.\nDebris or other contaminating material should beremoved, but the tissue should not be allowed to get wet.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3377Traumatic amputations\nThis man’s hand was surgically reattached following a trau-\nmatic amputation. (Photograph by Michael English, M.D., Cus-\ntom Medical Stock Photo.

Placing the sealed bag in a cooler or in acontainer that is inside a second container filled with coldwater or ice will help prevent tissue deterioration.\nPrognosis\nPossible complications of traumatic amputation in-\nclude:\n• excessive bleeding \n• infection • muscle shortening \n• pulmonary embolism\nImproved medical and surgical care and rehabilita-\ntion have improved the long-term outlook for these\npatients.\nPhantom pain\nAbout 80% of all amputees over the age of four\nexperience tingling, itching , numbness, or pain in the\nplace where the amputated part used to be. Phantom sen-sations may begin immediately after the amputation, orthey may develop months or years later. They often occurafter an injury to the site of the amputation.\nThese intermittent feelings may:\n• occur frequently or only once in a while \n• be mild or intense • last for a few minutes or several hours \n• help patients adjust more readily to an artificial limb\n(prosthesis)\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent traumatic amputation is to\nobserve common-sense precautions like using seat beltsand obeying speed limits and other traffic regulations. Itis important to take special precautions when usingpotentially dangerous equipment and make sure machin-ery is turned off and disconnected before attempting toservice or repair it. Appropriate protective clothingshould be worn at all times.KEY TERMS\nPhantom pain —Pain, tingling, itching, or numb-\nness in the place where the amputated part usedto be.Resources\nBOOKS\nSheehy, Susan Budassi.

The\ncause is almost always due to a bacterial or viral infection,acquired through ingesting contaminated food or water.\nDescription\nIt is estimated that anywhere from 20–50% of the\n12–20 million travelers going from temperate industrial-ized countries to the tropics will develop TD. Fortunate-ly, most of these episodes are of short duration; neverthe-less, about 40% of those affected will need to rearrangetheir schedule, and 20% will be ill enough to remain inbed for some days.\nThe chance of winding up with TD is directly related\nto the area one is traveling to; only about 8% of individu-als visiting an industrialized country are affected, whereasat least half of those traveling to non-industrialized regionsbecome ill. It is also clearly related to the number ofpotentially contaminated foods or beverages consumed.Attention to recommended guidelines regarding food safe-ty and sanitation can greatly decrease the risk of infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nBacterial infections are the most common cause of\nthe illness. Viruses and occasional parasites can also be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3378Traveler’s diarrheathe cause. As for the bacteria involved, toxin producing\ntypes of E. coli (called enterotoxigenic) account for\napproximately 40–60% of cases, with Campylobacter\nand Shigella each reported in at least 10% of cases. In\nsome studies, Campylobacter has accounted for almost\nhalf of the attacks, especially during cooler seasons ofthe year. The cause can vary depending on several fac-tors, including the season and country visited. More thanone organism can be found in 15–30% of cases, and noneis identified in up to 40% of cases worldwide.\nRotaviruses and a parvovirus called Norwalk agent\nare also responsible for TD. Giardia is probably the most\ncommon parasite identified, though amoebas ( Entamoe-\nba histolytica ),Cryptosporidium , and Cyclospora are\nbeing found with increasing frequency.\nYounger age groups, particularly students, are at great-\nest risk, probably because of where and what they eat. Indi-viduals over 55 years of age, persons staying with relatives,or business travelers are at lower risk. Foods with the high-est chance of transmitting disease are uncooked vegetables,unpeeled fruits, meat, and seafood. Tap water and even icecan be dangerous unless one is sure of the source.\nSymptoms usually start within a few days after arrival,\nbut can be delayed for as long as two weeks. Illness lasts anaverage of three to five days, but is sometimes longer.Cramping abdominal pain , lack of appetite, and diarrhea\nare the main complaints. In approximately 10% of patients,diarrhea turns bloody and fever develops in about half of\nthose. The presence of bloody bowel movements and feverusually indicates a more severe form of illness and makesShigella a more likely cause. Medications that decrease the\nmotility or contractions of the intestine, such as loperamide(Imodium) or diphenoxylate (Lomotil), should not be usedwhen fever or bleeding occur.\nComplications\nDiarrhea varies from a few loose stools per day to 10\nor more. Dehydration and changes in the normal blood\npH (acid-base balance) are the main dangers associatedwith TD. Signs of dehydration can be hard to notice, butincreasing thirst, dry mouth , weakness or lightheaded-\nness (particularly if worsening while standing), or adarkening/decrease in urination are suggestive. Severedehydration and changes in the body’s chemistry canlead to kidney failure and become life-threatening.\nAnother potential complication is “toxic mega-\ncolon,” in which the colon gradually stretches and itswall thins to the point where it can tear. The presence ofa hole in the intestine leads to peritonitis and is fatal\nunless quickly recognized and treated.\nOther complications related to TD can involve the\nnervous system, skin, blood, or kidneys.Diagnosis\nThe occurrence of diarrhea in an individual while\ntraveling is very suggestive of TD. Although there areother possible causes, these are less likely. In mostinstances, the specific organism responsible for thesymptoms does not need to be identified, and the majori-ty of patients need only rest and treatment to avoidpotential complications.\nWhen patients develop fever or bloody diarrhea, the\nillness is more serious and a specific diagnosis is needed.In those cases, or when symptoms last longer than expect-ed, stool samples are obtained to identify the organism.\nFor this purpose, laboratories can either try to grow (cul-\nture) the organism, or identify it with high-powered micro-scopes (electron microscopy) or with the use of special testsor stains. These can show parasites such as Giardia, Amoe-\nba, Cryptosporidium and others in freshly obtained stool\nspecimens. New techniques that involve identification ofDNA (the characteristic material that controls reproductionand is unique for all individuals) of the various organisms,can also be used in special circumstances.\nTreatment\nThe best treatment of TD is prevention; however,\nonce disease occurs, therapy is aimed at preventing orreducing dehydration, and using antibiotics when need-\ned. Fortunately, severe dehydration is unusual in patientswith TD, but any fluid losses should be treated early witheither fruit juices and “clear fluids” such as tea or broth,or with the recommended Oral Rehydration Solutions(ORS) suggested by the World Health Organization(WHO). Persons traveling to known areas of infectionshould consult with their physician prior to departure andobtain appropriate instructions. For example, it may beadvised to take along pre-prepared packets of ORSdesigned for easy mixing or commercial preparationssuch as Pedialyte, Ceralyte, Ricelyte, etc.\nWhen nothing else is available, the following WHO\nrecipe can be made up from household items and taken insmall frequent sips;\n• table salt: 3/4 teaspoon • baking powder: 1 teaspoon • orange juice: 1 cup • water: 1 quart or liter\nA debate has occurred in the medical community\nover the amount of salt (sodium) in the WHO prepara-tions; some physicians feel that the content is too muchfor use by well-nourished persons in developed coun-tries. Therefore these preparations should not be used forextended periods of time without consulting a physician.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3379Traveler’s diarrheaPepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate preparation) is\neffective in both preventing and treating TD. For treat-ment once symptoms begin, the drug must be takenmore frequently than when used for prevention. Bismuthsubsalicylate preparation (1 oz of liquid or two 262.5mg tablets every 30 minutes for eight doses) has beenshown to decrease the number of bowel movements andshorten the length of illness. However, there is someconcern about the large doses of bismuth in patientswith kidney disease; therefore patients should checkwith physicians before starting this or any other therapy.Patients should be aware that bismuth can turn bowelmovements black in color.\nMedications designed to decrease intestinal motility\nand contractions such as loperamide (Imodium), diphe-noxylate (Lomotil), or others are safest when used bythose without fever or bloody bowel movements. Thepresence of either of these symptoms indicates a moresevere form of colitis.\nAntibiotics are usually not needed, because most\ncases of TD rapidly improve with minimal treatment. Forpatients in whom symptoms are especially severe (4 ormore stools per day or the onset of bloody diarrhea orfever), antibiotics are indicated. Individuals with lesssevere attacks can be treated with either antimotilitymedications or bismuth subsalicylate.\nChoice of an antibiotic should ideally be tailored to\nthe most likely organism and then adjusted according toresults of stool cultures. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(Bactrim) or ciprofloxacin (Cipro) are the antibioticsmost often prescribed, but others are also used. The typeand duration of treatment continues to be revised, and itis therefore extremely important that patients check witha physician prior to beginning treatment. In manyinstances, an antibiotic can be combined with an anti-motility agent to provide the quickest relief.\nPrognosis\nUp to 1% of patients with TD will become sick\nenough to require hospitalization, and 3% will continueKEY TERMS\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) —A liquid\npreparation developed by the World Health Orga-nization that can decrease fluid loss in personswith diarrhea. Originally developed to be pre-pared with materials available in the home, com-mercial preparations have recently come into use.to experience diarrhea for at least one month. The major-\nity of patients rapidly recover with minimal therapy.Some will suffer symptoms for even longer. The smallnumber who continue to suffer symptoms will need care-ful evaluation to rule out the many causes of chronicdiarrhea (such as lactase deficiency, irritable bowel syn-\ndrome , parasites, etc.). It is unusual for diarrhea caused\nby bacteria to last over two weeks; therefore, more pro-longed diarrhea indicates a non-bacterial cause.\nPrevention\nThe best means of prevention is avoiding foods, bev-\nerages, and food handling practices that lead to infectionwith the organisms that cause TD.\nOne effective means to prevent TD is liquid Pepto-\nBismol; this bismuth-containing compound has beenshown to be very effective in reducing the incidence ofTD. Tablets are now available, which are easier to carry.Two tablets four times a day is recommended, but useshould not go beyond three weeks.\nAntibiotics can also prevent TD, but their use is con-\ntroversial, unless it is absolutely necessary to avoidinfection (such as someone on an important businesstrip). There is the tendency for bacteria in to becomeresistant to these medications if used excessively; andthese drugs do have side effects which can be worse thanthe effects of TD. The benefits and risks of antibiotictreatment should be carefully weighed.\nResources\nBOOKS\nButterton, Joan R., and Stephen Calderwood. “Acute Infectious\nDiarrheal Diseases and Bacterial Food Poisoning.” InHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Tremors",
    "content": "Tremors\nDefinition\nTremor is an unintentional (involuntary), rhythmical\nalternating movement that may affect the muscles of anypart of the body. Tremor is caused by the rapid alternat-ing contraction and relaxation of muscles and is a com-mon symptom of diseases of the nervous system (neuro-logic disease).\nDescription\nOccasional tremor is felt by almost everyone, usual-\nly as a result of fear or excitement. However, uncontrol-lable tremor or shaking is a common symptom of disor-ders that destroy nerve tissue, such as Parkinson’s dis-\nease or multiple sclerosis . Tremor may also occur after\nstroke or head injury . Other tremors appear without any\nunderlying illness.\nCauses and symptoms\nTremor may be a symptom of an underlying disease,\nand it may be caused by drugs. It may also exist as theonly symptom (essential tremor).\nUnderlying disease\nSome types of tremor are signs of an underlying\ncondition. About a million and a half Americans haveParkinson’s disease, a disease that destroys nerve cells.Severe shaking is the most apparent symptom of Parkin-son’s disease. This coarse tremor features four to fivemuscle movements per second. The shaking is evident atrest but declines or disappears during movement.\nOther disorders that cause tremor are multiple scle-\nrosis, Wilson’s disease, mercury poisoning , thyrotoxico-\nsis, and liver encephalopathy .\nA tremor that gets worse during body movement is\ncalled an “intention tremor.” This type of tremor is a signthat something is amiss in the cerebellum, a region of thebrain concerned chiefly with movement, balance andcoordination.\nEssential tremor\nMany people have what is called “essential tremor,”\nin which the tremor is the only symptom. This type ofshaking affects between three and four million Americans.The cause of essential tremor is not known, although it\nis an inherited problem in more than half of all cases. Thegenetic condition has an autosomal dominant inheritancepattern, which means that any child of an affected parentwill have a 50% chance of developing the condition.\nEssential tremor most often appears when the hands\nare being used, whereas a person with Parkinson’s dis-ease will most often have a tremor while walking orwhile the hands are resting. People with essential tremorwill usually have shaking head and hands, but the tremormay involve other parts of the body. The shaking oftenbegins in the dominant hand and may spread to the otherhand, interfering with eating and writing. Some peoplealso develop a quavering voice.\nEssential tremor affects men and women equally.\nThe shaking often appears at about age 45, although thedisorder may actually begin in adolescence or earlyadulthood. Essential tremor that begins very late in life issometimes called “senile tremor.”\nDrugs and tremor\nSeveral different classes of drugs can cause tremor\nas a side effect. These drugs include amphetamines, anti-depressant drugs, antipsychotic drugs, caffeine, and lithi-um. Tremor also may be a sign of withdrawal from alco-hol or street drugs.\nDiagnosis\nClose attention to where and how the tremor appears\ncan help provide a correct diagnosis of the cause of theshaking. The source of the tremor can be diagnosedwhen the underlying condition is found. Diagnostic tech-niques that make images of the brain, such as computedtomography scan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), may help form a diagnosis of multiple\nsclerosis or other tremor caused by disorders of the cen-tral nervous system. Blood tests can rule out such  meta-bolic causes as thyroid disease. A family history can helpdetermine whether the tremor is inherited.\nTreatment\nNeither tremor nor most of its underlying causes can\nbe cured. Most people with essential tremor respond todrug treatment, which may include propranolol, primidone,or a benzodiazepine. People with Parkinson’s disease mayrespond to levodopa or other antiparkinson drugs .\nResearch has shown that about 70% of patients treat-\ned with botulinum toxin A (Botox) have some improve-ment in tremor of the head, hand, and voice. Botulinum isderived from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum . This\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3381Tremorsbacterium causes botulism , a form of food poisoning . It\nis poisonous because it weakens muscles. A very weaksolution of the toxin is used in cases of tremor and paral-\nysisto force the muscles to relax. However, some patients\nexperience unpleasant side effects with this drug and can-not tolerate effective doses. For other patients, the drugbecomes less effective over time. About half of patientsdon’t get any relief of tremor from medications.KEY TERMS\nComputed tomography (CT) scan —An imaging\ntechnique in which cross-sectional x rays of thebody are compiled to create a three-dimensionalimage of the body’s internal structures.\nEssential tremor —An uncontrollable (involuntary)\nshaking of the hands, head, and face. Also calledfamilial tremor because it is sometimes inherited, itcan begin in the teens or in middle age. The exactcause is not known.\nFetal tissue transplantation —A method of treating\nParkinson’s and other neurological diseases by graft-ing brain cells from human fetuses onto the affectedarea of the human brain. Human adults cannotgrow new brain cells but developing fetuses can.Grafting fetal tissue stimulates the growth of newbrain cells in affected adult brains.\nIntention tremor —A rhythmic purposeless shaking\nof the muscles that begins with purposeful (volun-tary) movement. This tremor does not affect musclesthat are resting.\nLiver encephalopathy —A condition in which the\nbrain is affected by a buildup of toxic substancesthat would normally be removed by the liver. Thecondition occurs when the liver is too severelydamaged to cleanse the blood effectively.\nMultiple sclerosis —A degenerative nervous system\ndisorder in which the protective covering of thenerves in the brain are damaged, leading to tremorand paralysis.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) —An imaging\ntechnique that uses a large circular magnet andradio waves to generate signals from atoms in thebody. These signals are used to construct images ofinternal structures.\nPallidotomy —A surgical procedure that destroys a\nsmall part of a tiny structure within the braincalled the globus pallidus internus. This structureis part of the basal ganglia, a part of the braininvolved in the control of willed (voluntary) move-\nment of the muscles.\nParkinson’s disease —A slowly progressive disease\nthat destroys nerve cells. Parkinson’s is character-ized by shaking in resting muscles, a stooping pos-ture, slurred speech, muscular stiffness, and weak-ness.\nThalamotomy —A surgical procedure that destroys\npart of a large oval area of gray matter within thebrain that acts as a relay center for nerve impulses.The thalamus is an essential part of the nerve path-way that controls intentional movement. Bydestroying tissue at a particular spot on the thala-mus, the surgeon can interrupt the nerve signalsthat cause tremor.\nThalamus —A large oval area of gray matter within\nthe brain that relays nerve impulses from the basalganglia to the cerebellum, both parts of the brainthat control and regulate muscle movement.\nThyrotoxicosis —An excess of thyroid hormones in\nthe blood, causing a variety of symptoms thatinclude rapid heart beat, sweating, anxiety, andtremor.\nTremor control therapy —A method for controlling\ntremor by self-administered shocks to the part of thebrain that controls intentional movement (thala-mus). An electrode attached to an insulated leadwire is implanted in the brain; the battery powersource is implanted under the skin of the chest, andan extension wire is tunneled under the skin to con-nect the battery to the lead. The patient turns on thepower source to deliver the electrical impulse andinterrupt the tremor.\nWilson’s disease —An inborn defect of copper\nmetabolism in which free copper may be depositedin a variety of areas of the body. Deposits in thebrain can cause tremor and other symptoms ofParkinson’s disease.\nTremor control therapy\nTremor control therapy is a type of treatment using\nmild electrical pulses to stimulate the brain. These pulsesblock the brain signals that trigger tremor. In this tech-nique, the surgeon implants an electrode into a large ovalarea of gray matter within the brain that acts as a relaycenter for nerve impulses and is involved in generating\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3382Tremorsmovement (thalamus). The electrode is attached to an\ninsulated wire that runs through the brain and exits theskull where it is attached to an extension wire. The exten-sion is connected to a generator similar to a heart pace-maker. The generator is implanted under the skin in thechest, and the extension is tunneled under the skin fromthe skull to the generator. The patient can control his orher tremor by turning the generator on with a hand-heldmagnet to deliver an electronic pulse to the brain.\nSome patients experience complete relief with this\ntechnique, but for others it is of no benefit at all. About5% of patients experience complications from the surgi-cal procedure, including bleeding in the brain. The pro-cedure causes some discomfort because patients must beawake while the implant is placed. Batteries must bereplaced by surgical procedure every three to five years.\nOther surgical treatments\nA patient with extremely disabling tremor may find\nrelief with a surgical technique called thalamotomy, inwhich the surgeon destroys part of the thalamus. How-ever, the procedure is complicated by numbness, bal-ance problems, or speech problems in a significant num-ber of cases.\nPallidotomy is another type of surgical procedure\nsometimes used to decrease tremors from Parkinson’sdisease. In this technique, the surgeon destroys part of asmall structure within the brain called the globus pallidusinternus. The globus is part of the basal ganglia, anotherpart of the brain that helps control movement. This surgi-cal technique also carries the risk of disabling permanentside effects.\nFetal tissue transplantation (also called a nigral\nimplant) is a controversial experimental method to treatParkinson’s disease symptoms. This method implantsfetal brain tissue into the patient’s brain to replace mal-functioning nerves. Unresolved issues include how toharvest the fetal tissue and the moral implications behindusing such tissue; the danger of tissue rejection; and howmuch tissue may be required. Although initial studiesusing this technique looked promising, there has beendifficulty in consistently reproducing positive results.\nSmall amounts of alcohol may temporarily (some-\ntimes dramatically) ease the shaking.

    "content": "Trench fever\nDefinition\nTrench fever is a bacterial infection that causes\nrepeated cycles of high fever.\nDescription\nThe term trench fever refers to the crowded condi-\ntions in which troops fought in during World War I andWorld War II. Because the causative bacteria are passedamong humans through contact with body lice, over-crowding, and conditions which interfere with goodhygiene (including regular washing of clothing) soldierswere predispose to this disease. Currently, homeless peo-ple in the United States are sometimes diagnosed withthis illness. The bacteria are sometimes passed throughthe bite of an infected tick. This can cause the illness in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3383Trench feverpeople who participate in outdoor activity and encounter\nticks in that particular area.\nCauses and symptoms\nTwo different bacteria can cause trench fever: Bar-\ntonella quintana and Bartonella henselae.B. quintana is\ncarried by body lice; B. henselae is carried by ticks.\nInfection with B. quintana occurs when an infected\nlouse defecates while feeding on a human. When the per-son scratches, the feces (which are full of bacteria) arerubbed into the tiny wound. Infection with B. henselae\noccurs when an infected tick bites a human, passing thebacteria along through the tiny bite wound.\nSymptoms of trench fever begin about 2 weeks to a\nmonth after exposure to the bacteria. Sudden fever, loss ofenergy, dizziness ,headache , weight loss, skin rash,\nsevere muscle and bone pain can occur. Pain is particular-\nly severe in the shins, leading to the nickname “shin bonefever.” The fever can reach 105°F (40.5°C) and stays highfor five to six days at a time. The temperature then drops,and stays down for several days, usually recurring in five-to six-day cycles. An individual may experience as manyas eight cycles of fever with the illness.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is usually made on the basis of the patient’s\nsymptoms, and on knowledge of the conditions in whichthe patient lives. A blood sample can be drawn and bacteriain the sample are allowed to grow. Identification is made bylooking at the number of bacteria that may be present on aglass slide seen under the lens of a microscope. However,this technique can take up to four weeks, because this typeof bacterium grows very slowly. By this time, the practi-tioner has often decided to treat the patient anyway.\nTreatment\nErythromycin and azithromycin are both used to\ntreat trench fever. Four weeks of treatment are usuallynecessary. Inadequate treatment often results in a relapse.In fact, relapses have been reported to occur as long as 10years after the first episode.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis for patients with trench fever is excellent.\nRecovery may take a couple of months. Without treat-ment, there is always a risk of recurrence, even yearsafter the original illness.\nPrevention\nPrevention involves good hygiene and decent living\nconditions. When this is impossible, insecticide dustingpowders are available to apply to clothing. Avoidance of\nareas known to harbor ticks or the use of insect repellentsis necessary to avoid the type of infection passed by ticks.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCorey, Lawrence. “Rickettsia and Coxiella.” In Sherris Med-\nical Microbiology: An Introduction to Infectious Diseases.3rd ed.

    "title": "Trichinosis",
    "content": "Trichinosis\nDefinition\nTrichinosis is a disease caused by a roundworm\n(nematode) called Trichinella spiralis . An individual\nworm of this species is called a trichina, from the Greekword meaning “hairlike.” Trichinae can be readily avoid-ed by proper handling and cooking of certain meats, par-ticularly pork products.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3384TrichinosisDescription\nThe life cycle of T. spiralis includes several different\nstages. The adult trichina lives in the intestinal lining ofsuch meat-eating animals as swine, bears, walrus, androdents. After mating, the male worm dies while thefemale goes on to produce the offspring.\nRoundworms have a stage of development called the\nembryonic stage, which in many species occurs afterbirth. In trichinae, however, this embryonic stage occurswithin the uterus of the female, so that the offspring thatare ultimately discharged into the host’s intestinal liningare in the larval second stage of life. These larvae— bout1500 from each female worm—travel through the circu-latory system to the heart, then through the blood vesselsleading to striated muscle (the muscle of the skeletal sys-tem and the heart). Most larvae that cannot find suitablelocations in striated muscle will die.\nThose larvae that reach striated muscle will grow to\na length of about one millimeter, coil themselves, andenclose themselves within a protective wall called a cyst.This process is referred to as encysting. The worms in thecysts can live for up to ten years in this form.A pig that has been infected with T. spiralis , then, has\nthousands of cysts lying dormant within its muscles— thevery muscles that humans look forward to consuming inthe form of pork chops, ham, barbecued ribs, etc. Whenhumans sit down to a delicious meal of undercooked,trichina-infected pig dinner, they are ingesting T. spiralis\ncysts. The cyst walls are broken down by the usualprocess of food digestion in the stomach, allowing the lar-vae to escape into the new host’s intestines. There the lar-vae mature to become adult worms, capable of producinga new crop of larvae. When these new larvae hatch, theybegin their migration throughout the human host’s blood-stream to his or her muscles, where they live for a shortwhile before encysting.\nCauses and symptoms\nHuman hosts who eat meat infested with trichinae\nmay experience symptoms in varying degrees. If the meatingested has only a few cysts, then the human host’s loadof parasites (worm burden) is said to be relatively small,and symptoms will be moderate. In fact, many trichinosisinfections are subclinical, which means that the symp-toms are so mild that the infection remains undiagnosed.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3385Trichinosis\nA Trichinella spiralis cyst in striated muscle tissue. T. spiralis cysts can survive up to ten years in this form. (JLM Visuals.\nReproduced by permission.)In a host with a greater worm burden, the initial symp-\ntoms will be caused by the presence of the adult worms inthe intestine. These symptoms usually include fever ,\ndiarrhea , abdominal pain , and perhaps vomiting. The\nsymptoms begin about one to two days after eating thecontaminated meat, and may last for a week or so.\nWhen the larvae begin their migration through the\nblood vessels, the host will begin to experience symp-toms that affect the whole body (systemic symptoms),such as fever; swelling of the face and the area aroundthe eyes; rash; bleeding into the nail beds, retina, andwhites of the eyes; and cough . In very severe cases of\ntrichinosis, inflammation of the heart muscle ( myocardi-\ntis), lungs (pneumonitis), or brain ( encephalitis ) may\noccur. These symptoms can lead to the few deaths causedby trichinosis.\nThe larvae begin to burrow into the host’s muscles\nand form cysts within two to three weeks of the initialinfection. This encysting produces signs of muscleinflammation (myositis) including swelling of the affect-ed muscle groups, pain, and weakness. The most fre-quently affected muscles are the muscles outside the eye(extraocular muscles) that control eye movements; themuscles of the jaw, neck, and upper arm (biceps muscle);the muscles of the lower back (lumbar region); and thediaphragm, which is the muscle that separates theabdominal and chest cavities and aids in breathing.\nThe symptoms of trichinosis are at their most severe\nat about three weeks after infection, and decrease veryslowly in their severity. Recovery is extremely gradual,and symptoms may last for as long as three months.Fatigue and muscle pain (myalgia) may take several\nmore months to subside.\nDiagnosis\nAn initial diagnosis of trichinosis relies heavily on\nthe presence of its classic symptoms—swelling aroundthe eyes, muscle inflammation, fever, and high levels of acertain type of white blood cell (eosinophils)—coupledwith the patient’s history. If the patient reports havingeaten undercooked meat from an animal known to be apotential carrier of trichinosis, the doctor may order amuscle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. By the third orfourth week of infection, muscle biopsies usually indi-cate the presence of larvae. Stool tests rarely reveal adultworms, although larvae can sometimes be found in bloodor duodenal washings after the second week of infection.The blood test that is the most specific for trichinosis isthe bentonite flocculation (BF) test.\nT. spiralis can infect a number of different animal\nspecies used for food. The most common food culprit inthe United States has been pork sausage, while outbreaksin Europe have caused by wild boar and horse meat. Out-\nbreaks of trichinosis in Asia and Africa have been tracedto dog meat, and outbreaks in Northern Canada haveresulted from consumption of walrus and bear meat.\nTreatment\nSupportive care\nTreatment of trichinosis is primarily aimed at\ndecreasing the severity of the symptoms. Symptomaticrelief includes bed rest and medications to relieve feverand muscle pain. The medications most commonly givenare aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAIDs). Steroids such as prednisone (Deltasone,Meticorten) are reserved for the most severe cases ofmuscle inflammation, or for complicated cases thatinclude myocarditis.\nAnthelminthic medications\nIn addition to medications for pain relief, trichinosis\ncan be treated with drugs that are called anti-worm med-ications or anthelminthics. Two related anti-worm med-ications, mebendazole (Vermox) and thiabendazole(Mintezol), have been reported to be effective againstintestinal larvae, but not against larvae encysted in themuscles. In particular, thiabendazole has worked bestwhen given to patients who knew within 24 hours thatthey had eaten infested meat. Thiabendazole has, howev-er, anti-inflammatory properties that can relieve some ofthe pain during the muscle stage of trichinosis.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from trichinosis is gen-\nerally good. Most people with the disease are unawarethat they have even been infected. It is estimated thatbetween 150,000 and 300,00 people in the United Statesbecome infected yearly, so that at any given time, 1.5million people have T. spiralis infections. Most of these\npeople have such light cases that trichinosis is neveridentified. Worm burden is measured in larvae per gramof muscle tissue; people with 10 or fewer larvae pergram of muscle tissue usually have no significant symp-toms. When the number climbs to 100 larvae per gramof muscle tissue, the symptoms become noticeable. Peo-ple with over 1000 larvae per gram of muscle tissue areusually extremely ill, and often die. The mortality rate oftrichinosis is about 1%.\nPrevention\nPrevention of trichinosis is relatively simple. Swine\nshould be fed only grain or cooked garbage because\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3386Trichinosisuncooked garbage may contain contaminated pork\nscraps. Meat from animals prone to trichinosis infectionshould be cooked or smoked thoroughly until it is nolonger pink. Freezing meat at an adequately low temper-ature (5°F/–15°C for three weeks) can kill most encystedlarvae, except for species which infect such arctic mam-mals as walrus or bear.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPlorde, James J. “Trichinella.” In Sherris Medical Microbiolo-\ngy: An Introduction to Infectious Diseases. 3rd ed.

    "title": "Trichomoniasis",
    "content": "Trichomoniasis\nDefinition\nTrichomoniasis refers to an infection of the genital\nand urinary tract. \nDescription\nTrichomoniasis is caused by a protozoan (the small-\nest, single-celled members of the animal kingdom). Tri-\nchomonas vaginalis is passed almost 100% of the time\nthrough sexual contact. Trichomoniasis is primarily aninfection of women’s vaginal and urinary tracts. Awoman is most susceptible to infection just after havingcompleted her menstrual period. Men may carry theorganism unknowingly, since infection in men may causemild or no symptoms.\nCauses and symptoms\nBecause trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted dis-\nease, it occurs more often in individuals who have multi-ple sexual partners. The protozoan is passed to an indi-vidual by contact within the body fluids of an infectedsexual partner. It often occurs simultaneously with othersexually transmitted diseases , especially gonorrhea . \nIn women, the symptoms of trichomoniasis\ninclude an unpleasant vaginal odor, and a heavy,frothy, yellow discharge from the vagina. The genitalarea (vulva) is often very itchy, and there is frequentlypain with urination or with sexual intercourse. The\nlabia (lips) of the vagina, the vagina itself, and thecervix (the narrowed, lowest segment of the uteruswhich extends into the upper part of the vagina) will bebright red and irritated.\nIn men, there are usually no symptoms at all. Occa-\nsionally, a man will notice a small amount of yellowishdischarge from his penis, usually first thing in themorning. There may be some mild discomfort whileurinating.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3387TrichomoniasisDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is easily made by taking a sample of the\ndischarge from the women’s vagina, or from the openingof the man’s penis. The sample is put on a slide, andviewed under a microscope. The protozoa, which areable to move about, are easily viewed.\nTreatment\nThe usual treatment is a single large dose of metron-\nidazole, or split doses over the course of a week. Sexualpartners of an infected individual must all be treated, toprevent the infection being passed back and forth. \nAlternative treatment\nCure of trichomoniasis may be difficult to achieve\nwith alternative treatments. Some practitioners suggesteliminating sweets and carbohydrates from the diet andsupplementing with antioxidants, including vitamins A, C,\nand E, and zinc. Naturopaths may recommend treatmentwith two douches (a wash used inside the vagina), alternat-ing one in the morning and one at bedtime. One douchecontains the herbs calendula ( Calendula officinalis ), gold-\nenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), and echinacea (Echinacea\nspp.); the other douche contains plain yogurt. The herbaldouche helps to kill the protozoa, while the yogurt reestab-lishes healthy flora in the vagina. Acidifying the vagina bydouching with boric acid or vinegar may also be useful.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis is excellent with appropriate treatment of\nthe patient and all sexual partners. Without treatment, theinfection can smolder on for a very long time, and can bepassed to all sexual partners.Prevention\nAll sexually transmitted diseases can be prevented by\nusing adequate protection during sexual intercourse. Effec-tive forms of protection include male and female condoms.\nResources\nBOOKS\nNash, Theodore E., and Peter F.

This condition is also called tricuspid valve regurgi-tation and tricuspid incompetence.\nDescription\nThe tricuspid valve is located between the right atri-\num and the right ventricle of the heart. When the rightventricle contracts, it is supposed to pump blood forwardinto the lungs. If the tricuspid valve does not close tight-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3388Tricuspid valve insufficiency\nA close up image of Trichomonas vaginalis, the parasite\nthat causes vaginitis in humans. (Custom Medical Stock\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)ly, some of that blood leaks back into the right atrium.\nWhen the atrium receives its usual quantity of bloodfrom veins leading to the heart, plus the leaking blood,the pressure inside the atrium increases. This higher pres-sure creates resistance to the flow of blood in the veinsthat enter the atrium from the body. In addition, thisincrease in pressure causes the right atrium to enlargeover time. Congestion from fluid buildup occurs, particu-larly in the liver and legs.\nCauses and symptoms\nIf a person has serious lung disease or a narrowing\nof the pulmonary valve, the right ventricle must pumpharder to force the blood through the pulmonary valve. Inorder to pump harder, the right ventricle enlarges and thevalve opening stretches, causing the valve to leak.\nTricuspid valve insufficiency usually produces such\nvague symptoms as general weakness and fatigue . As the\nconditions worsens, a person experiences pain in the\nupper right part of the abdomen, caused by a congestedand enlarged liver. The legs may also swell ( edema ).\nAn enlarged right atrium can cause atrial fibrillation\n(the atria flutters, rather than pumping in a regularrhythm) and severe tricuspid regurgitation of blood,which can eventually lead to congestive heart failure .\nDiagnosis\nA leaky valve can be heard with a stethoscope; the\nsound is called a heart murmur. Additional support fordiagnosing tricuspid valve insufficiency comes from amedical history, physical exam, and chest x ray . Further\ntesting with echocardiography , to show an image of the\nleakage and its severity, is the most helpful diagnostictest for this condition. \nTreatment\nTricuspid valve insufficiency itself usually does not\nrequire treatment, since a tiny leakage occurs in mostnormal people. In certain cases, however, if there is\nunderlying pulmonary valve disease or lung disease,those conditions should be treated.\nIf irregular heart rhythms or heart failure are present,\nthey are usually treated independently of the valve insuf-ficiency.\nSince a person with known tricuspid valve insuffi-\nciency is at risk for infections of the heart, antibiotics\nshould be taken before and after oral or dental surgery, orurologic procedures. \nPrognosis\nTricuspid valve insufficiency is not usually consid-\nered to be serious. If it is the result of other cardiopul-monary disease, the extent of those conditions effect theprognosis.\nPrevention\nIn general, tricuspid valve insufficiency cannot be\nprevented.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMcGoon, Michael D., ed.

It is the largest ofthe four valves in the heart. When the tricuspid valve isnarrowed or stiffened, it decreases the amount of bloodthat can flow through it. This decrease raises the pressurein the right atrium and causes the atrium to enlarge. Italso causes the right ventricle to shrink, and lowers thecardiac output.\nCauses and symptoms\nTricuspid valve stenosis is most often the result of\nrheumatic fever . On rare occasions, it is caused by a\ntumor or disease of the connective tissue. The rarestcause is a birth defect.\nA person with tricuspid valve stenosis may experi-\nence generalized weakness and fatigue .

    "content": "Trigeminal neuralgia\nDefinition\nTrigeminal neuralgia is a disorder of the trigeminal\nnerve (the fifth cranial nerve) that causes episodes ofsharp, stabbing pain in the cheek, lips, gums, or chin on\none side of the face.\nDescription\nThe trigeminal nerve, which is divided into three\nbranches, is responsible for chewing, for producing sali-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3390Trigeminal neuralgiava and tears, and for sending facial sensations to the\nbrain. When this nerve breaks down for some reason, itcan trigger brief but agonizing sizzles of pain on one sideof the face.\nThis condition is unusual in those under age 50 and\nmore often occurs after 70. Women are three times morelikely to have the condition than are men. When trigemi-nal neuralgia does occur in younger people, it is oftenassociated with multiple sclerosis .\nThe pain, while brief, is so severe that the sufferer\noften can’t do anything else while the attack lasts. Peoplewith this pain often wince or twitch, which is wheretrigeminal neuralgia gets its French nickname tic\ndouloureux , meaning “painful twitch.”\nCauses and symptoms\nThe origin of trigeminal neuralgia is not certain, but\nscientists believe it may be caused by degeneration, pres-sure, or irritation of the trigeminal nerve. Some doctorsbelieve the pain may be triggered by pressure from a near-by abnormally-formed artery lying too close to the nerve.\nAny part of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve\nmay be affected. Neuralgia of the first branch leads to painaround the eyes and over the forehead; the second branchcauses pain in the upper lip, nose and cheek; the thirdbranch causes pain on the side of the tongue and lower lip.\nThe first episodes are usually fairly mild and brief,\nand it may be minutes, hours, or weeks before the nextattack. However, attacks tend to occur in clumps thatmay last for weeks at a time. As the sufferer ages, theepisodes become more frequent and painful, until theperson begins to live in constant fear of the next one.\nThe momentary bursts of pain usually begin from the\nsame spot on the face each time. The pain can be triggeredby touching the area, washing, shaving, eating, drinking,or even talking. Even a cool breeze across the face can setoff an attack. Pain is more severe at the ends of the affect-ed nerve, especially over the lip, chin, nostrils, or teeth.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is usually made by eliminating other\nproblems that could cause similar pain in teeth, jaw,head, or sinuses. Because patients with the conditiontend to avoid trigger points, avoiding chewing, shaving,touching or washing their faces can be a clue to diagnosisof trigeminal neuralgia.\nTreatment\nIt is not easy to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Pain can be\nsuppressed by a range of medicines, including the anti-epilepsy medicines carbamazepine (Tegretol) or phenytoin\n(Dilantin). These drugs slow down the nerve signals at cer-tain nerve terminals, which eases the pain. However, thesedrugs cause a wide range of side effects, including nausea,dizziness , drowsiness, liver problems, and skin allergies .\nSome people develop resistance to the drugs or they can’ttolerate the high dosage needed to control the discomfort.If the medicines are stopped, the pain usually returns.\nIf drug treatment fails, surgical treatment to block\npain signals from the nerve may be effective. Radio-fre-quency waves, gamma rays, or glycerol injections candeaden the nerve (and hence the pain).

    "content": "Trigger finger\nDefinition\nTrigger finger is the popular name of stenosing\ntenosynovitis, a painful condition in which a finger orthumb locks when it is bent (flexed) or straightened(extended).\nDescription\nTendons are tough, fibrous cords that connect mus-\ncles to bones. Tendons must slide easily through theirprotective coverings (tendon sheaths). The finger andthumb bones have tendons that are responsible for bend-ing and straightening the fingers. Problems start when atendon sheath narrows (stenosis) and the outer coveringKEY TERMS\nMultiple sclerosis —A progressive disease of the\ncentral nervous system in which the coverings ofnerves in the brain and spinal cord are destroyed. of the tendon becomes inflamed (tenosynovitis). The ten-\ndon swells because of the constriction, sometimes form-ing a nodule, and is no longer able to move smoothlythrough its sheath. As a result, a finger may lock in anupward position as the person tries to straighten it. Thecondition usually happens in the ring and middle fingersand is more common in women, typically over age 30. Ininfants and small children, the condition generally occursin the thumb.\nCauses and symptoms\nTrigger finger is often an overuse injury because of\nrepetitive or frequent movement of the fingers. Triggerfinger may happen because a person performs the samemanipulation over and over on a job, from squeezing andgripping during a weekend of heavy pruning and garden-ing, or from such hobbies as playing a musical instru-ment or crocheting. Trigger finger may also result fromtrauma or accident. The symptoms of trigger finger arepain in the fingers and “popping” sensations. Sometimes\nthe finger may lock down into the palm or lock outstraight. Symptoms are usually worse in the morning andimprove during the day.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of trigger finger and thumb is obvious\non physical examination . Often there is a click that can\nbe felt as the nodule passes through the sheath. Mostcases are uncomplicated although X rays are often takento rule out other injuries or disease such as arthritis.\nTreatment\nInitial treatment for mild or infrequent symptoms of\ntrigger finger include rest, avoiding or modifying thoseactivities that caused the inflammation, and the use of anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such asibuprofen. This may relieve the swelling and inflamma-tion that resulted in the constriction of the sheath and therestriction of the tendon. Injection of a steroid medica-tion (cortisone) into the tendon sheath is the next optionto treat trigger finger. Depending on the severity, theremay be one more injection a week later. Two-thirds ofpatients improve after one injection. Some physicianswill splint the finger in extension after the injection.\nIn severe cases that do not respond to injections and\nthe finger or thumb remains in a locked position, surgerymay be required to relieve the symptoms. A local anes-thetic is used for the surgical procedure performed on anoutpatient basis. An incision is made by a surgeon in thepalm of the hand at the base of the affected finger orthumb to relieve the constriction of the tendon. Recovery\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3392Trigger fingermay take up to four weeks. Sometimes physical therapy\nof the hand is required after surgery to regain good use.\nAlternative treatment\nTreatment should begin when a person starts having\ndifficulty moving the fingers. If started early, noninvasivemeasures have a good chance for success. Alternativetreatments include acupuncture to facilitate healing and\nmicrocirculation, pulsed ultrasound, and myofascialrelease work for the affected area.\nPrognosis\nAt least half of cases can be cured non-surgically.\nThe key to successful treatment is early intervention. Amistake people make is trying to work through the pain.Diabetics have a higher incidence of the condition andare sometimes left with a disability.\nPrevention\nTaking frequent breaks from a repetitive activity will\ndo much to prevent the condition. Depending on the inten-sity, that may mean a 10 minute break every hour from therepetitive activity. The break should be spent stretching thehands and arms and generally moving around.KEY TERMS\nMicrocirculation —The passage of blood in the\nsmallest blood vessels of the body, such as thecapillaries in the hand and fingers.\nMyofascial —The fibrous tissue that encloses and\nseparates layers of muscles.\nNodule —A swelling or knob that may form on a\ntendon and make it difficult to slide smoothlythrough its sheath.\nStenosis —Narrowing of a passageway or opening\nin the body.

    "content": "Triglycerides test\nDefinition\nTriglycerides test is a blood test to determine the\namount of triglycerides, a form of fat, in the blood.\nPurpose\nThe triglycerides test is one of the screening tests for\nexcess lipids (fats) in the blood. It is usually part of anevaluation of risk factors for heart disease.\nDescription\nTriglycerides are a form of fat that comes from\nfoods. They can also be made and stored in the body andare used as an energy source. High levels of triglyceridesin the blood can mean that there is too much fat in thediet. Hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of triglycerides) isassociated with coronary heart disease, especially sinceelevated triglycerides levels are often associated withunhealthy low levels of hyper-density lipoproteins (the“good” cholesterol), which are necessary for good health.\nPreparation\nFor triglycerides testing, blood is drawn from a vein\nin the arm. A vein at the inside of the elbow or on theback of the hand is usually selected. The area where theneedle will be inserted is cleaned with antiseptic. A smallneedle is inserted through the skin and into the vein,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3393Triglycerides testallowing a small amount of blood to flow into a collec-\ntion tube or syringe. Once the blood is collected, the nee-dle is removed from the puncture site.\nBefore the blood test, the patient may be required to\nrefrain from eating food for eight to 12 hours. Patientsshould not drink alcohol for 24 hours before the test.Some drugs may affect the test and the patient may beasked to cease taking certain medications before the test.Oral contraceptives , estrogen, and cholestyramine (a\ndrug used to treat high cholesterol ) can increase triglyc-\neride levels. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), asparaginase (anenzyme), and various drugs used to treat high bloodlipids, can decrease blood triglyceride levels. These sub-stances should not be taken prior to this test.\nAftercare\nAfter the blood sample has been taken and the nee-\ndle withdrawn from the puncture site, a cotton ball orgauze pad may be placed over the site and direct pressureapplied to reduce bleeding. A piece of surgical tape orgauze adhesive bandage strip may be secured over thesite to prevent further bleeding.\nRisks\nThere is a very small risk that the puncture site may\nbleed excessively, a bruise or infection may develop atthe site, or it may take several punctures to locate a vein.Some patients may feel faint or lightheaded when bloodis drawn.\nNormal results\nThe normal range of triglycerides in the blood\ndepends on the age and gender of the patient. Womennaturally have higher levels of triglycerides than men.Pregnancy can also increase triglyceride levels. As peo-\nple age and gain weight, triglyceride levels generallyincrease. For adults, a normal level is considered to beless than 200 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter). Levelsfrom 200–400 mg/dL are considered borderline high.\nAbnormal results\nTriglyceride levels ranging from 400–1000 mg/dL\nare considered high and levels greater than 1000 mg/dLare considered very high. High levels of triglyceridesmay indicate liver disease ( cirrhosis ), an underactive\nthyroid problem, uncontrolled diabetes, an infection ofthe pancreas ( pancreatitis ), kidney disease, or a diet too\nlow in protein and too high in carbohydrates. \nExtremely low triglycerides levels (less than 10\nmg/dL) can also indicate a problem. Low levels mayindicate malnutrition (not enough nutrients in the diet),\nmalabsorption (inadequate absorption of nutrients in theintestinal tract), a diet too low in fat, or an overactive thy-roid problem. \nResources\nBOOKS\n“Cholesterol and Its Health Hazards.” In The Consumer’s Med-\nical Desk Reference , ed.

When the immune system’sresponse to the virus causes nerve damage, the legs grad-ually lose strength and flexibility.\nCauses and symptoms\nTSP is caused by the HTLV-1 virus, which also\ncauses leukemia. The virus can be spread through theplacenta, and also through blood transfusions, breast-feeding, contaminated needles, and sexual contact.\nSymptoms may begin years after infection. In\nresponse to the infection, the body’s immune responsemay injure nerve tissue, causing symptoms that includebladder abnormalities, leg pain , loss of feeling in the\nfeet, tingling sensations, and unpleasant sensations whenthe skin is touched.\nAs many as 20% of patients with TSP may also\nexperience:\n• deafness\n• double vision• the tendency to incorrectly estimate the amount of\nmotion necessary to accomplish a specific task (dysme-tria)\n• exaggerated reflexes\n• facial paralysis\n• tremor\nDiagnosis\nInfectious disease specialists use blood tests and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord\nto diagnose this condition.\nTreatment\nWhile the disease is incurable, significant improve-\nment has been reported in the condition of TSP patientstreated with corticosteroids . These drugs are believed to\nalleviate symptoms by suppressing the immune system’sresponse to the virus that causes them.\nPlasmapheresis , a dialysis-like procedure in which\nsymptom-producing antibodies are removed from theblood, also provides temporary relief.\nPrognosis\nAs noted, TSP cannot be cured.KEY TERMS\nRetrovirus —A family of RNA viruses containing a\nreverse transcriptase enzyme which allows the virus-es’ genetic information to become part of the genet-ic information of the host cell upon replication.\nVirus —A microorganism, smaller than bacteria,\nwhich can only replicate within the a cell of a liv-ing plant or animal.

    "title": "Troponins test",
    "content": "Troponins test\nDefinition\nTroponins are specific proteins found in heart mus-\ncle. Troponin testing is done to diagnose heart attacks(myocardial infarctions).\nPurpose\nWhen heart muscle is damaged, as in a myocardial\ninfarction (MI), troponins leak out of cells and into the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3395Troponins testbloodstream. Increased troponin levels indicate myocar-\ndial infarction or injury in a person with chest pain or\npressure. Some MIs are silent, manifesting few if anysymptoms.\nIf infarction is ruled out in a person with continuing\nor recurring chest pain (unstable angina ), an increased\ntroponin level indicates the person has heart muscleischemia (a decreased supply of oxygenated blood to the\nbody), and is at an increased risk for a future seriousheart event.\nDescription\nAlthough troponins also exist in other muscles,\nthose in the heart are unique, and are measured separate-ly in laboratory tests. Troponins in the heart are calledcardiac troponins. There are two main types of cardiactroponins; T and I. T is also referred to as cTnT, while Iis also referred to as cTnI. \nBoth troponin T and I are cardiac markers used to\ndiagnose myocardial infarctions. Cardiac markers aresubstances whose blood levels increase after a myocar-dial infarction. Others include CK (creatine kinase),myoglobin, and CK-MB (one of three CK isoenzymes).\nLike all cardiac markers, troponins have a unique\ndiagnostic window (the timeline during which the markerrises, peaks, and returns to normal). Troponin levels risewithin four to six hours after the beginning of chest painor heart damage, and stay elevated for at least one week.This long elevation allows detection of a myocardialinfarction that occurred days earlier, but prevents detec-tion of a second infarction if it occurred only days afterthe first.\nTroponins I and T are considered superior cardiac\nmarkers for several reasons. The most significant is thatcardiac troponins are the only markers specific for heartmuscle. Other markers also increase following damage toother muscles. Troponin levels help predict the extent ofheart muscle damage; higher levels are associated withincreased damage, lower levels with less damage. Levelsin a healthy person are negligible, so an increase is easilydetected.\nThe main difference between troponins I and T is\nthat cardiac troponin I tests measure only cardiac tro-ponin; tests for cardiac troponin T may cross-react withtroponin found in other muscles and give positive orincreased results in the absence of heart damage.\nTwo types of tests for troponins T and I are available:\na traditional quantitative test that provides an actual mea-surement of troponin, and a newer qualitative test thatsimply reports the result as positive or negative.

    "title": "Tubal ligation",
    "content": "Tubal ligation\nDefinition\nTubal ligation is a permanent voluntary form of birth\ncontrol ( contraception ) in which a woman’s Fallopian\ntubes are surgically cut or blocked off to prevent preg-\nnancy .\nPurpose\nTubal ligation is performed in women who definitely\nwant to prevent future pregnancies. It is frequently chosenby women who do not want more children, but who arestill sexually active and potentially fertile, and want to befree of the limitations of other types of birth control.Women who should not become pregnant for health con-cerns or other reasons may also choose this birth controlmethod. Tubal ligation is one of the leading methods ofcontraception, having been chosen by over 10 millionwomen in the United States—about 15% of women ofreproductive age. The typical tubal ligation patient is overage 30, is married, and has had two to three children.\nPrecautions\nTubal ligation should be postponed if the woman is\nunsure about her decision. While it is sometimesreversible, the procedure should be considered perma-nent and irreversible. Up to 10% of sterilized womenregret having had the surgery, and about 1% seek treat-ment in attempts to restore fertility. \nDescription\nTubal ligation, or getting one’s “tubes tied,” refers to\nfemale sterilization, the surgery that ends a woman’s abil-ity to conceive. The operation is performed on thepatient’s Fallopian tubes. These tubes, which are about 10cm long and 0.5 cm in diameter, are found on the upperouter sides of the uterus, and open into the uterus throughsmall channels. It is within the Fallopian tube that fertil-ization, the joining of the egg and the sperm, takes place.During tubal ligation, the tubes are cut or blocked in orderto close off the sperm’s access to the egg.\nNormally, tubal ligation takes about 20–30 minutes,\nand is performed under general anesthesia, spinal anes-thesia, or local anesthesia with sedation . The surgery can\nbe performed on either hospitalized patients within 24hours after childbirth or on outpatients. The woman can\nusually leave the hospital the same day.\nThe most common surgical approaches to tubal liga-\ntion include laparoscopy and mini-laparotomy. In a\nlaparoscopic tubal ligation, a long, thin telescope-like sur-gical instrument called a laparoscope is inserted into thepelvis through a small cut about 1 cm long near the navel.Carbon dioxide gas is pumped in to help move the abdom-inal wall to give the surgeon easier access to the tubes.Often the surgical instruments are inserted through a sec-ond incision near the pubic hair line. An instrument maybe placed through the vagina to hold the uterus in place. \nIn a mini-laparotomy, a 3–4 cm incision is made just\nabove the pubic bone or under the navel. A larger inci-sion, or laparotomy, is rarely used today. Tubal ligationcan also be performed at the time of a cesarean section . \nTubal ligation costs about $2,000 when performed\nby a private physician, but is less expensive when per-formed at a family planning clinic. Most insurance planscover treatment costs.\nTubal ligation is performed in several ways:\n• Electrocoagulation. A heated needle connected to an\nelectrical device is used to cauterize or burn the tubes.Electrocoagulation is the most common method oftubal ligation.\n• Falope ring. In this technique, an applicator is inserted\nthrough an incision above the bladder and a plastic ringis placed around a loop of the tube.\n• Hulka clip. The surgeon places a plastic clip across a\ntube held in place by a steel spring. \n• Silicone rubber bands. A band placed over a tube forms\na mechanical block to sperm.\nPreparation\nPreparation for tubal ligation includes patient educa-\ntion and counseling. Before surgery, it is important thatthe woman understand the permanent nature of tubal lig-ation, and the risks of anesthesia and surgery. Her med-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3397Tubal ligationical history is reviewed, and a physical examination and\nlaboratory testing are performed. The patient is notallowed to eat or drink for several hours before surgery.\nAftercare\nAfter surgery, the patient is monitored for several\nhours before she is allowed to go home. She is instructedon care of the surgical wound, and what signs to watch for,such as fever , nausea, vomiting, faintness, or pain . These\nsigns could indicate that complications have occurred.\nRisks\nWhile major complications are uncommon after tubal\nligation, there are risks with any surgical procedure. Possi-ble side effects include infection and bleeding. Rarely,death may occur as a complication of general anesthesia if\na major blood vessel is cut. The death rate following tuballigation is about four per 100,000 sterilizations. \nAfter laparoscopy, the patient may experience pain in\nthe shoulder area from the carbon dioxide used duringsurgery, but the technique is associated with less pain thanmini-laparotomy, as well as a faster recovery period. Mini-\nlaparotomy results in a higher incidence of pain, bleeding,bladder injury, and infection compared with laparoscopy.Patients normally feel better after three or four days ofrest, and are able to resume sexual activity at that time.\nFollowing tubal ligation, there is a low risk (less\nthan 1%) of ectopic pregnancy . Ectopic pregnancy is a\ncondition in which the fertilized egg implants in a placeother than the uterus, usually in one of the Fallopiantubes. Ectopic pregnancies are more likely to happen inyounger women, and in women whose tubes were ligatedby electrocoagulation.\nNormal results\nAfter having her tubes ligated, a woman does not\nneed to use any form of birth control to avoid pregnancy.Tubal ligation is almost 100% effective for the preventionof conception. The possibility for treatment failure is verylow—fewer than one in 200 women (0.4%) will becomepregnant during the first year after sterilization. Failurecan happen if the cut ends of the tubes grow back togeth-er; if the tube was not completely cut or blocked off; if a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3398Tubal ligationFallopian tubes\nOvary\nUterus\nCervix\nVagina\nTubal ligation is a permanent form of contraception in which a woman’s Fallopian tubes are surgically cut, cauterized, tied, or\nblocked to prevent pregnancy.This procedure blocks the pathway sperm takes to fertilize an egg.

Among its causes are:\n• bleeding from the nose and throat \n• peptic ulcers \n• stomach cancer\n• esophageal cancer \n• a tear in the esophagus caused by violent vomiting\n(Mallory-Weiss syndrome ) \n• breaking of blood vessels in the esophagus\nThe most profuse bleeding comes from veins in the\nlower esophagus, just above the stomach, that have dilat-ed to enormous dimensions as the result of liver disease.When the liver shrinks due to cirrhosis (scarring from\nchronic disease), its blood vessels shrink, forcing bloodfrom the intestines to find alternate routes back to theheart. The blood usually flows through tiny veins in theesophagus located just beneath the passageway wherefood passes downward and vomitus passes upward.Major causes for this rearrangement are alcoholic liverdisease, chronic hepatitis, and cholangiitis. Calledesophageal varices, the affected veins can be easily dam-aged and bleed voraciously.\nDescription\nOne emergency method of stopping bleeding from\nesophageal varices is to tamponade it with a balloon. TheSengstaken-Blakemore tube is a complex rubber devicewith two balloons and three channels—one channel foreach balloon and one that goes all the way through. The\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3399Tube compression of the esophagus and stomachMinnesota tube has four channels, an extra one that\nopens above the first balloon. The bottom balloon isround; the upper balloon is long and narrow. The tube ispassed through the nose or mouth into the stomach,where the bottom balloon is inflated. Then the tube ispulled back until the bottom balloon comes up againstthe narrow valve at the top of the stomach, when it cango no further. At this point, the upper balloon is inflated,putting pressure on a length of esophagus where thebleeding veins are located. The tube is then fixed so itcannot be dislodged. The third channel in the tube is usedto aspirate (suck out) stomach contents to see if thebleeding has stopped. The fourth channel aspirates fromthe esophagus.\nThese tubes are a temporary measure. They stabilize\nthe patient until bleeding has stopped, blood transfusionsare received, and permanent repair is imminent.\nSince the lower balloon effectively separates the\nesophagus from the stomach, it is possible to determinemore accurately where the bleeding is located when it isin place.\nThis method of treating upper intestinal bleeding is\nbeing replaced by procedures that use a gastroscope, aflexible device that permits viewing and operating with-out surgery.\nPreparation\nThe procedure is explained to the patient and family.\nA sedative may be given to prepare the patient for theprocedure.\nAftercare\nWith the tube in place, the patient cannot eat and\nmay have some difficulty breathing.

    "content": "Tube feedings\nDefinition\nNutrients, either a special liquid formula or pureed\nfood, are delivered to a patient through a tube directlyinto the gastrointestinal tract, usually into the stomach orsmall intestine.\nPurpose\nTube feeding provides nutrition to patients who are\nunable or unwilling to eat food. Conditions where tubefeeding is considered include protein-energy malnutri-\ntion, liver or kidney failure, coma , or in patients who\ncannot chew or swallow (dysphagia) due to stroke ,\nbrain tumor , or head injury . Patients who are receiving\nradiation therapy or chemotherapy treatments for can-\ncermay also be candidates for tube feedings.\nPrecautions\nCertain medications may interact with some formu-\nlas to inactivate the nutrients or change the way that thedrug is absorbed.\nDescription\nA flexible, narrow tube is inserted into some portion\nof the digestive tract and liquid formulas or liquefiedfoods are placed into the tube to meet the patient’s nutri-tional needs. The feeding may be pumped into the tubeor allowed to drip into the tube continuously or at sched-uled feeding times. \nA feeding tube can be inserted by a surgical or non-\nsurgical procedure in several positions along the gas-trointestinal tract. The tube may be inserted into the nose\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3400Tube feedingsand passed down the throat and through the esophagus. A\nnasogastric tube is inserted through the nose with the endof the tube reaching into the stomach. A nasoduodenal ornasojejunal tube is inserted through the nose and ends ineither the duodenum or jejunum, both of which are por-tions of the small intestine. This type of tube placementis usually used for short-term feeding. Surgical place-ment of a feeding tube may be done if there will be along-term need for feeding that bypasses the upper diges-tive tract. An esophagostomy creates an opening in theesophagus, a gastrostomy creates an opening into the\nstomach, and a jejunostomy creates an opening into thejejunum. The feeding tube is then inserted through thesurgically created opening. \nTube feedings can be a mixture of regular foods that\nare blended with liquid to make a consistency that willpass through the tube. Nutritionally balanced liquidproducts are often more convenient to use and ensure abalance of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates along withvitamins and minerals . Specialized formulas are also\navailable to meet almost any nutritional need. For exam-ple, patients with severe burns , protein-energy malnu-trition , or slow wound healing may require formulas that\nare higher in protein. Patients with renal failure mayrequire low-protein formulas with lower concentrationsof minerals and vitamins.\nPreparation\nThe reasons that tube feeding is necessary are dis-\ncussed with the patient, as is the length of time that thefeeding tube is expected to be in place. The specific pro-cedure is also explained to the patient.\nAftercare\nPatients with ostomy feeding tubes may have the tube\npositioned level with the surrounding skin. A cap or buttoncan be placed over the opening so that it can be more com-fortably concealed under clothing. The opening and sur-rounding tissue need to be cleaned and inspected regularlyto prevent infection. For patients with a tube insertedthrough the nose, daily nasal hygiene is important and themouth and lips should be kept moist. Good mouth care isnecessary for any patient with a feeding tube.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3401Tube feedings\nEnteral\nfeeding container\nEnteral\nfeeding pump\nFlexible weighted tip8 Fr. feeding tube\nA feeding tube can be inserted by a surgical or nonsurgical procedure in several positions along the gastrointestinal tract to\nprovide nutrition to patients who are unable or unwilling to eat food.The feeding may be pumped into the tube or allowed todrip into the tube continuously, or at scheduled feeding times.The illustration above features a nasojejunal tube which isinserted through the nose and ends in either the duodenum or jejunum.

The placement of the tube should be\nchecked frequently and the head of the bed elevated dur-ing and after feeding to prevent the solution from movingback up the digestive tract. Feeding tubes can alsobecome clogged and should be flushed regularly withwater. If the feeding formula is too concentrated or giventoo fast, the patient may experience nausea, vomiting,cramping, and bloating. The feeding may need to bediluted with liquid or the rate at which it is givendecreased.

    "title": "Tuberculin skin test",
    "content": "Tuberculin skin test\nDefinition\nTuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease\ncaused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis .\nBesides culturing in the laboratory, the two most com-mon types of tests to screen for exposure to this diseaseare the Mantoux PPD tuberculin skin test, which is gen-erally considered the most reliable, and the older TB tinetest, which is now rarely used. These tests are designedto help identify individuals who may have been infectedby the tuberculosis bacteria. A diagnosis of active, infec-tious tuberculosis is never made solely based on theresults of a TB skin test, but requires further testing,including a sputum culture and a chest x-ray.\nPurpose\nBecause TB is spread through the air, especially in\npoorly ventilated areas, it is more commonly foundamong people living in crowded conditions, such as jails,nursing homes, and homeless shelters. Often, a TB skintest will be given as part of a physical examination\nwhen a person is hiring a new employee, particularly forthose individuals seeking employment in the health-careor food service professions.\nPeople can be exposed to or infected with TB with-\nout showing any symptoms or necessarily developing thedisease. Individuals with normally functioning immunesystems generally prevent the spread of the bacteria by“walling off” or encysting the bacteria within the body. Tobe at risk for infection a person must have or had closecontact with someone who has active tuberculosis (suchas a friend or family member). Persons who are more atrisk for developing the TB infection overtly include thosewith a weakened immune system (immuno compromised),\neither from a chronic disease, such as HIV infection; or asa result of a tissue or or gan transplant or other medical\ntreatment designed to suppress the immune system.Symptoms of tuberculosis include a persistent cough ,\nfever , weight loss, night sweats, fatigue , and loss of\nappetite.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3402Tuberculin skin testPrecautions\nAlthough the test is generally considered safe, it is\nimportant to inform the person conducting the test if thepatient may be pregnant, have had a positive TB test inthe past, or have had tuberculosis in the past. People whohave had a positive TB test in the past will probablyalways have a positive test and should not be tested again.\nThere are several situations when the TB test results\nmight not be accurate. These include situations involvingpeople who:\n• have had vaccinations (such as those for measles ,polio ,\nrubella or mumps ) within the last four weeks\n• are taking steroids\n• have severe malnutrition\nDescription\nTB skin tests are usually given at a clinic, hospital,\nor doctor’s office. Sometimes the tests are given atschools or workplaces and may be a pre-employmentrequirement. Many cities provide free TB skin tests andfollowup care. The Mantoux PPD tuberculin skin testinvolves injecting a very small amount of a substancecalled PPD tuberculin just under the top layer of the skin(intracutaneously). Tuberculin is a mixture of antigensobtained from the culture of M. tuberculosis . Antigens\nare foreign particles or proteins that stimulate theimmune system to produce antibodies. Two differenttuberculin preparations are available, Old Tuberculin(OT) and Purified Protein Derivative (PPD). The latter isthe preferred testing substance. The test is usually givenon the inside of the forearm about halfway between thewrist and the elbow, where a small bubble will form asthe tuberculin is injected. The skin test takes just aminute to administer.\nAfter 48–72 hours, the test site will be examined by\na trained person for evidence of swelling. People whohave been exposed to tuberculosis will develop animmune response, causing a slight swelling at the injec-tion site. If there is a lump or swelling, the health careprovider will use a ruler to measure the size of the reac-tion.\nThe other method of TB skin test is called the multi-\nple puncture test or tine test because the small test instru-ment has several small tines that lightly prick the skin.The small points of the instrument are either coated withdried tuberculin or are used to puncture through a film ofliquid tuberculin. The test is read by measuring the sizeof the largest papule. Because it is not possible to pre-cisely control the amount of tuberculin used in the tinetest, a positive test should be verified using the Mantouxtest. For this reason, the tine test is not as widely used as\nthe Mantoux test and is considered to be less reliable.\nPreparation\nThere is no special preparation needed before a TB\nskin test. A brief personal history will be taken to deter-mine whether the person has had tuberculosis or a TBtest before, has been in close contact with anyone withTB, or has any significant risk factors. Directly beforethe test, the skin on the arm at the injection site is usuallycleaned with an alcohol swab and allowed to air dry.\nAftercare\nAfter having a TB skin test, it is extremely important\nto make sure that the patient keeps the appointment tohave the test reaction read. The patient is instructed tokeep the test site clean, uncovered, and to not scratch orrub the area. Should severe swelling, itching , or pain\noccur, or if the patient has trouble breathing, the clinic orhealth care provider should be contacted immediately.\nRisks\nThe risk of an adverse reaction is very low. Occa-\nsionally, an individual who has been exposed to the TBbacteria will develop a large reaction in which the armswells and is uncomfortable. This reaction should disap-pear in two weeks. A sore might develop where the injec-tion was given, or a fever could occur, but these areextremely rare reactions.\nIt is possible that a person who has TB may receive a\nnegative test result (called a “false negative”) or a personwho does not have TB may receive a positive test result(called a “false positive”). If there is some doubt, the testmay be repeated or the person may be given a diagnostictest using a chest x ray and/or sputum sample culture\ntest to determine whether the disease is present and/oractive in the lungs.\nNormal results\nIn people who have not been exposed to TB, there\nwill be little or no swelling at the test site after 48–72hours. This is a negative test. Negative tests can be inter-preted to mean that the person has not been infected withthe tuberculosis bacteria or that the person has beeninfected recently and not enough time has elapsed for thebody to react to the skin test. Persons become sensitivebetween two and ten weeks after the initial infection. Asa result, if the person has been in contact with someonewith tuberculosis, the test should be repeated in threemonths. Also, because it may take longer than 72 hours\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3403Tuberculin skin testfor an elderly individual to develop a reaction, it may be\nuseful to repeat the TB skin test after one week to ade-quately screen these individuals. Immunocompromisedpersons may be unable to react sufficiently to the Man-toux test, and either a chest x ray or sputum sample maybe required.\nAbnormal results\nA reaction of 5 mm of induration (swelling) is con-\nsidered positive for the following groups:\n• household contacts of persons with active tuberculosis\n• AIDS patients\n• persons with old healed tuberculosis on chest x ray• organ transplant recipients\n• persons receiving immunosuppressive medications\nA reaction of 10 mm of induration is considered\npositive in individuals with one or more of the followingrisk factors which are either reasons to have a higherexposure to TB and/or a condition that increases the riskfor progression to active TB:\n• foreign-born immigrants from Asia, Africa, or Latin\nAmerica\n• injection drug users\n• residents and employees of such high-risk congregate\nsettings as hospitals and jails\n• medically underserved low-income populations\n• TB lab personnel\n• children younger than four years of age or infants, chil-\ndren or adolescents exposed to adults in high risk cate-gories\n• residents of long-term care facilities\n• individuals with certain medical conditions that\nincrease the risk of developing tuberculosis; these med-ical conditions include being 10% or more below idealbody weight, silicosis , chronic renal failure, diabetes\nmellitus , high dose corticosteroid or other immunosup-\npressive therapy, some blood disorders like leukemiaand lymphomas, and other cancer\nFinally, a reaction of 15 mm of induration or greater\nis considered positive in those with no risk factors andare therefore at the lowest risk of developing TB.\nA TB skin conversion is defined as an increase of 10\nmm or greater of induration within a two year period,regardless of age.\nA positive reaction to tuberculin may be the result of\na previous natural infection with M. tuberculosis , infec-\ntion with a variety of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria(cross-reaction), or tuberculosis vaccination with a live,\nbut weakened (attenuated) mycobacterial strain. TB vaci-nation is not done in the US. Cross-reactions are positivereactions that occur as a result of a person’s exposure toother non-tuberculosis bacteria. These tend to be smallerthan those caused by M. tuberculosis . There is no reliable\nway of distinguishing whether a positive TB skin test isdue to a previous vaccination against tuberculosis. Gen-erally, however, positive results are not due to vaccina-tion exposure because reactions in vaccinated peopletend to be less than 10 mm, and an individual’s sensitivi-ty to tuberculin steadily declines after vaccination. If theskin test is interpreted as positive, a chest x ray will beperformed to determine whether the person has activetuberculosis or whether the body has sufficiently handledthe infection.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFaculty Members at the Yale University School of Medicine.\n“Tuberculin Skin Testing.” In The Patient’s Guide to Med-\nical Tests, edited by Barry L.

    "content": "Tuberculosis\nDefinition\nTuberculosis (TB) is a potentially fatal contagious\ndisease that can affect almost any part of the body but ismainly an infection of the lungs. It is caused by a bacteri-al microorganism, the tubercle bacillus or Mycobacteri-\num tuberculosis . Although TB can be treated, cured, and\ncan be prevented if persons at risk take certain drugs, sci-entists have never come close to wiping it out. Few dis-eases have caused so much distressing illness for cen-turies and claimed so many lives.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\nimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.\nAntigen —Any foreign particle or protein that\ncauses an immune response.\nAttenuated —A live but weakened microorganism\nthat can no longer produce disease.\nCross-reaction —Positive reactions that occur as a\nresult of a person’s exposure to other non-tubercu-losis bacteria.\nImmunocompromised —A state in which the\nimmune system is suppressed or not functioningproperly.\nIntracutaneous —Into the skin, in this case directly\nunder the top layer of skin.\nMantoux or PPD test —Other names for a tuber-\nculin skin test. PPD stands for purified proteinderivative.\nTuberculin —A mixture of antigens obtained from\nthe cultured bacteria that cause tuberculosis,Mycobacterium tuberculosis .Description\nOverview\nTuberculosis was popularly known as consumption\nfor a long time. Scientists know it as an infection causedby M. tuberculosis . In 1882, the microbiologist Robert\nKoch discovered the tubercle bacillus, at a time when oneof every seven deaths in Europe was caused by TB.Because antibiotics were unknown, the only means of\ncontrolling the spread of infection was to isolate patientsin private sanitoria or hospitals limited to patients withTB—a practice that continues to this day in many coun-tries. The net effect of this pattern of treatment was toseparate the study of tuberculosis from mainstream medi-cine. Entire organizations were set up to study not onlythe disease as it affected individual patients, but its impacton the society as a whole. At the turn of the twentieth cen-tury more than 80% of the population in the United Stateswere infected before age 20, and tuberculosis was the sin-gle most common cause of death . By 1938 there were\nmore than 700 TB hospitals in this country.\nTuberculosis spread much more widely in Europe\nwhen the industrial revolution began in the late nine-teenth century. The disease became widespread some-what later in the United States, because the movement ofthe population to large cities made overcrowded housingso common. When streptomycin, the first antibioticeffective against M. tuberculosis , was discovered in the\nearly 1940s, the infection began to come under control.Although other more effective anti-tuberculosis drugswere developed in the following decades, the number ofcases of TB in the United States began to rise again in themid-1980s. This upsurge was in part again a result ofovercrowding and unsanitary conditions in the poor areasof large cities, prisons, and homeless shelters. Infectedvisitors and immigrants to the United States also con-tributed to the resurgence of TB. An additional factor isthe AIDS epidemic. AIDS patients are much more likely\nto develop tuberculosis because of their weakenedimmune systems. There still are an estimated 8 to 10 mil-lion new cases of TB each year worldwide, causingroughly 3 million deaths.\nHigh-risk populations\nTHE ELDERLY. Tuberculosis is more common in\nelderly persons. More than one-fourth of the nearly23,000 cases of TB reported in the United States in 1995developed in people above age 65. Many elderly patientsdeveloped the infection some years ago when the diseasewas more widespread. There are additional reasons forthe vulnerability of older people: those living in nursinghomes and similar facilities are in close contact with oth-ers who may be infected. The aging process itself may\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3405Tuberculosisweaken the body’s immune system, which is then less\nable to ward off the tubercle bacillus. Finally, bacteriathat have lain dormant for some time in elderly personsmay be reactivated and cause illness.\nRACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. TB also is more\ncommon in blacks, who are more likely to live underconditions that promote infection. As the end of the cen-tury approaches, two-thirds of all cases of TB in theUnited States affect African Americans, Hispanics,Asians, and persons from the Pacific Islands. Anotherone-fourth of cases affect persons born outside the Unit-ed States. As of 1992, the risk of TB was still increasingin all these groups.\nLIFESTYLE FACTORS. The high risk of TB in AIDS\npatients extends to those infected by human immunode-\nficiency virus (HIV) who have not yet developed clinical\nsigns of AIDS. Alcoholics and intravenous drug abusersare also at increased risk of contracting tuberculosis.Until the economic and social factors that influence thespread of tubercular infection are remedied, there is noreal possibility of completely eliminating the disease. \nCauses and symptoms\nTransmission\nTuberculosis spreads by droplet infection. This type\nof transmission means that when a TB patient exhales,coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets of fluid containingtubercle bacilli are released into the air. This mist, oraerosol as it is often called, can be taken into the nasalpassages and lungs of a susceptible person nearby.Tuberculosis is not, however, highly contagious com-pared to some other infectious diseases. Only about onein three close contacts of a TB patient, and fewer than15% of more remote contacts, are likely to becomeinfected. As a rule, close, frequent, or prolonged contactis needed to spread the disease. Of course, if a severelyinfected patient emits huge numbers of bacilli, thechance of transmitting infection is much greater. Unlikemany other infections, TB is not passed on by contactwith a patient’s clothing, bed linens, or dishes and cook-ing utensils. The most important exception is pregnancy .\nThe fetus of an infected mother may contract TB byinhaling or swallowing the bacilli in the amniotic fluid.\nProgression\nOnce inhaled, tubercle bacilli may reach the small\nbreathing sacs in the lungs (the alveoli), where they aretaken up by cells called macrophages. The bacilli multi-ply within these cells and then spread through the lymphvessels to nearby lymph nodes. Sometimes the bacillimove through blood vessels to distant organs. At thispoint they may either remain alive but inactive (quies-\ncent), or they may cause active disease. Actual tissuedamage is not caused directly by the tubercle bacillus, butby the reaction of the person’s tissues to its presence. In amatter of weeks the host develops an immune response tothe bacillus. Cells attack the bacilli, permit the initialdamage to heal, and prevent future disease permanently.\nInfection does not always mean disease; in fact, it\nusually does not. At least nine of ten patients who harborM. tuberculosis do not develop symptoms or physical\nevidence of active disease, and their x-rays remain nega-tive. They are not contagious; however, they do form apool of infected patients who may get sick at a later dateand then pass on TB to others. It is thought that morethan 90% of cases of active tuberculosis come from thispool. In the United States this group numbers 10 to 15million persons. Whether or not a particular infected per-son will become ill is impossible to predict with certain-ty. An estimated 5% of infected persons get sick within12–24 months of being infected. Another 5% heal initial-ly but, after years or decades, develop active tuberculosiseither in the lungs or elsewhere in the body. This form ofthe disease is called reactivation TB, or post-primary dis-ease. On rare occasions a previously infected person getssick again after a later exposure to the tubercle bacillus.\nPulmonary tuberculosis\nPulmonary tuberculosis is TB that affects the lungs.\nIts initial symptoms are easily confused with those ofother diseases. An infected person may at first feelvaguely unwell or develop a cough blamed on smoking\nor a cold. A small amount of greenish or yellow sputummay be coughed up when the person gets up in the morn-ing. In time, more sputum is produced that is streakedwith blood. Persons with pulmonary TB do not run ahigh fever , but they often have a low-grade one. They\nmay wake up in the night drenched with cold sweat whenthe fever breaks. The patient often loses interest in foodand may lose weight. Chest pain is sometimes present. If\nthe infection allows air to escape from the lungs into thechest cavity ( pneumothorax ) or if fluid collects in the\npleural space ( pleural effusion ), the patient may have\ndifficulty breathing. If a young adult develops a pleuraleffusion, the chance of tubercular infection being thecause is very high. The TB bacilli may travel from thelungs to lymph nodes in the sides and back of the neck.Infection in these areas can break through the skin anddischarge pus. Before the development of effectiveantibiotics, many patients became chronically ill withincreasingly severe lung symptoms. They lost a greatdeal of weight and developed a wasted appearance. Thisoutcome is uncommon today—at least where moderntreatment methods are available.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3406TuberculosisExtrapulmonary tuberculosis\nAlthough the lungs are the major site of damage\ncaused by tuberculosis, many other organs and tissues inthe body may be affected. The usual progression is for thedisease to spread from the lungs to locations outside thelungs (extrapulmonary sites). In some cases, however, thefirst sign of disease appears outside the lungs. The manytissues or organs that tuberculosis may affect include:\n• Bones. TB is particularly likely to attack the spine and\nthe ends of the long bones. Children are especiallyprone to spinal tuberculosis. If not treated, the spinalsegments (vertebrae) may collapse and cause paralysis\nin one or both legs. \n• Kidneys. Along with the bones, the kidneys are proba-\nbly the commonest site of extrapulmonary TB. Theremay, however, be few symptoms even though part of akidney is destroyed. TB may spread to the bladder. Inmen, it may spread to the prostate gland and nearbystructures.\n• Female reproductive organs. The ovaries in women may\nbe infected; TB can spread from them to the peritoneum,which is the membrane lining the abdominal cavity.\n• Abdominal cavity. Tuberculous peritonitis may cause\npain ranging from the vague discomfort of stomachcramps to intense pain that may mimic the symptoms ofappendicitis.\n• Joints. Tubercular infection of joints causes a form of\narthritis that most often affects the hips and knees. Thewrist, hand, and elbow joints also may become painfuland inflamed.\n• Meninges. The meninges are tissues that cover the\nbrain and the spinal cord. Infection of the meninges bythe TB bacillus causes tuberculous meningitis , a condi-\ntion that is most common in young children but is espe-cially dangerous in the elderly. Patients developheadaches, become drowsy, and eventually comatose.Permanent brain damage is the rule unless prompt treat-ment is given. Some patients with tuberculous meningi-tis develop a tumor-like brain mass called a tuberculo-ma that can cause stroke-like symptoms.\n• Skin, intestines, adrenal glands, and blood vessels. All\nthese parts of the body can be infected by M. tuberculo-\nsis. Infection of the wall of the body’s main artery (the\naorta), can cause it to rupture with catastrophic results.Tuberculous pericarditis occurs when the membrane\nsurrounding the heart (the pericardium) is infected andfills up with fluid that interferes with the heart’s abilityto pump blood. \n• Miliary tuberculosis. Miliary TB is a life-threatening\ncondition that occurs when large numbers of tuberclebacilli spread throughout the body. Huge numbers of\ntiny tubercular lesions develop that cause markedweakness and weight loss, severe anemia, and gradualwasting of the body.\nDiseases similar to tuberculosis\nThere are many forms of mycobacteria other than M.\ntuberculosis , the tubercle bacillus. Some cause infections\nthat may closely resemble tuberculosis, but they usuallydo so only when an infected person’s immune system isdefective. People who are HIV-positive are a primeexample. The most common mycobacteria that infectAIDS patients are a group known as Mycobacterium\navium complex (MAC). People infected by MAC are not\ncontagious, but they may develop a serious lung infec-tion that is highly resistant to antibiotics. MAC infectionstypically start with the patient coughing up mucus. Theinfection progresses slowly, but eventually blood isbrought up and the patient has trouble breathing. InAIDS patients, MAC disease can spread throughout thebody, with anemia, diarrhea , and stomach pain as com-\nmon features. Often these patients die unless theirimmune system can be strengthened. Other mycobacteriagrow in swimming pools and may cause skin infection.Some of them infect wounds and artificial body parts\nsuch as a breast implant or mechanical heart valve.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of TB is made on the basis of laborato-\nry test results. The standard test for tuberculosis—whichis the so-called tuberculin skin test—detects the presenceof infection, not of active TB. Tuberculin is an extractprepared from cultures of M. tuberculosis . It contains sub-\nstances belonging to the bacillus (antigens) to which aninfected person has been sensitized. When tuberculin isinjected into the skin of an infected person, the areaaround the injection becomes hard, swollen, and red with-in one to three days. Today skin tests utilize a substancecalled purified protein derivative (PPD) that has a stan-dard chemical composition and is therefore is a goodmeasure of the presence of tubercular infection. The PPDtest is also called the Mantoux test. The Mantoux PPDskin test is not, however, 100% accurate; it can producefalse positive as well as false negative results. What theseterms mean is that some people who have a skin reactionare not infected (false positive) and that some who do notreact are in fact infected (false negative). The PPD test is,however, useful as a screener. Anyone who has suspiciousfindings on a chest x ray , or any condition that makes TB\nmore likely should have a PPD test. In addition, those inclose contact with a TB patient and persons who comefrom a country where TB is common also should be test-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3407Tuberculosised, as should all healthcare personnel and those living in\ncrowded conditions or institutions. \nBecause the symptoms of TB cover a wide range of\nseverity and affected body parts, diagnosis on the basisof external symptoms is not always possible. Often, thefirst indication of TB is an abnormal chest x-ray or othertest result rather than physical discomfort. On a chest xray, evidence of the disease appears as numerous white,irregular areas against a dark background, or as enlargedlymph nodes. The upper parts of the lungs are most oftenaffected. A PPD test is always done to show whether thepatient has been infected by the tubercle bacillus. To ver-ify the test results, the physician obtains a sample of spu-tum or a tissue sample (biopsy) for culture. Three to fivesputum samples should be taken early in the morning. Ifnecessary, sputum for culture can be produced by spray-ing salt solution into the windpipe. Culturing M. tubercu-\nlosis is useful for diagnosis because the bacillus has cer-\ntain distinctive characteristics. Unlike many other typesFLORENCE B. SEIBERT (1897–1991)\nof bacteria, mycobacteria can retain certain dyes evenwhen exposed to acid. This so-called acid-fast property ischaracteristic of the tubercle bacillus.\nBody fluids other than sputum can be used for cul-\nture. If TB has invaded the brain or spinal cord, culturinga sample of spinal fluid will make the diagnosis. If TB ofthe kidneys is suspected because of pus or blood in theurine, culture of the urine may reveal tubercular infec-tion. Infection of the ovaries in women can be detectedby placing a tube having a light on its end (a laparo-scope) into the area. Samples also may be taken from theliver or bone marrow to detect the tubercle bacillus.\nTreatment\nSupportive care\nIn the past, treatment of TB was primarily support-\nive.

She was the daughter of George Peter Seibert, a rugmanufacturer and merchant, and Barbara (Memmert) Seib-ert. At the age of three she contracted polio. Despite herresultant handicaps, she completed high school, with thehelp of her highly supportive parents, and entered Gouch-\ner College in Baltimore, where she studied chemistry andzoology. She graduated in 1918, then worked under thedirection of one of her chemistry teachers, Jessie E. Minor,at the Chemistry Laboratory of the Hammersley Paper Millin Garfield, New Jersey. She and her professor, havingresponded to the call for women to fill positions vacatedby men fighting in World War I, coauthored scientificpapers on the chemistry of cellulose and wood pulps.\nA biochemist who received her Ph.D. from Yale Uni-\nversity in 1923, Florence B. Seibert is best known for herresearch in the biochemistry of tuberculosis. She developedthe protein substance used for the tuberculosis skin test. Thesubstance was adopted as the standard in 1941 by the Unit-ed States and a year later by the World Health Organiza-tion. In addition, in the early 1920s, Seibert discovered thatthe sudden fevers that sometimes occurred during intra-venous injections were caused by bacteria in the distilledwater that was used to make the protein solutions. Sheinvented a distillation apparatus that prevented contamina-tion. This research had great practical significance laterwhen intravenous blood transfusions became widely usedin surgery. Seibert authored or coauthored more than a hun-dred scientific papers. Her later research involved the studyof bacteria associated with certain cancers. Her many hon-ors include five honorary degrees, induction into theNational Women’s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York(1990), the Garvan Gold Medal of the American ChemicalSociety (1942), and the John Elliot Memorial Award of theAmerican Association of Blood Banks (1962).\n(Library of Congress.)lapsed surgically so that it could “rest” and heal. Today\nsurgical procedures still are used when necessary, butcontemporary medicine relies on drug therapy as themainstay of home care. Given an effective combinationof drugs, patients with TB can be treated at home as wellas in a sanitorium. Treatment at home does not pose therisk of infecting other household members.\nDrug therapy\nMost patients with TB can recover if given appropri-\nate medication for a sufficient length of time. Three prin-ciples govern modern drug treatment of TB:\n• Lowering the number of bacilli as quickly as possible.\nThis measure minimizes the risk of transmitting the dis-ease. When sputum cultures become negative, this hasbeen achieved. Conversely, if the sputum remains posi-tive after five to six months, treatment has failed.\n• Preventing the development of drug resistance. For this\nreason, at least two different drugs and sometimes threeare always given at first. If drug resistance is suspected,at least two different drugs should be tried. \n• Long-term treatment to prevent relapse.\nFive drugs are most commonly used today to treat\ntuberculosis: isoniazid (INH, Laniazid, Nydrazid);rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane); pyrazinamide (Tebrazid);streptomycin; and ethambutol (Myambutol). The firstthree drugs may be given in the same capsule to mini-KEY TERMS\nBacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) —A vaccine made\nfrom a damaged bacillus akin to the tubercle bacil-lus, which may help prevent serious pulmonary TBand its complications.\nMantoux test —Another name for the PPD test.\nMiliary tuberculosis —The form of TB in which the\nbacillus spreads through all body tissues andorgans, producing many thousands of tiny tubercu-lar lesions.

As of 1998, many\npatients are given INH and rifampin together for sixmonths, with pyrazinamide added for the first twomonths. Hospitalization is rarely necessary becausemany patients are no longer infectious after about twoweeks of combination treatment. Follow-up involvesmonitoring of side effects and monthly sputum tests. Ofthe five medications, INH is the most frequently useddrug for both treatment and prevention.\nSurgery\nSurgical treatment of TB may be used if medications\nare ineffective. There are three surgical treatments forpulmonary TB: pneumothorax, in which air is introducedinto the chest to collapse the lung; thoracoplasty, in whichone or more ribs are removed; and removal of a diseasedlung, in whole or in part. It is possible for patients to sur-vive with one healthy lung. Spinal TB may result in asevere deformity that can be corrected surgically.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from TB is good for\nmost patients, if the disease is diagnosed early and givenprompt treatment with appropriate medications on along-term regimen. Modern surgical methods have agood outcome in most cases in which they are needed.Miliary tuberculosis is still fatal in many cases but israrely seen today in developed countries. Even in cases\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3409Tuberculosisin which the bacillus proves resistant to all of the com-\nmonly used medications for TB, other seldom-useddrugs may be tried because the tubercle bacilli have notyet developed resistance to them.\nPrevention\nGeneral measures\nGeneral measures such as avoidance of overcrowded\nand unsanitary conditions are also necessary aspects ofprevention. Hospital emergency rooms and similar loca-tions can be treated with ultraviolet light, which has anantibacterial effect.\nV accination\nVaccination is one major preventive measure against\nTB. A vaccine called BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin,named after its French developers) is made from a weak-ened mycobacterium that infects cattle. Vaccination withBCG does not prevent infection by M. tuberculosis but it\ndoes strengthen the immune system of first-time TBpatients. As a result, serious complications are less likelyto develop. BCG is used more widely in developing coun-tries than in the United States. The effectiveness of vacci-nation is still being studied; it is not clear whether the vac-cine’s effectiveness depends on the population in which itis used or on variations in its formulation. \nProphylactic use of isoniazid\nINH can be given for the prevention as well as the\ntreatment of TB. INH is effective when given daily over aperiod of 6 to 12 months to people in high-risk cate-gories. INH appears to be most beneficial to personsunder the age of 25. Because INH carries the risk of side-effects (liver inflammation, nerve damage, changes inmood and behavior), it is important to give it only to per-sons at special risk.\nHigh-risk groups for whom isoniazid prevention\nmay be justified include:\n• close contacts of TB patients, including health care\nworkers\n• newly infected patients whose skin test has turned posi-\ntive in the past two years\n• anyone who is HIV-positive with a positive PPD skin test;\nisoniazid may be given even if the PPD results are nega-tive if there is a risk of exposure to active tuberculosis\n• intravenous drug users, even if they are negative for\nHIV\n• persons with positive PPD results and evidence of old\ndisease on the chest x-ray who have never been treatedfor TB• patients who have an illness or are taking a drug that\ncan suppress the immune system\n• persons with positive PPD results who have had intesti-\nnal surgery; have diabetes or chronic kidney failure ;\nhave any type of cancer ; or are more than 10% below\ntheir ideal body weight\n• people from countries with high rates of TB who have\npositive PPD results\n• people from low-income groups with positive skin test\nresults\n• persons with a positive PPD reaction who belong to\nhigh-risk ethnic groups (African Americans, Hispanics,Native Americans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders)\nResources\nBOOKS\nMerck Manual of Medical Information: Home Edition.

    "title": "Tularemia",
    "content": "Tularemia\nDefinition\nTularemia is an illness caused by a bacterium. It\nresults in fever , rash, and greatly enlarged lymph nodes.\nDescription\nTularemia infects a variety of wild animals, includ-\ning rabbits, deer, squirrels, muskrat, and beaver. Humanscan acquire the bacterium directly from contact with theblood or body fluids of these animals, from the bite of a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3410Tularemiatick or fly which has previously fed on the blood of an\ninfected animal, or from contaminated food or water.\nTularemia occurs most often in the summer months. It\nis most likely to infect people who come into contact withinfected animals, including hunters, furriers, butchers, lab-oratory workers, game wardens, and veterinarians. In theUnited States, the vast majority of cases of tularemia occurin the southeastern and Rocky Mountain states.\nCauses and symptoms\nFive types of illness may occur, depending on\nwhere/how the bacteria enter the body:\n• Ulceroglandular/glandular tularemia. seventy-five to 85%\nof all cases are of this type. This type is contracted throughthe bite of an infected tick that has defecated bacteria-laden feces in the area of the bite wound. A tender redbump appears in the area of the original wound. Over afew weeks, the bump develops a punched-out center(ulcer). Nearby lymph nodes grow hugely swollen andvery tender. The lymph nodes may drain a thick, pus-likematerial. Other symptoms include fever, chills, and weak-ness. In adults, the lymph nodes in the groin are most com-monly affected; in children, the lymph nodes in the neck.\n• Oculoglandular tularemia. This type accounts for only\nabout 1% of all cases of tularemia. It occurs when aperson’s contaminated hand rubs his or her eye. Thelining of the eyelids and the surface of the white of theeye (conjunctiva) becomes red and severely painful,with multiple small yellow bumps and pitted sores(ulcers). Lymph nodes around the ears, under the jaw,or in the neck may swell and become painful.\n• Oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal tularemia. This type\noccurs when contaminated meat is undercooked andthen eaten, or when water from a contaminated sourceis drunk. Poor hygiene after skinning and cleaning ananimal obtained through hunting can also lead to thebacteria entering through the mouth. Sores in the mouthand throat, as well as abdominal pain ,nausea and\nvomiting , ulcers in the intestine, intestinal bleeding,\nand diarrhea may all occur. \n• Pulmonary tularemia. This rare type of tularemia\noccurs when a person inhales a spray of infected fluid,or when the bacteria reach the lungs through the bloodcirculation. A severe pneumonia follows.\n• Typhoidal tularemia. This type of tularemia is particu-\nlarly hard to diagnose, because it occurs without theusual skin manifestations or swelling of lymph glands.Symptoms include continuously high fever, terribleheadache , and confusion. The illness may result in a\nseverely low blood pressure, with signs of poor bloodflow to the major organs (shock).KEY TERMS\nConjunctiva —The lining of the eyelids and the\nsurface of the white part of the eye.\nShock —A state in which drastically low blood\npressure prevents adequate blood flow to the tis-sues and organs throughout the body.\nDiagnosis\nSamples from the skin lesions can be prepared with\nspecial stains, to allow identification of the causativebacteria under the microscope. Other tests are availableto demonstrate the presence of antibodies (specialimmune cells that the body produces in response to thepresence of specific foreign invaders) which would beincreasing over time in an infection with tularemia. \nTreatment\nStreptomycin (given as a shot in a muscle) and gen-\ntamicin (given as either a shot in a muscle or through aneedle in the vein) are both used to treat tularemia. Othertypes of antibiotics have been tested, but have often\nresulted in relatively high rates of relapse (20%).\nPrognosis\nWith treatment, death rates from tularemia are\nunder 1%. Without treatment, however, the death ratemay reach 30%. The pneumonia and typhoidal typeshave the worst prognosis without treatment.\nPrevention\nPrevention involves avoiding areas known to harbor\nticks and flies, or the appropriate use of insect repellents.Hunters should wear gloves when skinning animals orpreparing meat. Others (butchers, game wardens, veteri-narians) who work with animals or carcasses shouldalways wear gloves. A vaccine exists, but is usually onlygiven to people at very high risk due to their professionor hobby (veterinarians, laboratory workers, butchers,hunters, game wardens). \nResources\nBOOKS\nJacobs, Richard F. “Tularemia.” In Harrison’s Principles of\nInternal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Tumor markers",
    "content": "Tumor markers\nDefinition\nTumor markers are substances, such as proteins, bio-\nchemicals, or enzymes, produced by tumor cells or bythe body in response to tumor cells. As tumor cells multi-ply,cancer spreads, and tissue is damaged, these sub-\nstances increase and leak into the bloodstream. Tumormarker levels in blood help physicians evaluate peoplefor certain types of cancer.\nPurpose\nTumor marker levels provide evidence about the like-\nlihood of undiagnosed cancer or the status of treated can-cer without the expense and discomfort of ultrasound, x-ray, or biopsy procedures. Tumor marker levels are used toscreen for and diagnose cancer, predict a person’s progno-sis, monitor treatment, and watch for cancer recurrence.\nDescription\nTumor markers associated with common cancers\ninclude: AFP, Beta-HCG, CA 15-3, CA 19-9, CA 27.29,CA 125, CEA, and PSA. Some tumor markers are asso-ciated with many types of cancer; others, with as few asone. Some tumor markers are always elevated in specificcancers; others are less predictable.\nA tumor marker test’s ability to screen for and diag-\nnose a specific type of cancer depends on its sensitivityand specificity. A test that is 100% sensitive has no falsenegatives. It is positive or increased in every person whohas that type of cancer. A test that is 100% specific hasno false positives. It is negative or decreased in everyperson who does not have that type of cancer.\nMost tumor markers are neither sensitive nor specif-\nic enough to screen for or diagnose cancer without thesupport of other clinical findings. Increased levels are notfound in all people with a specific type of cancer, yetmay be found in some people without that type of cancer.In addition, tumor marker levels often do not increaseuntil the person experiences symptoms.\nOnce cancer is diagnosed, tumor marker levels help\ndetermine the amount of cancer present. Higher levels usu-ally indicate more advanced cancer and a worse prognosis.The person and his or her physician use this information tochoose between more or less aggressive treatments.\nMonitoring cancer treatment is the most common\nuse of tumor markers. As cancer is reduced, levelsdecrease. Stable or increasing levels indicate the canceris not responding to treatment.\nThe choice of tumor marker to use for monitoring is\nimportant. Only a marker elevated before treatment canbe used to monitor a person during or after treatment.Timing of the tests is also important. Each tumor markerhas a unique lifespan in the blood. To monitor a treat-ment’s success, enough time must have passed for theinitial marker to be cleared from the blood. Tests donetoo soon may be falsely elevated because the marker pro-duced by the untreated cancer is still present.\nWatching for cancer recurrence is another common\nreason for tumor marker testing. Periodic testing candetect a recurrence often months earlier than could anultrasound, x-ray, or physical examination .\nTumor marker tests usually are done by combining a\nsample of blood with a substance containing antibodiesto the tumor markers. These antibodies bind to the mark-ers. Another substance is added, often a radioactive sub-stance, to measure the amount of bound marker and anti-bodies. From this measurement, the amount of tumormarker is calculated.\nConclusions based on tumor marker tests are seldom\nbased on one test result but on a series of test results,called serial measurements. A series of increasing ordecreasing values is more significant than a single value.\nTumor marker testing is currently the object of much\nresearch. Their use is directed by approval from the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) and guidelines estab-lished by organizations such as the American Society ofClinical Oncology and the American Cancer Society.\nTumor marker test results are available within sever-\nal days. Insurance coverage for markers still in theresearch stage for particular uses may vary with the com-pany and individual policy.\nAlpha-fetoprotein (AFP)\nAFP is a protein normally made by only fetal tissue.\nWhen certain types of cells become cancerous, they revert\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3412Tumor markersto a fetal form and begin making AFP. Increased levels are\nassociated most strongly with liver, testicular, and ovarian\ncancer . Seventy-percent of people with liver cancer have\nincreased AFP levels. Levels indicate the extent of cancer.Serial measurements monitor treatment response.\nPregnant women and people with such noncancer-\nous liver conditions as cirrhosis and hepatitis have mod-\nerately increased levels.\nBeta-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin\n(Beta-HCG)\nThe beta-subunit of the hormone HCG is a marker\nfor testicular cancer and cancers that begin in placental\ncells called trophoblasts. Women with choriocarcinoma\n(a cancer originating in the placenta following pregnan-\ncy) or molar pregnancy (a tumor inside the uterus) have\nincreased levels of Beta-HCG, as do 70% of men withtesticular cancer. Serial measurements monitor theprogress and treatment of these cancers.\nCancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3)\nCA 15-3 is produced by cells in the breast. Increased\nlevels are associated with breast cancer . Rarely\nincreased in women with early breast cancer, it is used todetect recurrence of cancer in women following treat-ment or mastectomy .\nCancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9)\nCA 19-9 helps diagnose pancreatic cancer when\ncombined with other test results and clinical findings.After diagnosis, levels help predict the success of surgeryand to monitor the course of the cancer.\nNot all people with pancreatic cancer have increased\nCA 19-9 levels. This marker is associated with a specificblood type. People with pancreatic cancer who are nega-tive for this blood type will not have CA 19-9 in theirblood. It is also increased in liver and gastrointestinalcancer and in such noncancerous diseases, as pancreati-\ntisand jaundice .\nBreast carcinoma-associated antigen (CA 27.29)\nCA 27.29 is a marker for breast cancer. Eighty per-\ncent of women with breast cancer have an increased CA27.29. Serial measurements monitor treatment responseand identify recurrence.\nLevels may also be increased in noncancerous breast\ndisease and cancers of other tissues. It is not used to screenfor breast cancer because women with small or localizedbreast tumors often have normal CA 27.29 levels.\nCancer antigen 125 (CA 125)\nCA 125 is a protein made by ovarian cells and is a\nmarker for ovarian cancer. Eighty percent of women withovarian cancer have increased CA 125 levels. Although\nthe test is not sensitive and specific enough to be used forscreening, it contributes to a diagnosis when combinedwith an ultrasound and pelvic examination. After diagno-sis and treatment, serial measurements help detectremaining or recurrent cancer. A negative or normalresult, however, does not guarantee the absence of cancer.\nWomen may have increased CA 125 levels during\nmenstruation and pregnancy. Increased levels are alsofound in pelvic inflammatory disease ,endometriosis ,\npancreatitis, liver disease, and non-ovarian cancers.\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)\nCEA is a protein made by fetal tissues, especially\nliver, intestinal, and pancreatic tissue. It disappears bybirth but often reappears when cells from these tissuesbecome cancerous.\nCEA is most often associated with colorectal cancer,\nalthough it is not present in all people with this cancer.Pre-surgery CEA levels help stage the cancer and planthe surgery. After surgery, serial measurements indicatethe surgery’s success and watch for early signs of recur-rence. When CEA is found in other body fluids, such asspinal fluid, it indicates cancer has spread.\nCEA levels may be increased in many types of can-\ncer: gastrointestinal, colorectal, liver, lung, pancreatic,liver, prostate, thyroid, and breast. People with such non-cancerous conditions as cirrhosis or peptic ulcer, andsuch inflammatory intestinal conditions as colitis ordiverticulitis, also may have increased levels.\nProstate specific antigen (PSA)\nPSA is used to screen for prostate cancer . A protein\nproduced by the prostate gland, increased PSA levels areassociated with prostate cancer. Men over the age of 50years are advised to be screened annually for prostatecancer with a digital rectal exam and a PSA test. Men athigh risk for prostate cancer, such as African-Americansor those with a family history, should begin screening atage 40. Once a diagnosis of prostate cancer is made, PSAlevels help determine the stage of the cancer, monitor theresponse to treatment, and watch for recurrence.\nPSA is also increased in benign prostatic hyperplasia\n(BPH), an enlarged prostate condition common in older\nmen. Several calculations of the PSA have been developedto help tell the difference between BPH and prostate can-cer: PSA density, PSA velocity, and ratio of free to total.\nThe PSA density calculates the concentration of PSA\nin the prostate gland. The volume of prostate gland isdetermined by a procedure called transrectal ultrasound(TRUS). A person with an enlarged prostate, as seen inBPH, has a lower PSA density than a person with prostate\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3413Tumor markerscancer. PSA velocity or rate calculates the change in PSA\nlevels over time. A rapid increase in PSA is more likelydue to cancer than BPH. The ratio of free PSA to totalPSA also helps distinguish BPH from cancer. PSA existseither in a free state or bound to another substance. Thepercentage of free PSA is greater in BPH than cancer.\nPSA levels may increase after ejaculation. Men are\nrecommended to abstain from sexual intercourse or mas-turbation for 48 hours before the test. PSA levels mayalso increase after prostate manipulation following thedigital rectal exam.\nPreparation\nTumor marker tests require 5–10 mL of blood. A\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upperarm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and insertsa needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.\nAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site relieve discomfort.\nNormal results\nAFP:KEY TERMS\nAFP (Alpha-fetoprotein) —A tumor marker associat-\ned with liver, testicular, and ovarian cancer.\nBeta-HCG (Beta-human chorionic\ngonadotropin) —A tumor marker associated with\ntesticular cancer and tumors, such as choriocarci-noma and molar pregnancies, that begin in placen-tal cells called trophoblasts.\nCA 15-3 (Cancer antigen 15-3) —A tumor marker\nassociated with breast cancer.\nCA 19-9 (Cancer antigen 19-9) —A tumor marker\nassociated with pancreatic cancer.\nCA 27.29 (Breast carcinoma-associated antigen) —\nA tumor marker associated with breast cancer.\nCA 125 (Cancer antigen 125) —A tumor marker\nassociated with ovarian cancer.CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen) —A tumor marker\nassociated with many cancers, especially liver,intestinal, and pancreatic.\nPSA (Prostate specific antigen) —A tumor marker\nassociated with prostate cancer.\nSensitivity —A test’s ability to detect all cases of a\ndisease.\nSerial measurements —A series of measurements\nlooking for an increase or decrease over time.\nSpecificity —A test’s ability to detect only the dis-\nease in question.\nTumor markers —Substances, such as proteins, bio-\nchemicals, or enzymes, produced by tumor cells orby the body in response to tumor cells. Their levelsin the blood help physicians evaluate people forcertain kinds of cancer.\n• 99% of nonpregnant people have less than 15 ng/mL\n• 95% have less than 6 ng/mL\nBeta-HCG:\n• Males less than 2.5 IU/L\n• Female less than 5.0 IU/L• Postmenopausal female less than 9.0 IU/L\nCA 15-3:\n• females have less than 40 U/mL\nCA 19-9:\n• less than 40 U/mL\nCA 27.29:\n• less than or equal to 5 ng/mL\nPSA:\n• less than 4 ng/mL (PSA levels increase with age) \nAbnormal results\nThe meaning of an increased tumor marker level\ndepends on the specific marker, the person’s medical histo-ry, and why the test was done.

    "content": "Tumor removal\nDefinition\nTumor removal is a surgical procedure to remove an\nabnormal growth.\nPurpose\nA tumor can be either benign, like a wart, or malig-\nnant, in which case it is a cancer . Benign tumors are wellcircumscribed and are generally easy to remove com-\npletely. In contrast, cancers pose some of the most diffi-cult problems in all of surgery.\nCurrently 40% of all cancers are treated with surgery\nalone. In 55%, surgery is combined with other treat-ments—usually radiation therapy or chemotherapy .\nThe doctor needs to decide if surgery should be done\nat all. Because cancers spread (metastasize) to normal tis-sues, sometimes at the other end of the body, the ability ofsurgery to cure must be addressed at the outset. As long asthe cancer is localized, the initial presumption is that cureshould be attempted by removing it as soon as possible.\nNon-curative surgery may make other treatments more\neffective. “Debulking” a cancer—making it smaller—isthought to assist radiation and chemotherapy to get to theremaining pieces of the cancer and be more effective.\nAnother important function surgery performs in can-\ncer treatment is accurately assessing the nature and extentof the cancer. Most cancers cannot be adequately identi-fied without a piece being placed under a microscope.This piece is obtained by surgery. Surgery is also the onlyway to determine exactly how far the tumor has spread.There are a few standard methods of comparing one can-cer to another for the purposes of comparing treatmentsand estimating outcomes. These methods are called “stag-ing.” The most universal method is the TNM system.\n• “T” stands for “tumor” and reflects the size of the tumor. \n• “N” represents the spread of the cancer to lymph nodes,\nlargely determined by those nodes removed at surgerythat contain cancer cells. Since cancers spread mostlythrough the lymph system, this is a useful measure oftheir ability to disperse. \n• “M” refers to the metastases, how far they are from the\noriginal cancer and how often they have multiplied.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3415Tumor removal\nA tumor inside the brain is being removed. (Photograph by\nJennifer Watson-Holton, Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-duced by permission.)Other methods of staging include Duke’s method and\nsimilar systems, which add to the above criteria the degreeof invasion of the cancer into the surrounding tissues.\nStaging is particularly important with such lymphomas\nas Hodgkin’s disease . These cancers may appear in many\nplaces in the lymphatic system. Because they are veryradiosensitive, radiation treatment is often curative if all thecancer is irradiated. Therefore, it must all be located.Surgery is a common, usually essential, method of perform-ing this staging. If the disease is too widespread, the stagingprocedure will dictate chemotherapy instead of radiation.\nPrecautions\nCurative cancer surgery demands special considera-\ntions. There is a danger of spreading or seeding the cancerduring the process of removing it. Presuming the cancercells can grow almost anywhere in the body they end up,the surgeon must not “spill” cells into the operating fieldor “knock them loose” into the blood stream. Special tech-\nniques called “block resection” and “no touch” are used.Block resection means taking the entire specimen out as asingle piece. “No touch” means that only the normal tissueremoved with specimen is handled; the cancer itself isnever touched. This prevents “squeezing” cancer cells outinto the circulation. Further, in this technique pains aretaken to clamp off the blood supply first, preventing cellsfrom leaving by that route later in the surgery.\nDescription\nDiagnostic biopsies\nThere are four types of biopsy techniques:\n• Aspiration biopsy. A needle is inserted into the tumor\nand a sample is withdrawn. \n• Needle biopsy. A special cutting needle is inserted into\nthe core of the tumor and a core sample is cut out. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3416Tumor removal\nBenign tumors are generally\nself-contained and localizedand have a well-definedperimeter.\nThey grow slowly,expanding outwardfrom a central mass.They are dangerous when they\ncompress surrounding tissues.A benign tumor near a bloodvessel could restrict the flow ofblood; in the abdomen it couldimpair digestion; in the brain itcould cause paralysis.\nMalignant tumors are\nnot self-contained, andusually do not compresssurrounding tissues. Theirgrowth is an irregularinvasion of adjacent cells.\nAlthough they maygrow slowly, they arealso capable of veryrapid growth. They are not localized; ina process called metastasisthey shed cells that travelthrough the bloodstreamand infect tissues at otherlocations. They can evenestablish malignant growthin a different type of tissue;a breast cancer can spreadto bone tissue, for example.\nA comparison of benign (top of illustration) and malignant tumor characteristics. (Illustration by Hans & Cassady, Inc.)• Incisional biopsy. A portion of a large tumor is\nremoved, usually before complete tumor removal. \n• Excisional biopsy. A whole lesion is removed along\nwith surrounding normal tissue.\nComplete tumor removal\nOnce surgical removal has been decided, an oncolog-\nic surgeon will remove the tumor whole, taking with it alarge section of the surrounding normal tissue. The healthytissue is removed to minimize the risk of possible seeding.\nCytoreduction\nWhen surgical removal of a tumor is unacceptable as\na sole treatment, a portion of the tumor is removed to“debulk” the mass. Debulking aids radiation and chemo-therapy treatments.\nAftercare\nRetesting and periodical examinations are necessary\nto ensure that a tumor has not reformed after total removal.\nRisks\nThe possibility of mestastasis and seeding are risks\nthat have to be considered in consultation with an oncol-ogist.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLongo, Dan D. “Approach to the Patient with Cancer.” In Har-\nrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Turner syndrome",
    "content": "Turner syndrome\nDefinition\nTurner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder affect-\ning females wherein one of the two X-chromosomes isdefective or completely absent.\nDescription\nChromosomes are structures in the nucleus of every\ncell in the human body. Chromosomes contain the genet-ic information necessary to direct the growth and normalfunctioning of all cells and systems of the body. A nor-mal individual has a total of 46 chromosomes in eachcell, two of which are responsible for determining gen-der. Normally, females have two X-chromosomes andmales have one X and one Y-chromosome.\nIn Turner syndrome, an error occurring very early in\ndevelopment results in an abnormal number and arrange-ment of chromosomes. Most commonly, an individualwith Turner syndrome will be born with 45 chromo-somes in each cell rather than 46. The missing chromo-some is an X-chromosome. The affected person isalways female.\nThe prevalence of Turner syndrome is widely report-\ned as being approximately one per 2,000 live femalebirths although researchers have reported prevalencerates that range from one in 3,125 to one in 5,000 livefemale births.\nAbout 1% to 2% of all female conceptions have a\nmissing X-chromosome. Of these, the majority (99%)spontaneously abort, usually during the first trimester ofpregnancy . With ultrasound being used more frequently,\nresearchers have realized that some pregnancies with amissing X-chromosome that progress into the secondtrimester are associated with nuchal cysts, severe lym-\nphedema , or hydrops fetalis. These pregnancies are\nassociated with a high frequency of fetal death .\nCauses and symptoms\nTurner’s syndrome is a disorder associated with\ncharacteristic defects in the X-chromosome. The mostcommon presentation is a female with a single X-chro-mosome and an absent X-chromosome. A Greek studyfrom 1999 reported that the intact X-chromosome was aslikely to come from the mother as from the father. Thismeans that there is no parental pattern of responsibilityfor the missing or defective X-chromosome.\nAnother less common genetic pattern for Turner\nSyndrome (35%) is a mosaic. A Danish study reportedthat mosaicism has an effect on malformations that areassociated with Turner syndrome. Research reported in1997 noted that the karyotype can have a significanteffect on the growth of children with Turner syndrome.\nThe exact location of the genes on the X-chromo-\nsome involved in Turner syndrome has not been deter-mined as of 2001. At present, evidence exists that there isa locus for stature on the distal portion of the short arm;there are loci for normal ovarian function on both theshort and long arms; and there are loci contributing tofetal viability on the long arm of X.\nTurner syndrome is characterized by retarded\ngrowth that leads to a small stature and frequent infertili-\nty. Individuals with Turner syndrome report an increased\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3417Turner syndromeincidence of fractures in childhood and osteoporotic\nfractures in adulthood. The incidence of diabetes melli-\ntus(both insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent\nvarieties) has been reported to be increased in Turnersyndrome. Ischemic heart disease, stroke and hyperten-\nsion are also more common.\nGrowth in children with Turner syndrome is charac-\nterized by a slight intrauterine growth retardation , rel-\natively normal growth rates for the first several years oflife, a progressive deceleration of growth later in child-hood, and the lack of a pubertal growth spurt. Growthpatterns of Chinese girls with Turner syndrome parallelthose of Caucasians, although their ultimate height is stillless than normal.\nContrary to earlier reports, most individuals with\nTurner syndrome are not mentally retarded. They mayhave some learning disabilities, particularly with regardto spatial perception, visual-motor coordination, andmathematics. As a result, the nonverbal IQ in Turner syn-drome tends to be lower than the verbal IQ.\nCardiovascular malformations are well-recognized\ncongenital anomalies in Turner syndrome. Dilation anddissection of the aorta are reported in approximately halfof women with Turner syndrome. Because of the poten-tial consequences of aortic dilation, some experts recom-mend screening all individuals with Turner syndrome.However, the specific timing for this screening remainscontroversial in 2001.Juvenile arthritis , an autoimmune condition, has\nbeen recently (1998) associated with Turner syndrome.The prevalence seems to be at least six times greater thanwould be expected if the two conditions were only ran-domly associated. Women with Turner syndrome have anelevated prevalence rate of dental caries and such otherperiodontal conditions as gum disease and plaque.\nNormal pubertal development and spontaneous\nmenstrual periods do not occur in the majority of chil-dren with Turner’ syndrome. It is estimated that 3–8% ofgirls with a single X-chromosome and 12–21% offemales with sex chromosome mosaicism may have nor-mal pubertal development and spontaneous menstrualperiods. A few pregnancies have been reported in womenwith Turner syndrome.\nDiagnosis\nTurner syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of genet-\nic analysis of chromosomes. This can be done prior tobirth. However, the predictive value of amniocentesis in\ndiagnosing Turner syndrome varies from 21–67%. Thereis no significant relation between the mother’s age andrisk of Turner’s syndrome.\nTreatment\nBecause it is so dangerous, experts suggest screen-\ning for aortic dissection , although the specific timing for\nthis screening is controversial. Plastic surgery to correctwebbing of the neck should be considered at an early age(before entering school) for girls with Turner syndrome.\nMost individuals with Turner syndrome require\nfemale hormone therapy to promote development of sec-ondary sexual characteristics and menstruation. The timeof beginning therapy varies with individuals. Experts rec-ommend that therapy begin when a woman expressesconcern about her onset of puberty .\nAll women receiving long-term, exogenous female\nhormone therapy require periodic gynecological exami-nations, because those with Turner syndrome have anincreased risk of developing neoplasms such asgonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma, which arise fromtheir rudimentary streak gonads.\nPrognosis\nMost women with Turner syndrome can live rela-\ntively normal lives. The prognosis for a person withTurner syndrome is dependent on other conditions thatmay be present. Care must be taken to regularly monitorthem for the health problems that are associated withTurner syndrome. For example, heart or kidney defects,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3418Turner syndrome\nA low hairline at the back of the neck is one of several char-\nacteristics of Turner syndrome. (Custom Medical Stock Photo.\nReproduced by permission.)hearing loss , or the development of inflammatory bowel\ndisease may significantly impact the quality of life. With-out these types of conditions, however, their lifeexpectancy is normal. Support will be necessary to helpan adolescent girl cope with body image issues and tohelp some women accept the fact that they will never beable to have children.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHall, Judith G. “Chromosomal Clinical Abnormalities.” In Nel-\nson Textbook of Pediatrics, edited by Richard E Behrman,\net al. 16th ed.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, PhD, DrPH\nTwins seeMultiple pregnancy\n2,3-diphosphoglycerate test\nDefinition\n2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) is a substance\nmade in the red blood cells. It controls the movement ofoxygen from red blood cells to body tissues. 2,3-DPGtesting is done to help investigate both a deficiency in redblood cells (anemia) and an unexplained increase of redblood cells, called erythrocytosis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 34192,3-diphosphoglycerate testPurpose\nHemoglobin, the protein in the blood that carries\noxygen, uses 2,3-DPG to control how much oxygen isreleased once the blood gets out into the tissues. Themore 2,3-DPG in the cell, the more oxygen is deliveredto body tissues. Conversely, the less 2,3-DPG in the cell,the less oxygen is delivered. \nIncreasing the amount of 2,3-DPG is the body’s prima-\nry way of responding to a lack of oxygen. Anemia, obstruc-tive lung disease, cystic fibrosis , and congenital heart dis-\nease are all accompanied by increases in 2,3-DPG. When\nmore oxygen is required because of increased metabolism,such as in hyperthyroidism , more 2,3-DPG is produced.\nDecreased 2,3-DPG results from an inherited lack of\nthe red blood cell enzymes 2,3-DPG mutase and 2,3-DPGphosphatase. These enzymes are needed to make 2,3-DPG. Without 2,3-DPG to control the movement of oxy-gen to its tissues, the body responds by making more redblood cells, a condition called erythrocytosis. The outsidemembrane of the cell is weakened, causing it to have anirregular shape and burst, or hemolyze, easily. This condi-tion is called nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia .\n2,3-DPG levels are important in large blood transfu-\nsions, because stored blood quickly loses 2,3-DPG and itsability to deliver oxygen. After transfusion , the red cells\nrebuild the 2,3-DPG, but it takes about 24 hours to regaina normal level of 2,3-DPG and hemoglobin function.\nDescription\nIn the laboratory, a person’s serum is mixed with a\nsubstance that will react with 2,3-DPG. The end productof this reaction is measured; and from that measurement,the amount of 2,3-DPG in the person’s serum is deter-mined. Results are usually available the next day.\nPreparation\nThis test requires drawing 5-10 mL of blood. The\npatient should not exercise before having the blood\ndrawn. Exercise increases the body’s need for oxygen andcould cause a temporary increase in levels of 2,3-DPG.\nAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite, or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort.\nNormal results\nNormal results will vary based on the laboratory and\ntesting methods used.KEY TERMS\nAnemia —A reduction in the number of erythro-\ncytes or red blood cells. Erythrocytes are necessaryto form hemoglobin for transporting oxygen.\nErythrocytosis —Increased production of red\nblood cells.\nHemoglobin —A protein within the red blood cell\nthat carries oxygen.\nNonspherocytic hemolytic anemia —Anemia\ncaused by variably shaped red blood cells thatburst, or hemolyze, easily.\nAbnormal results\nDecreased levels of 2,3-DPG are found in cases of\nerythrocytosis and nonspherocytic hemolytic anemiacaused by 2,3-DPG mutase and 2,3-DPG phosphatasedeficiencies. Lower levels are also commonly found afterlarge blood transfusions.\nIncreased levels of 2,3-DPG are found in conditions\nin which the body needs more oxygen, such as anemia,obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, congenital heartdisease, and hyperthyroidism. High altitudes and partici-pating in exercise sessions before the test can also givefalse high values.\nResources\nBOOKS\nClinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods.\n19th ed. Ed.

S. typhi is in the same family of\nbacteria as the type spread by chicken and eggs, com-monly known as “salmonella poisoning,” or food poi-\nsoning . S. typhi bacteria do not have vomiting and diar-\nrhea as the most prominent symptoms of their presence\nin humans. Instead, persistently high fever is the hall-mark of S. typhi infection. \nDescription\nS. typhi bacteria are passed into the stool and urine\nof infected patients. They may continue to be present inthe stool of asymptomatic carriers, who are persons whohave recovered from the symptoms of the disease butcontinue to carry the bacteria. This carrier state occurs inabout 3% of all individuals recovered from typhoid fever.\nTyphoid fever is passed from person to person\nthrough poor hygiene, such as incomplete or no handwashing after using the toilet. Persons who are carriers ofthe disease and who handle food can be the source of epi-demic spread of typhoid. One such individual gave hername to the expression “Typhoid Mary,” a name given tosomeone whom others avoid.\nTyphoid fever is a particularly difficult problem in\nparts of the world with poor sanitation practices. In theUnited States, most patients who contract typhoid feverhave recently returned from travel to another countrywhere typhoid is much more common, including Mexi-co, Peru, Chile, India, and Pakistan.\nCauses and symptoms\nS. typhi must be ingested to cause disease. Transmis-\nsion often occurs when a person in the carrier state doesnot wash hands thoroughly (or not at all) after defecationand serves food to others. This pathway is sometimescalled the fecal-oral route of disease transmission. Incountries where open sewage is accessible to flies, theinsects land on the sewage, pick up the bacteria, and thencontaminate food to be eaten by humans.\nAfter being swallowed, the S. typhi bacteria head\ndown the digestive tract, where they are taken in by cellscalled mononuclear phagocytes. These phagocytes arecells of the immune system, whose job it is to engulf andkill invading bacteria and viruses. In the case of S. typhi ,\nhowever, the bacteria are able to survive ingestion by thephagocytes, and multiply within these cells. This periodof time, during which the bacteria are multiplying withinthe phagocytes, is the 10- to 14-day incubation period oftyphoid fever. When huge numbers of bacteria fill anindividual phagocyte, they spill out of the cell and intothe bloodstream, where their presence begins to causesymptoms.\nThe presence of increasingly large numbers of bac-\nteria in the bloodstream ( bacteremia ) is responsible for\nan increasingly high fever, which lasts throughout thefour to eight weeks of the disease in untreated individu-als. Other symptoms of typhoid fever include constipa-\ntion (at first), extreme fatigue ,headache , joint pain , and\na rash across the abdomen known as rose spots.\nThe bacteria move from the bloodstream into certain\ntissues of the body, including the gallbladder and lymphtissue of the intestine (called Peyer’s patches). The tis-sue’s response to this invasion causes symptoms rangingfrom inflammation of the gallbladder ( cholecystitis ) to\nintestinal bleeding to actual perforation of the intestine.Perforation of the intestine refers to an actual hole occur-ring in the wall of the intestine, with leakage of intestinalcontents into the abdominal cavity. This leakage causessevere irritation and inflammation of the lining of theabdominal cavity, which is called peritonitis . Peritonitis\nis a frequent cause of death from typhoid fever.\nOther complications of typhoid fever include liver\nand spleen enlargement, sometimes so great that thespleen ruptures or bursts; anemia, or low red blood cellcount due to blood loss from the intestinal bleeding;joint infections, which are especially common in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3421Typhoid fever\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) scan of Salmonel-\nla typhi, the bacteria which causes typhoid fever in humans.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)patients with sickle cell anemia and immune system dis-\norders; pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection—\nusually Streptococcus pneumoniae — which is able to\ntake hold due to the patient’s weakened state; heartinfections; and meningitis and infections of the brain,\nwhich cause mental confusion and even coma . It may\ntake a patient several months to recover fully fromuntreated typhoid fever.\nDiagnosis\nIn some cases, the doctor may suspect the diagnosis\nif the patient has already developed the characteristicrose spots, or if he or she has a history of recent travel inareas with poor sanitation. The diagnosis, however, isconfirmed by a blood culture . Samples of a patient’s\nstool, urine, and bone marrow can also be used to growS. typhi in a laboratory for identification under a micro-\nscope. Cultures are the most accurate method of diagno-sis. Blood cultures usually become positive in the firstweek of illness in 80% of patients who have not takenantibiotics . \nTreatment\nAntibiotics are the treatment of choice for typhoid\nfever. Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) is the mosteffective medication for S. typhi . The patient’s symp-\ntoms begin to improve slightly after only 24-48 hours ofreceiving the medication. Another drug, ceftriaxone(Rocephin), has been used as well, and is also extremelyeffective. It lowers fever fairly quickly.\nCarriers of S. typhi must be treated even when they\ndo not show any symptoms of the infection, because car-riers are responsible for the majority of new cases oftyphoid fever. Eliminating the carrier state is actually afairly difficult task. It requires treatment with one or eventwo different medications over a period of four to sixweeks. In the case of a carrier with gallstones , surgery\nmay need to be performed to remove the gallbladder.This measure is necessary because typhoid bacteria areoften housed in the gallbladder, where they may survivein spite of antibiotic treatment.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery is good for most\npatients. In the era before effective antibiotics were dis-covered, about 12% of all typhoid fever patients died ofthe infection. Now, however, fewer than 1% of patientswho receive prompt antibiotic treatment will die. Themortality rate is highest in the very young and very old,and in patients suffering from malnutrition . The most\nominous signs are changes in a patient’s state of con-sciousness, including stupor or coma.KEY TERMS\nAsymptomatic —A state in which a person experi-\nences no symptoms of a disease.\nBacteremia —Bacteria in the blood.\nCarrier —A person who has a particular disease\nagent present within his/her body, and can passthis agent on to others, but who displays no symp-toms of infection.\nEpidemic —A large number of cases of the same\ndisease or infection all occurring within a shorttime period in a specific location.\nMononuclear phagocyte —A type of cell of the\nhuman immune system that ingests bacteria, virus-es, and other foreign matter, thus removing poten-tially harmful substances from the bloodstream.These substances are usually then digested withinthe phagocyte.\nRose spots —A pinkish rash across the trunk or\nabdomen that is a classic sign of typhoid fever.\nPrevention\nHygienic sewage disposal systems in a community\nas well as proper personal hygiene are the most impor-tant factors in preventing typhoid fever. Immunizationsare available for travelers who expect to visit countrieswhere S. typhi is a known public health problem. Some\nof these immunizations provide only short-term protec-tion (for a few months), while others may be effective forseveral years. Efforts are being made to develop immu-nizations that provide a longer period of protection withfewer side effects from the vaccine itself.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Salmonellosis.” In Sherris Medical Microbiology: An Intro-\nduction to Infectious Diseases. 3rd ed.

Each illness occurs when the bacteria is passed toa human through contact with an infected insect. \nDescription\nThe four main types of typhus are:\n• epidemic typhus • Brill-Zinsser disease \n• endemic or murine typhus \n•scrub typhus\nThese diseases are all somewhat similar, although\nthey vary in terms of severity. The specific type of Rick-\nettsia that causes the disease also varies, as does the spe-\ncific insect that can pass the bacteria along.\nEpidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii ,\nwhich is carried by body lice. When the lice feed on ahuman, they may simultaneously defecate. When the per-son scratches the bite, the feces (which carry the bacteria)are scratched into the wound. Body lice are common inareas in which people live in overcrowded, dirty condi-tions, with few opportunities to wash themselves or theirclothing. Because of this fact, this form of typhus occurssimultaneously in large numbers of individuals livingwithin the same community; that is, in epidemics. Thistype of typhus occurs when cold weather, poverty, war,and other disasters result in close living conditions thatencourage the maintenance of a population of lice livingamong humans. Epidemic typhus is now found in themountainous regions of Africa, South America, and Asia. \nBrill-Zinsser disease is a reactivation of an earlier infec-\ntion with epidemic typhus. It affects people years after theyhave completely recovered from epidemic typhus. Whensomething causes a weakening of their immune system (likeaging , surgery, illness), the bacteria can gain hold again,\ncausing illness. This illness tends to be extremely mild.\nEndemic typhus is carried by fleas. When a flea lands\non a human, it may defecate as it feeds. When the personscratches the itchy spot where the flea was feeding, thebacteria-laden feces are scratched into the skin, thus caus-ing infection. The causative bacteria is called Rickettsia\ntyphi . Endemic typhus occurs most commonly in warm,\ncoastal regions. In the United States, southern Texas andsouthern California have the largest number of cases.\nScrub typhus is caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi .\nThis bacteria is carried by mites or chiggers. As the mitesfeed on humans, they deposit the bacteria. Scrub typhusoccurs commonly in the southwest Pacific, southeastAsia, and Japan. It is a very common cause of illness inpeople living in or visiting these areas. It occurs morecommonly during the wet season.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe four types of typhus cause similar types of ill-\nnesses, though varying in severity.\nEpidemic typhus causes fever ,headache , weakness,\nand muscle aches. It also causes a rash composed of bothspots and bumps. The rash starts on the back, chest, andabdomen, then spreads to the arms and legs. The worsttypes of complications involve swelling in the heart mus-cle or brain ( encephalitis ). Without treatment, this type\nof typhus can be fatal.\nBrill-Zinsser disease is quite mild, resulting in about\na week-long fever, and a light rash similar to that of theoriginal illness.\nEndemic typhus causes about 12 days of high fever,\nwith chills and headache. A light rash may occur.\nScrub typhus causes a wide variety of effects. The\nmain symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches andpains, cough , abdominal pain,nausea and vomiting , and\ndiarrhea . Some patients experience only these symptoms.\nSome patients develop a rash, which can be flat or bumpy.The individual spots eventually develop crusty blackscabs. Other patients go on to develop a more serious dis-ease, in which encephalitis, pneumonia , and swelling of\nthe liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) occur.\nDiagnosis\nA number of tests exist that can determine the reac-\ntions of a patient’s antibodies (immune cells in the blood)to the presence of certain viral and bacterial markers.When the antibodies react in a particular way, it suggeststhe presence of a rickettsial infection. Many tests requirea fair amount of time for processing, so practitioners willfrequently begin treatment without completing tests,simply on the basis of a patient’s symptoms.\nTreatment\nThe antibiotics tetracycline or chloramphenicol are\nused for treatment of each of the forms of typhus.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on what types of complica-\ntions an individual patient experiences. While childrenusually recover well from epidemic typhus, older adults\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3423Typhusmay have as much as a 60% death rate without treat-\nment. Brill-Zinsser, on the other hand, carries no threatof death. People usually recover uneventfully fromendemic typhus, although the elderly, those with othermedical problems, or people mistakenly treated withsulfa drugs may have a 1% death rate from the illness.Scrub typhus responds well to appropriate treatment, butuntreated patients have a death rate of about 7%.\nPrevention\nPrevention for each of these forms of typhus\nincludes avoidance of the insects that carry the causativebacteria. Other preventive measures include goodhygiene and the use of insect repellents.\nResources\nBOOKS\nWalker, David, et al. “Rickettsial Diseases.” In Harrison’s\nPrinciples of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "content": "Tzanck preparation\nDefinition\nTzanck preparation is a rapid test done to diagnose\ninfections caused by herpesviruses. Cells are examinedunder a microscope for signs of infection.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —Specialized cells of the immune sys-\ntem, which can recognize organisms that invadethe body (such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi). Theantibodies are then able to set off a complex chainof events designed to kill these foreign invaders.\nEndemic —Occurring naturally and consistently in\na particular area.\nEpidemic —A large cluster of cases all occurring at\nabout the same time within a specific communityor region.Purpose\nHerpesviruses are responsible for several superficial\ninfections. Varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox and\nshingles , herpes simplex type 1 causes the common cold\nsore or fever blister, and herpes simplex type 2 causes\nthe sexually transmitted disease genital herpes . They are\nall characterized by blisters and ulcers.\nPhysicians usually can diagnose herpes infections sim-\nply by looking at the type of blisters and ulcers, and theirdistribution on the person’s body. Sometimes laboratoryevidence of herpes is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Forexample, herpes can be devastating to a newborn baby or aperson with a weakened immune system. Treatment canbegin once herpes is confirmed in a laboring mother’s geni-tal ulcers or in the skin blisters of an immunocompromisedperson. A lab tries to grow (culture) the virus that may bepresent in the blister. This lab test takes several days tocomplete, but the Tzanck preparation takes minutes.\nDescription\nThe Tzanck preparation is done by smearing cells\ntaken from a fresh blister or ulcer onto a microscope slide.The cells are stained with a special stain, such as Wright’sstain, and then examined under a microscope for charac-teristic changes caused by a herpesvirus. Herpes causesgiant cells with multiple nuclei. The shape of each nucle-us appears molded to fit together with those adjacent. Thebackground of the cell looks like ground glass and con-tains small dark spots called inclusion bodies.\nTzanck preparation is also called a Tzanck smear,\nherpes stain for inclusion bodies, or inclusion bodiesstain. Results are available the same or following day,often within minutes.\nPreparation\nA fresh blister is opened with a scalpel or sterile\nneedle. The physician scrapes the base of the blister withthe scalpel, gathers as much cellular material as possible,and gently spreads it on a microscope slide.\nNormal results\nA normal smear shows no evidence of a herpes\ninfection. This test may also have false negatives. Studieshave shown that the Tzanck preparation shows signs ofinfection in only 50–79% of people with a herpes infec-tion. A negative Tzanck preparation may have to be con-firmed by a herpes culture.\nAbnormal results\nA smear that shows evidence of herpes infection\ndoes not distinguish between the various infections\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3424Tzanck preparationcaused by herpes virus. The physician uses the person’s\nsymptoms and other clinical findings to distinguishbetween these infections.

H. pylori can be eliminat-\ned from most patients with a combination of antibiotics and bismuth. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Precautions\nThere is a tumor of the pancreas that produces a hor-\nmone called gastrin. Gastrin causes ulcers by stimulatingacid production. If this disease—Zollinger-Ellison syn-drome—does not respond to medical treatment, eitherthe tumor or the entire stomach must be removed.\nDescription\nThe two primary goals of ulcer surgery, elimination\nof the current problem and prevention of future problemsbring with them a third problem—to perpetuate the nor-mal function of the bowel. The vagus nerves relax thepylorus, allowing the stomach to empty. Cutting thevagus nerves, while reducing the stomach’s acid produc-tion, also prevents stomach emptying. Therefore, the pro-cedures described must guarantee stomach emptyingalong with their other goals.\nTotal gastrectomy\nRemoving the entire stomach is done only for resis-\ntant Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or extensive cancers. \nAntrectomy\nThe lower half of the stomach makes most of the\nacid and gets all the peptic ulcers above the duodenum.Removing it leaves little place for ulcers to form and lit-tle acid to produce them.\nV agotomy\nCutting the vagus nerves can be done in three ways:\n• The main nerves can be cut completely as they enter the\nabdomen from the chest.\n• The branches that go to the stomach can be cut as they\nleave the main nerves.\n• The tiny branches that stimulate acid production can be\ncut on the surface of the stomach.\nPyloroplasty\nOpening up the valve at the outlet of the stomach\nguarantees that the stomach can empty, even withoutvagus nerve stimulation. Pyloroplasty is ordinarily done\nby cutting across the muscle that surrounds the outlet. Itcan also be done by passing a balloon down from themouth and inflating it forcefully to stretch out thepylorus (opening from the stomach to the intestine).\nClose perforation\nFor some patients all that can be done is to close the\nhole in the bowel and wait for the patient to recoverbefore initiating corrective surgery.Billroth I and II\nAfter removing a piece of the stomach, the remain-\nder must be reattached to the rest of the bowel. Simplyjoining the upper stomach back to the duodenum iscalled a Billroth I or gastroduodenostomy. It is some-times better to attach the stomach with another piece ofbowel (the jejunum), creating a “y” with the biledrainage and the duodenum forming the second branchof the “y.” This part of the procedure is called a gastroje-junostomy. A gastroenterostomy is a more general termfor connecting the stomach with any piece of bowel.\nA selective vagotomy can be done alone. A com-\nplete vagotomy requires either a pyloroplasty or antrec-tomy. An antrectomy must be reconnected with either aBillroth I or a Billroth II. \nSome of these procedures are now being done\nthrough a laparoscope.\nRisks\nAll of these procedures carry risks, generally in pro-\nportion to their benefits. The more extensive surgeriessuch as vagotomy and antrectomy with Billroth II recon-nection have the highest success rate and the highestcomplication rate. \nComplications include:\n• Diarrhea after a meal• Dumping syndrome occurring after a meal and charac-\nterized by sweating, abdominal pain , vomiting, light-\nheadedness, and diarrhea\n• Hypoglycemia after a meal• Alkaline reflux gastritis marked by abdominal pain,\nvomiting of bile, diminished appetite, and iron-defi-ciency anemia\n• Recurrence of an ulcer• Malabsorption of necessary nutrients, especially iron,\nin patients who have had all or part of their stomachsremoved.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDebas, Haile T., and Susan L.

    "title": "Ulcerative colitis",
    "content": "Ulcerative colitis\nDefinition\nUlcerative colitis is a form of inflammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD). It causes swelling, ulcerations, and loss offunction of the large intestine.\nDescription\nThe primary problem in IBD is inflammation, as the\nname suggests. Inflammation is a process that oftenoccurs in order to fight off foreign invaders in the body,including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. In response tosuch organisms, the body’s immune system begins toproduce a variety of cells and chemicals intended to stopthe invasion. These immune cells and chemicals, howev-er, also have direct effects on the body’s tissues, resultingin heat, redness, swelling, and loss of function. No oneknows what starts the cycle of inflammation in IBD, butthe result is a swollen, boggy intestine.\nIn ulcerative colitis, the inflammation affects the lin-\ning of the rectum and large intestine. It is thought that theinflammation begins in the last segment of large intes-tine, which empties into the rectum (sigmoid colon). ThisKEY TERMS\nGastrin —A type of hormone that produces gastric\njuice.\nHypoglycemia —An abnormal decrease in blood\nsugar level.\nJejunum —Section of the small intestine.\nLaparoscope —A pencil-thin telescope that allows\nsurgery to be done through half-inch incisions.\nPylorus —The opening from the stomach to the\nintestine.\nVagus nerve —Cranial nerves that supply the inter-\nnal organs (viscera).\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome —A syndrome marked\nby peptic ulcers and gastrinomas in the pancreas.inflammation may spread through the entire large intes-\ntine, but only rarely affects the very last section of thesmall intestine (ileum). The rest of the small intestineremains normal.\nUlcerative colitis differs from Crohn’s disease ,\nwhich is a form of IBD that affects both the small andlarge intestines. The inflammation of ulcerative colitisoccurs only in the lining of the intestine (unlike Crohn’sdisease which affects all of the layers of the intestinalwall). As the inflammation continues, the tissue of theintestine begins to slough off, leaving pits (ulcerations)which often become infected.\nLike Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis occurs in all\nage groups, with the most common age of diagnosisbeing 15–35 years of age. Men and women are affectedequally. Whites are more frequently affected than otherracial groups, and people of Jewish origin have 3–6 timesgreater likelihood of suffering from any IBD. IBD isfamilial; an IBD patient has a 20% chance of havingother relatives who are fellow sufferers.\nCauses and symptoms\nNo specific cause of ulcerative colitis has been iden-\ntified. Although no organism (virus, bacteria, or fungi)has been found to set off the cycle of inflammation thatoccurs in ulcerative colitis, some researchers continue tosuspect that some such organism is responsible for initi-ating the cycle. Other researchers are concentrating onidentifying some change in the cells of the colon thatwould make the body’s immune system accidentallybegin treating those cells as foreign invaders. Other evi-dence for such a disorder of the immune system includesthe high number of other immune disorders that tend toaccompany ulcerative colitis.\nThe first symptoms of ulcerative colitis are abdomi-\nnal cramping and pain , a sensation of urgent need to\nhave a bowel movement (defecate), and blood and pus inthe stools. Some patients experience diarrhea ,fever ,\nand weight loss. If the diarrhea continues, signs of severefluid loss ( dehydration ) begin to appear, including low\nblood pressure, fast heart rate, and dizziness .\nSevere complications of ulcerative colitis include\nperforation of the intestine (in which the wall of theintestine develops a hole), toxic dilation of the colon (inwhich the colon become quite large in diameter), and thedevelopment of colon cancer .\nIntestinal perforation occurs when long-standing\ninflammation and ulceration of the intestine weakens thewall to such a degree that a hole occurs. This is a life-threatening complication, because the contents of theintestine (which under normal conditions contains a large\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3429Ulcerative colitisnumber of bacteria) spill into the abdomen. The presence\nof bacteria in the abdomen can result in a massive infec-tion called peritonitis .\nToxic dilation of the colon is thought to occur\nbecause the intestinal inflammation interferes with thenormal function of the muscles of the intestine. Thisallows the intestine to become lax, and its diameter beginsto increase. The enlarged diameter thins the walls further,increasing the risk of perforation and peritonitis. Whenthe diameter of the intestine is quite large, and infection ispresent, the condition is referred to as “toxic megacolon.”\nPatients with ulcerative colitis have a significant risk\nof developing colon cancer . This risk seems to begin\naround 10 years after diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Therisk becomes statistically greater every year:\n• At 10 years, the risk of cancer is about 0.5–1%.\n• At 15 years, the risk of cancer is about 12%.\n• At 20 years, the risk of cancer is about 23%.• At 24 years, the risk of cancer is about 42%.\nThe overall risk of developing cancer seems to be\ngreatest for those patients with the largest extent of intes-tine involved in ulcerative colitis.\nPatients with ulcerative colitis also have a high\nchance of experiencing other disorders, including inflam-mation of the joints (arthritis), inflammation of the verte-brae (spondylitis), ulcers in the mouth and on the skin,the development of painful, red bumps on the skin,inflammation of several areas of the eye, and various dis-orders of the liver and gallbladder.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is first suspected based on the symptoms\nthat a patient is experiencing. Examination of the stoolwill usually reveal the presence of blood and pus (white\nblood cells). Blood tests may show an increase in thenumber of white blood cells, which is an indication ofinflammation occurring somewhere in the body. Theblood test may also reveal anemia, particularly when agreat deal of blood has been lost in the stool.\nThe most important method of diagnosis is\nendoscopy, during which a doctor passes a flexible tubewith a tiny, fiberoptic camera device through the rectumand into the colon. The doctor can then examine the liningof the intestine for signs of inflammation and ulcerationthat might indicate ulcerative colitis. A tiny sample (biop-sy) of the intestine will be removed through the endo-scope, which will be examined under a microscope forevidence of ulcerative colitis. Because of the increasedrisk of cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis, endo-scopic exam will need to be repeated frequently. Biopsiesshould be taken regularly, to closely monitor the intestinefor the development of cancer or precancerous changes. \nX-ray examination is helpful to determine the\namount of intestine affected by the disease. However, x-ray examinations requiring the use of barium should bedelayed until treatment has begun. Barium is a chalkysolution that the patient drinks or is administered throughthe rectum and into the intestine (enema). The presenceof barium in the intestine allows more detail to be seenon x-ray pictures. However, because of the risk of intesti-nal perforation in ulcerative colitis, most doctors begintreatment before stressing the wall of the intestine withthe barium solution.\nTreatment\nTreatment for ulcerative colitis addresses the under-\nlying inflammation, as well as the problems occurringdue to continued diarrhea and blood loss.\nInflammation is treated with a drug called sul-\nfasalazine, Sulfasalazine is made up of two parts. Onepart is related to the sulfa antibiotics ; the other part is a\nform of the anti-inflammatory chemical salicylic acid(related to aspirin ). Sulfasalazine is not well-absorbed\nfrom the intestine, so it stays mostly within the intestine,where it is broken down into its components. It is believedto be primarily the salicylic acid component that is activein treating ulcerative colitis, by fighting inflammation.For patients who do not respond to sulfasalazine, steroidmedications (such as prednisone) are the next choice.\nDepending on the degree of blood loss, a patient\nwith ulcerative colitis may require blood transfusionsand fluid replacement through a needle in the vein (intra-venous or IV). Medications that can slow diarrhea mustbe used with great care, because they may actually causethe development of toxic megacolon.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3430Ulcerative colitis\nA specimen of a colon indicating ulcerative colitis. (Photo\nResearchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)A patient with toxic megacolon requires close moni-\ntoring and care in the hospital. He or she will usually begiven steroid medications through an IV , and may be puton antibiotics. If these measures do not improve the situ-ation, the patient will have to undergo surgery to removethe colon. This is done because the risk of death after\nperforation of toxic megacolon is greater than 50%.\nSimilarly, a patient with proven cancer of the colon,\nor even a patient who shows certain signs thought to indi-cate a precancerous condition, will need his or her colonremoved. Removal of the colon is called a colectomy.When a colectomy is performed, a piece of the smallintestine (ileum) is pulled through an opening in theabdomen. This bit of intestine is fashioned surgically toallow a special bag to be placed over it, in order to catchthe body’s waste (feces) which no longer can be passedthrough the large intestine and out of the anus. Thisopening, which will remain for the duration of thepatient’s life, is called an ileostomy.\nPrognosis\nRemission refers to a disease becoming inactive for\na period of time. The rate of remission of ulcerative coli-tis (after a first attack) is nearly 90%. Those individualswhose colitis is confined primarily to the left side of thelarge intestine have the best prognosis. Those individualswith extensive colitis, involving most or all of the largeintestine, have a much poorer prognosis. Recent studiesshow that about 10% of these patients will have died by10 years after diagnosis. About 20–25% of all ulcerativecolitis patients will require colectomy. Unlike the casefor patients with Crohn’s disease, however, such radicalsurgery results in a cure of the disease.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGlickman, Robert. “Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Ulcerative\nColitis and Crohn’s Disease.” In Harrison’s Principles of\nInternal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Ulcers (digestive)",
    "content": "Ulcers (digestive)\nDefinition\nIn general, an ulcer is any eroded area of skin or a\nmucous membrane, marked by tissue disintegration. Incommon usage, however, ulcer is usually used to refer todisorders in the upper digestive tract. The terms ulcer,gastric ulcer, and peptic ulcer are often used loosely andinterchangeably. Peptic ulcers can develop in the lowerpart of the esophagus, the stomach, the first part of thesmall intestine (the duodenum), and the second part ofthe small intestine (the jejunum).\nDescription\nIt is estimated that 2% of the adult population in the\nUnited States has active peptic ulcers, and that about\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3431Ulcers (digestive)10% will develop ulcers at some point in their lives.\nThere are about 500,000 new cases of peptic ulcer in theUnited States every year, with as many as 4 millionrecurrences. The male/female ratio for ulcers of thedigestive tract is 3:1.\nThe most common forms of peptic ulcer are duodenal\nand gastric. About 80% of all ulcers in the digestive tractare duodenal ulcers. This type of ulcer may strike peoplein any age group but is most common in males betweenthe ages of 20 and 45. The incidence of duodenal ulcershas dropped over the past 30 years. Gastric ulcers accountfor about 16% of peptic ulcers. They are most common inmales between the ages of 55 and 70. The single mostcommon cause of gastric ulcers is the use of nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs , or NSAIDs. The widespread\nuse of NSAIDs is thought to explain why the incidence ofgastric ulcers in the United States is rising.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses of peptic ulcers\nThere are three major causes of peptic ulcers: infec-\ntion, certain types of medication, and disorders that causeoversecretion of stomach juices.\nHELICOBACTER PYLORI INFECTION. Helicobacter\npylori is a rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium that lives\nin the mucous tissues that line the digestive tract. Infec-tion with H. pylori is the most common cause of duode-\nnal ulcers. About 95% of patients with duodenal ulcersare infected with H. pylori , as opposed to only 70% of\npatients with gastric ulcers.\nUSE OF NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY\nDRUGS (NSAIDS). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nor NSAIDs, are painkillers that many people use forheadaches, sore muscles, arthritis, menstrual cramps, andsimilar complaints. Many NSAIDs are available withoutprescriptions. Common NSAIDs include aspirin ,\nibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), flurbiprofen (Ansaid,Ocufen), ketoprofen (Orudis), and indomethacin(Indacin). Chronic NSAID users have 40 times the riskof developing a gastric ulcer as nonusers. Users are alsothree times more likely than nonusers to develop bleed-ing or fatal complications of ulcers. Aspirin is theNSAID that is most likely to cause ulcers.\nMISCELLANEOUS SYNDROMES AND DISORDERS.\nFewer than 5% of peptic ulcers are due to these disorders.They include Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a disorder inwhich small tumors, called gastrinomas, secrete a hor-mone (gastrin) that stimulates the production of digestivejuices. Because of this excess secretion, these disordersare sometimes called hypersecretory syndromes.OTHER RISK FACTORS. Smoking is an important risk\nfactor that increases a patient’s chance of developing anulcer, decreases the body’s response to therapy, andincreases the chances of dying from ulcer complications.Blood type appears to be a predisposing factor for ulcerlocation; people with type A blood are more likely to havegastric ulcers, while those with type O are more likely todevelop duodenal ulcers. The role of emotional stress in\nulcer development is currently debated. Present researchindicates that an individual’s attitudes toward stress, ratherthan the amount of stress by itself, is a better predictor ofvulnerability to peptic ulcers. Preferences for high-fat orspicy foods do not appear to be significant risk factors.\nSymptoms\nGASTRIC ULCERS. The symptoms of gastric ulcers\ninclude feelings of indigestion and heartburn , weight\nloss, and repeated episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding.Ulcer pain is often described as gnawing, dull, aching, or\nresembling hunger pangs. The patient may be nauseatedand suffer loss of appetite. About 30% of patients withgastric ulcers are awakened by pain at night. Manypatients have periods of chronic ulcer pain alternatingwith symptom-free periods that last for several weeks ormonths. This characteristic is called periodicity.\nDUODENAL ULCERS. The symptoms of duodenal\nulcers include heartburn, stomach pain relieved by eatingor antacids , weight gain, and a burning sensation at the\nback of the throat. The patient is most likely to feel dis-comfort two to four hours after meals, or after having cit-rus juice, coffee, or aspirin. About 50% of patients withduodenal ulcers awake during the night with pain, usual-ly between midnight and 3 \nA.M. A regular pattern of ulcer\npain associated with certain periods of day or night or atime interval after meals is called rhythmicity.\nNot all digestive ulcers produce symptoms; as many\nas 20% of ulcer patients have so-called painless or silentulcers. Silent ulcers occur most frequently in the elderlyand in chronic NSAID users.\nComplications\nBetween 10–20% of peptic ulcer patients develop\ncomplications at some time during the course of their ill-ness. All of these are potentially serious conditions.Complications are not always preceded by diagnosis ofor treatment for ulcers; as many as 60% of patients withcomplications have not had prior symptoms.\nHEMORRHAGE. Bleeding is the most common com-\nplication of ulcers. It may result in anemia, vomiting blood(hematemesis), or the passage of bright red blood throughthe rectum (melena). About half of all cases of bleeding\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3432Ulcers (digestive)from the upper digestive tract are caused by ulcers. The\nmortality rate from ulcer hemorrhage is 6–10%.\nPERFORATION. About 5% of ulcer patients develop\nperforations, which are holes in the duodenal or gastricwall through which the stomach contents can leak outinto the abdominal cavity. The incidence of perforation isrising because of the increased use of NSAIDs, particu-larly among the elderly. The signs of an ulcer perforationare severe pain, fever , and tenderness when the doctor\ntouches the abdomen. Most cases of perforation requireemergency surgery. The mortality rate is about 5%.\nPENETRATION. Ulcer penetration is a complication\nin which the ulcer erodes through the intestinal wallwithout digestive fluid leaking into the abdomen.Instead, the ulcer penetrates into an adjoining organ,such as the pancreas or liver. The signs of penetration aremore severe pain without rhythmicity or periodicity, and\nthe spread of the pain to the lower back.\nOBSTRUCTION. Obstruction of the stomach outlet\noccurs in about 2% of ulcer patients. It is caused byswelling or scar tissue formation that narrows the openingbetween the stomach and the duodenum (the pylorus).Over 90% of patients with obstruction have recurrentvomiting of partly digested or undigested food; 20% areseriously dehydrated. These patients also usually feel fullafter eating only a little food, and may lose weight.\nDiagnosis\nPhysical examination and patient history\nThe diagnosis of peptic ulcers is rarely made on the\nbasis of a physical examination alone. The only signifi-\ncant finding may be mild soreness in the area over thestomach when the doctor presses (palpates) it. The doctoris more likely to suspect an ulcer if the patient has one ormore of the following risk factors:\n• male sex • age over 45 • recent weight loss, bleeding, recurrent vomiting, jaun-\ndice, back pain, or anemia \n• history of using aspirin or other NSAIDs \n• history of heavy smoking \n• family history of ulcers or stomach cancer\nEndoscopy and imaging studies\nAn endoscopy is considered the best procedure for\ndiagnosing digestive ulcers and for taking samples ofstomach tissue for biopsies. An endoscope is a slendertube-shaped instrument that allows the doctor to view thetissues lining the stomach and duodenum. Duodenal\nulcers are rarely malignant. If the ulcer is in the stomach,however, the doctor will take a tissue sample because3–5% of gastric ulcers are malignant. Radiological stud-ies are sometimes used instead of endoscopy becausethey are less expensive, more comfortable for the patient,and are 85% accurate in detecting malignancies.\nLaboratory tests\nBLOOD TESTS. Blood tests usually give normal\nresults in ulcer patients without complications. They areuseful, however, in evaluating anemia from a bleedingulcer or a high white cell count from perforation or pene-tration. Serum gastrin levels can be used to screen forZollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nTESTS FOR HELICOBACTER PYLORI .It is important to\ntest for H. pylori because almost all ulcer patients who are\nnot taking NSAIDs are infected. Noninvasive testsinclude blood tests for immune response and a breath test.In the breath test, the patient is given an oral dose of radi-olabeled urea. If H. pylori is present, it will react with the\nurea and the patient will exhale radiolabeled carbon diox-ide. Invasive tests for H. pylori include tissue biopsies and\ncultures performed from fluid obtained by endoscopy.\nTreatment\nMedications\nMost drugs that are currently given to treat ulcers\nwork either by lowering the rate of stomach acid secre-tion or by protecting the mucous tissues that line thedigestive tract.\nANTISECRETORY DRUGS. Medications that lower the\nrate of stomach acid secretions fall into two major cate-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3433Ulcers (digestive)\nA clinical photograph of a large duodenal ulcer after surgi-\ncal removal.The ulcer is the prominent triangular crater atcenter. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)gories: proton pump inhibitors, which bind an enzyme that\nsecretes stomach acid, and H 2receptor antagonists, which\nwork by reducing intracellular acid secretion. The protonpump inhibitors include omeprazole (Prilosec) and lanso-prazole (Prevacid). The H\n2receptor antagonists include\nranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pep-cid), and nizatidine (Axid). Both types of drugs have fewserious side effects and appear to be safe for long-term use.\nPROTECTIVE DRUGS. The drugs that are currently\nused to protect the stomach tissues are sucralfate(Carafate), which forms a pastelike substance that clingsto the mucous tissues and prevents further damage fromstomach acid; and bismuth preparations. A third type ofprotective drug includes misoprostol (Cytotec), which isoften given to patients with ulcers caused by NSAIDs.\nSurgery\nSurgical treatment of ulcers is generally used only\nfor complications and suspected malignancies. The mostcommon surgical procedures that are used are vago-tomies, in which the connections of the vagus nerve tothe stomach are cut in order to reduce acid secretion; andantrectomies, which involve the removal of a part of thestomach (the antrum).\nEradication of Helicobacter pylori\nMost doctors presently recommend treatment to\neliminate H. pylori in order to prevent ulcer recurrences.\nWithout such treatment, ulcers recur at the rate of 80%per year. The usual regimen used to eliminate the bacteri-um is a combination of tetracycline, bismuth subsalicy-late (Pepto-Bismol), and metronidazole (Metizol).\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments can relieve symptoms and\npromote healing of ulcers. A primary goal of thesetreatments is to rebalance the stomach’s hydrochloric\nacid output and to enhance the mucosal lining of thestomach.\nFood allergies have been pointed to as a major\ncause of peptic (stomach) ulcers. An elimination/chal-lenge diet can help identify the allergenic food(s) andcontinued elimination of these foods can assist in heal-ing the ulcer. People with ulcers should not takeaspirin. They should also stop smoking, since smokingirritates the mucosal lining of the stomach. Antacidsshould be avoided by anyone with an ulcer, becausethey can cause a rebound effect of increasing gastricacid secretion, as well as deplete vital nutrients neces-sary for healing. Stress reduction is also important for\nulcer sufferers.\nBotanical medicine offers a variety of remedies\nthat may be helpful in ulcer treatment. Deglycyrrhiz-inated licorice or DGL, in a chewable or powder form,can help heal the mucous membranes and increasemucous so that it mixes with saliva to protect the mem-branes. Raw cabbage juice, high in glutanic acid, isvery effective in healing an ulcer (take 1 quart per dayin divided doses). Soothing herbs, such as plantain(Plantago major ), marsh mallow ( Althaea officinalis ),\nand slippery elm ( Ulmus fulva ); astringent herbs, such\nas geranium ( Pelargonium odoratissimum ); and the\nanitmicrobial herb goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis )\ncan all be effective. Nutritionists advise taking antioxi-dant nutrients, including vitamins A, C, and E, zinc,\nand selenium.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from ulcers is good for\nmost patients. Very few ulcers fail to respond to themedications that are currently used to treat them.Recurrences can be cut to 5% by eradication of H.\npylori . Most patients who develop complications recov-\ner without problems even when emergency surgery isnecessary.\nPrevention\nStrategies for the prevention of ulcers or their recur-\nrence include the following:\n• eradication of H. pylori in patients already diagnosed\nwith ulcers \n• giving misoprostol to patients who must take NSAIDs • avoiding unnecessary use of aspirin and NSAIDs • giving up smoking • cutting down on alcohol, tea, coffee, and sodas contain-\ning caffeine\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3434Ulcers (digestive)\nA barium x-ray image of a gastric ulcer.

It can be used alone or in\ncombination with other medications applied directly tothe skin or taken internally. \nPurpose\nUltraviolet (UV) light treatment is used primarily in\ncases of severe psoriasis that have not responded to othermedications or in cases affecting large portions of thebody. Patients will typically receive a series of 3–5 week-ly treatments for a month or more to bring their psoriasissymptoms into check. They may also receive periodicmaintenance treatments to prevent recurrence of theirpsoriasis. Other skin conditions treated with UV lighttreatments are vitiligo , a condition in which people lose\npigmentation in large patches of their skin, and atopic\ndermatitis , an allergy-related skin condition that pro-\nduces itchy, reddish, and scaly patches of skin.\nPrecautions\nExposure to UV radiation is known to prematurely\nage the skin over time and increase the risk of skin can-\ncer. These potential effects should be weighed against the\npotential benefits of the treatment. A history will be takenregarding sun exposure and burning, medications, such asdiuretics , that may increase UV sensitivity exposure, and\nany history of skin cancers. Sometimes, UV light treat-ments are given in combination with photosensitizingagents, which maximize UV’s effects on the skin. Patientswho receive these agents, called psoralens, must take careto avoid exposure to sunlight, which also contains UVradiation. Exposure to UV radiation can also causecataracts and other eye damage, so the patient’s eyes\nmust be adequately shielded during the treatments. \nDescription\nUV light treatment can employ one of two bands of\nthe ultraviolet spectrum: ultraviolet A (UV A), and ultra-violet B (UVB). Patients receive full body treatments inspecial light boxes; smaller areas of the skin are some-times treated with hand-held devices.\nUVB treatment\nPsoriasis is the most common skin disease treated\nwith UVB light treatment. Its mechanism of actionremains unclear, but investigators speculate it may killabnormal skin cells or alter immune system reactions inthe skin. Most patients require 18–30 treatments beforesubstantial improvement or complete clearing is seen.The intensity of the UV applied will vary depending onthe patient’s skin type. Fair-skinned patients will startwith a relatively weaker dose; dark-skinned patients, a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3435Ultraviolet light treatmentstronger dose. Physicians will first expose a small area of\nskin to UVB to determine the minimum erythema dose(MED), the minimum amount of UVB that produces red-ness 24 hours after exposure. Patients will be exposed forshort times early in the treatment cycle, but these timeswill gradually increase over time. \nThe Goeckerman regimen, a treatment that com-\nbines UVB light with coal tar applied to the skin, isamong the oldest and most frequently used treatments forpatients with moderate to severe psoriasis. The coal tar isa photosensitizing agent, and, when it interacts withUVB, it appears to limit the abnormal turnover of skincells characteristic of psoriasis. Although treatments withUVB and coal tar are highly effective, many patients dis-like the smell. Some investigators believe use of petrole-um jelly or other emollients are just as effective as thecoaltar preparations.\nIn addition to their UVB treatments, many patients\nwill receive systemic agents such as methotrexate, a drugused in severe case of psoriasis, and certain vitamin Aderivatives called retinoids. \nPUV A treatment\nPsoralens are photosensitizing agents found in\nplants. They have been known since ancient Egypt buthave only been available in a chemically synthesizedform since the 1970s. Psoralens are taken systemically orcan be applied directly to the skin. The psoralens allow arelatively lower dose of UV A to be used. When they arecombined with exposure to UV A in PUV A, they arehighly effective at clearing psoriasis. Like UVB lighttreatments, the reason remains unclear, though investiga-tors speculate there may be similar effects on cellturnover and the skin’s immune response.\nChoosing the proper dose for PUV A is similar to the\nprocedure followed with UVB. The physician can choose adose based on the patient’s skin type. Often, however, asmall area of the patient’s skin will be exposed to UV Aafter ingestion of psoralen. The dose of UV A that producesuniform redness 72 hours later, called the minimum photo-toxic dose (MPD), becomes the starting dose for treatment.\nSome patients experience nausea and itching after\ningesting the psoralen compound. For these patients“bath PUV A” may be a good option.\nPreparation\nNo major preparation is required for UV light treat-\nments. Areas of the skin that are especially sensitive tothe effects of UV light, such as the groin, backside, orface, are shielded during the treatments. Areas not affect-ed by psoriasis are also covered. Special goggles areworn to protect the eyes. Some physicians apply an\nemollient, such as petroleum jelly, to the skin or othertopical agents, such as coal tar, to enhance the results. InPUV A treatments, the psoralen is usually taken one hourbefore the treatment.\nAftercare\nNo major aftercare is required following UV light\ntreatments. Patients, however, must take great care tolimit or eliminate other exposures to UV radiation, suchas from sunlight or tanning beds, because of theincreased risk of premature aging of the skin and the\ndevelopment of skin cancers. Patients should monitortheir skin closely for any signs of precancerous or can-cerous skin growths in the future.\nRisks\nPeople who receive UV light treatments are at high-\ner risk of premature aging of the skin, and of developingskin cancer. These risks should be balanced against thebenefits of treatment. Patients must also take care to limitor eliminate their exposure to other sources of UV radia-tion, especially if they are taking a psoralen compound inaddition to receiving the UV treatments. \nNormal results\nPsoriasis will normally show significant improvement\nto complete healing with three to five UVB treatments aweek for about four to five weeks. PUV A treatments mayrequire a bit longer to take effect, but because the overalldosage of UV is lower, they are thought by some investi-gators to be a safer alternative to UVB treatments.\nAbnormal results\nModern light boxes carefully control the dosage of\nUV radiation and the exposure time. Overdose or overex-posure is possible, however, and can lead to severeburns . It is important to choose a treatment provider who\nis experienced in the technique. It is also important to tellthe physician about all medications being taken by thepatient. Some medications, either alone or in combina-tion with a psoralen, can provoke an extreme reaction toUV radiation.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDover, Jeffrey S. “Phototherapy.” In Manual of Clinical Prob-\nlems in Dermatology , ed.

Two bands of the UV spec-trum, UVA and UVB, are used to treat psoriasisand other skin diseases.Description\nIn the fetus, the testes are in the abdomen. As devel-\nopment progresses they migrate downward through thegroin and into the scrotum. This event takes place late infetal development, during the eighth month of gestation.Thirty percent of premature boys have testes that havenot yet made the full descent. Only 3–4% of full-termbaby boys have undescended testes, and half of thosecomplete the journey by the age of three months. Eightypercent of all undescended testes cases naturally correctthemselves during the first year of life. Undescendedtestes that are not corrected can lead to sterility and anincreased risk of testicular cancer .\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of undescended testes is presently\nunknown, however its symptoms are quite apparent. Oneor all of the testicles can be undescended, therefore thetesticles appear to be either missing or lopsided. \nDiagnosis\nThe newborn examination always checks for testes in\nthe scrotum. It they are not found, a search will be con-ducted, but not necessarily right away. In most cases, thetestes will drop into place later. If the testes are present atall, they can be anywhere within a couple inches of theappropriate spot. In 5% of cases, one testis is completelyabsent. In 10%, the condition occurs on both sides. Pres-ence of undescended testes is indicated by measuring theamount of gonadotropin hormone in the blood.\nTreatment\nOnce it is determined that the testes will not natural-\nly descend, surgery becomes necessary. The procedure iscalled an orchiopexy and is relatively simple once thetestes are located. The surgery is usually performed whenthe boy is between one to two years old. \nPrognosis\nUndescended testes must be treated to eliminate the\nincreased risk of testicular cancer and the possibility of\nsterility. Undescended testes are twice as likely to devel-op cancer. Ten percent of all testicular cancers are inundescended testes.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds.

It is used to help diagnose disor-\nders and diseases of, or related to, the upper gastrointestinaltract, including cases of hiatal hernia , diverticuli, ulcers,\ntumors, obstruction, enteritis, gastroesophageal reflux dis-ease, Crohn’s disease , and pulmonary aspiration.\nPrecautions\nBecause of the risks of radiation exposure to the\nfetus, pregnant women are advised to avoid this proce-dure.

A radiologist typically is in attendance tooversee the procedure, and view and interpret the fluoro-scopic pictures. Before the test begins, the patient issometimes administered an injection of glucagon, a med-ication which slows stomach and bowel activity, to allowthe radiologist to get a clearer picture of the gastrointesti-nal tract. In order to further improve the clarity of theupper GI pictures, the patient may be given a cup of bak-ing soda crystals to swallow, which distend the stomachby producing gas.\nOnce these preparatory steps are complete, the\npatient stands against an upright x-ray table, and a fluo-roscopic screen is placed in front of him. The patient willbe asked to drink from a cup of flavored barium sulfate, athick and chalky-tasting liquid that allows the radiologistto see the digestive tract, while the radiologist views theesophagus, stomach, and duodenum on the fluoroscopicscreen. The patient will be asked to change positions fre-quently in order to coat the entire surface of the gastroin-testinal tract with barium. The technician or radiologistmay press on the patient’s abdomen in order to spread thebarium. The x-ray table will also be moved several timesthroughout the procedure. The radiologist will ask thepatient to hold his breath periodically while exposuresare being taken. The entire procedure takes approximate-ly 30 minutes.\nIn some cases, in addition to the standard upper GI\nseries, a doctor may request a detailed intestine, or smallbowel, radiography and fluoroscopy series; it is alsocalled a small bowel follow-through (SBFT). Once thepreliminary upper GI series is complete, the patient willbe escorted to a waiting area while the barium travelsdown through the rest of the small intestinal path. Every15–30 minutes, the patient will return to the x-ray suitefor additional x rays, or films. Once the barium has com-pleted its trip down the small bowel tract, the test is com-pleted. This procedure can take anywhere from one tofour hours.\nEsophageal radiography, also called a barium\nesophagram or a barium swallow, is a study of the esoph-agus only, and is usually performed as part of the upper\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3438Upper GI-examGI series. It is commonly used to diagnose the cause of\ndifficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) and for detectinghiatal hernia. A barium sulfate liquid, and sometimespieces of food covered in barium, are given to the patientto drink and eat while a radiologist examines the swal-lowing mechanism on a fluoroscopic screen. The testtakes approximately 30 minutes.\nPreparation\nPatients must not eat, drink, or smoke for eight hours\nprior to undergoing an upper GI examination. Longerdietary restrictions may be required, depending on thetype and diagnostic purpose of the test. Patients undergo-ing a small bowel follow-through exam may be asked totake laxatives the day prior to the test. Upper GI patients\nare typically required to wear a hospital gown, or similarattire, and to remove all jewelry, so the camera has anunobstructed view of the abdomen. \nAftercare\nNo special aftercare treatment or regimen is required\nfor an upper GI series. The patient may eat and drink assoon as the test is completed. The barium sulfate maymake the patient’s stool white for several days, andpatients are encouraged to drink plenty of fluids in orderto eliminate it from their system.\nRisks\nBecause the upper GI series is an x-ray procedure, it\ndoes involve minor exposure to ionizing radiation.Unless the patient is pregnant, or multiple radiological orfluoroscopic studies are required, the small dose of radia-tion incurred during a single procedure poses little risk.However, multiple studies requiring fluoroscopic expo-sure that are conducted in a short time period have beenknown, on rare occasions, to cause skin death (necrosis)\nin some individuals. This risk can be minimized by care-ful monitoring and documentation of cumulative radia-tion doses administered to these patients.\nNormal results\nA normal upper GI series will show a healthy, func-\ntioning, and unobstructed digestive tract.\nAbnormal results\nObstructions or inflammation, including ulcers of the\nesophagus, stomach, or small intestine; or irregularities inthe swallowing mechanism are just a few of the possibleabnormalities that may show up on an upper GI series.

Insertion is most often donethrough the skin (percutaneously); however, in the pres-ence of kidney or ureteral stones, stenting is ideally doneduring cystoscopy .\nPurpose\nUreteral stenting may be placed on a long-term basis\n(months to years) in order to bypass ureteral obstruction.Short-term stenting (weeks to months) may be used as anadjunct to open surgical procedures of the urinary tract toprovide a mold around which healing can occur, or todivert the urinary flow away from areas of leakage. Fol-lowing balloon dilation or incision of ureteral strictures,placement of stents maintains the functionality of theureters. Stents may also be used in the presence of kid-\nney stones to manipulate or prevent stone migration\nprior to treatment, or to make the ureters more easilyidentifiable during difficult surgical procedures. Ureteralstents may be used in those with active kidney infectionor with markedly diseased, intolerant bladders (e.g.,damage from radiation therapy , bladder invasion by\nadjacent neoplasm).\nPreparation\nThe procedure should be thoroughly explained by a\nmedical professional before it takes place.

    "title": "Urethritis",
    "content": "Urethritis\nDefinition\nUrethritis is an inflammation of the urethra that is\nusually caused by an infection.\nDescription\nThe urethra is the canal that moves urine from the\nbladder to the outside of the body. When this canalbecomes infected, inflammation occurs due to the accu-mulation of white blood cells in the area. When thisoccurs, it is called urethritis. Besides the urethra, the uri-nary tract consists of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys.Inflammation can move up the urethra, causing cystitis in\nthe bladder, or nephritis in the kidneys. Collectively, these\ninflammations are called urinary tract infections or UTIs. \nUrinary tract infections are much more common in\nwomen than in men, probably due to anatomy. Infectionsare especially more common in older women, due tobladder problems.\nCauses and symptoms\nUncomplicated urethritis usually results from infec-\ntion by the bacteria Escherichia coli , commonly found\nin the bowel. Complicated urethritis can occur whenother problems exist, such as kidney stones , malforma-\ntions of the urinary tract, spinal cord injury , or a com-\npromised immune system. People with diabetes tend tohave more urinary tract infections, as well as hospitalizedpatients. Urinary tract infections can also be sexuallytransmitted. Some people seem to be susceptible to uri-nary tract infections, having them recurrently.\nFrequently, a urinary tract infection has no symp-\ntoms. Common symptoms though, include pain and a\nburning sensation when urinating, frequent urination, orpassing blood in the urine. Signs that the infection maybe worsening include fever and chills, nausea, vomiting,\nand lower back pain.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis for a urinary tract infection is made by\nassessing the symptoms, feeling (palpating) the abdomen\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3440Urethritisfor tenderness, and a urinalysis . A urinalysis, or urine\nsample, is examined for both the presence of bacteria andwhite blood cells. After this, a urine culture to determine\nwhat bacteria is causing the infection may be done.\nTreatment\nTypical treatment for urinary tract infections is a\ncourse of antibiotics . In women who have recurrent ure-\nthritis, the diagnosis and treatment is often resolved overthe phone. Additional drugs are sometimes given torelieve discomfort.\nAlternative treatment\nFor those individuals who seem to be more suscepti-\nble to urinary tract infections, drinking lots of fluids at thefirst sign of an infection can ward it off by diluting thebacteria present and flushing the system. Adding a tea-spoon of baking soda to a glass of water and drinking itcan change the pH of the urine, causing it to burn less.Also, cranberry juice contains a compound that can pre-vent bacteria from sticking to and thus growing in the uri-nary tract. Antimicrobial herbs, such as uva ursi ( Arc-\ntostaphylos uva-ursi ) and pipsissewa ( Chimaphila umbel-\nlata), may be helpful. Other herbs, such as marsh mallow\n(Althaea officinalis ), slippery elm ( Ulmus fulva ), comfrey\n(Symphytum officinale ), plantain ( Plantago major ), and\ncornsilk, can soothe the urinary tract. Lactobacillus aci-\ndophilus and L. bifidus supplementation reintroduces nor-\nmal flora into the urinary tract. Acupuncture and home-\nopathy can also be effective therapies for urethritis.\nPrognosis\nGiven the appropriate antibiotic, urinary tract infec-\ntions usually go away quickly. If not treated soon enough,however, urethritis can move up the urinary tract, infect-ing the bladder and possibly the kidneys, resulting in kid-ney damage. If the infection moves into the blood, addi-tional complications can arise. Those who have previous-ly had a urinary tract infection are more susceptible toadditional urinary tract infections. Because of this,patients need to be aware of the symptoms so that a physi-cian can be notified if the infection becomes recurrent.\nPrevention\nThere are some steps that can be taken to keep the\nurinary tract healthy and prevent infection.\n• drink plenty of fluids;• do not hold urine once the urge to urinate has occurred; • after a bowel movement, wipe from front to rear to\nkeep bowel bacteria at a distance;• wear cotton underwear\n• rinse soap off well in the shower• urinate after sexual intercourse• for post-menopausal women, estrogen replacement\ntherapy can help prevent urinary tract infection\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

    "content": "Uric acid tests\nDefinition\nUric acid tests are tests that are done to measure the\nlevels of uric acid in blood serum or in urine.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3441Uric acid tests\nA false color transmission electron micrograph (TEM) scan\nof non-specific urethritis. (Photograph by Dr. R. Dourmashkin,\nCustom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)Purpose\nThe uric acid tests are used to evaluate the blood lev-\nels of uric acid for gout and to assess uric acid levels in\nthe urine for kidney stone formation. The urine test isused most often to monitor patients already diagnosedwith kidney stones , but it can also be used to detect dis-\norders that affect the body’s production of uric acid andto help measure the level of kidney functioning.\nUric acid is a waste product that results from the\nbreakdown of purine, a nucleic acid. (Nucleic acids arethe building blocks of DNA.) Uric acid is made in theliver and excreted by the kidneys. If the liver producestoo much uric acid or the kidneys excrete too little, thepatient will have too much uric acid in the blood. Thiscondition is called hyperuricemia. Supersaturated uricacid in the urine (uricosuria) can crystallize to form kid-ney stones that may block the tubes that lead from thekidneys to the bladder (the ureters).\nPrecautions\nBlood test\nPatients scheduled for a blood test for uric acid\nshould be checked for the following medications: loopdiuretics (Diamox, Bumex, Edecrin, or Lasix); ethambu-\ntol (Myambutol); vincristine (Oncovin); pyrazinamide(Tebrazid); thiazide diuretics (Naturetin, Hydrex, Diuril,Esidrix, HydroDiuril, Aquatensen, Renese, Diurese);aspirin (low doses); acetaminophen (Tylenol); ascorbic\nacid (vitamin C preparations); levodopa (Larodopa); orphenacetin. These drugs can affect test results.\nCertain foods that are high in purine may increase the\npatient’s levels of uric acid. These include kidneys, liver,sweetbreads, sardines, anchovies, and meat extracts.\nUrine test\nPatients should be checked for the following med-\nications before the urine test: diuretics, aspirin, pyrazi-namide (Tebrazid), phenylbutazone, probenecid (Bene-mid), and allopurinol (Lopurin). If the patient needs tocontinue taking these medications, the laboratory shouldbe notified.\nThe laboratory should also be notified if the patient\nhas had recent x-ray tests requiring contrast dyes. Thesechemicals increase uric acid levels in urine and decreasethem in blood.\nDescription\nThe uric acid blood test is performed on a sample of\nthe patient’s blood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuumtube. The procedure, which is called a venipuncture,\ntakes about five minutes. The urine test requires thepatient to collect all urine voided over a 24-hour period,with the exception of the very first specimen. The patientkeeps the specimen container on ice or in the refrigeratorduring the collection period.\nPreparation\nThe uric acid test requires either a blood or urine\nsample. For the blood sample, the patient should be fast-\ning(nothing to eat or drink) for at least eight hours\nbefore the test. The urine test for uric acid requires a 24-hour urine collection. The urine test does notrequire the\npatient to fast or cut down on fluids. Some laboratoriesencourage patients to drink plenty of fluids during thecollection period.\nRisks\nRisks for the blood test are minimal, but may\ninclude slight bleeding from the puncture site, a smallbruise or swelling in the area, or fainting or feeling light-\nheaded.\nNormal results\nBlood test\nReference values for blood uric acid vary from labo-\nratory to laboratory but are generally found within thefollowing range: Male: 2.1–8.5 mg/dL; female: 2.0–6.6mg/dL. Values may be slightly higher in the elderly.\nUrine test\nReference values for 24-hour urinary uric acid vary\nfrom laboratory to laboratory but are generally foundwithin the following range: 250–750 mg/24 hours.\nAbnormal results\nThe critical value for the blood test is a level of uric\nacid higher than 12 milligrams per deciliter (about 3.4ounces).\nIncreased production of uric acid may result from\neating foods that are high in purine. Increased uric acidlevels due to overproduction may also be caused by gout,by a genetic disorder of purine metabolism, or bymetastatic cancer , destruction of red blood cells,\nleukemia, or cancer chemotherapy .\nDecreased excretion of uric acid is seen in chronic kid-\nney disease, low thyroid, toxemia of pregnancy , and alco-\nholism . Patients with gout excrete less than half the uric\nacid in their blood as other persons. Only 10-15% of thetotal cases of hyperuricemia, however, are caused by gout.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3442Uric acid testsAbnormally low uric acid levels may indicate that\nthe patient is taking allopurinol or probenecid for treat-ment of gout; may be pregnant; or suffers from Wilson’sdisease or Fanconi’s syndrome .\nResources\nBOOKS\nJacobs, David S., et al.

Twenty-four-hour\nurine studies are often ordered for these tests\n• diagnosis of diseases or disorders of the kidneys or uri-\nnary tract\n• monitoring of patients with diabetes\n• testing for pregnancy\n• screening for drug abuse\nPrecautions\nV oided specimens\nUrinalysis should not be performed while a woman\nis menstruating or having a vaginal discharge. A womanwho must have a urinalysis while she has a vaginal dis-charge or is having her period should insert a fresh tam-pon before beginning the test. She should also hold apiece of clean material over the entrance to her vagina toavoid contaminating the specimen.\nPatients do not have to fast or change their food\nintake before a urine test. They should, however, avoidintense athletic training or heavy physical work beforethe test because it may result in small amounts of bloodin the urine.\nThe following drugs can affect urinalysis results.\nThe patient may be asked to stop taking them until afterthe test:\n• Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin, Furadantin). Nitrofuran-\ntoin is prescribed for infections of the urinary tract andother bacterial infections. \n• Phenazopyridine (Pyridium). This medication is used to\nrelieve burning and pain caused by urinary-tract infec-\ntions. \n• Rifampin (Rifadin). This medication is prescribed to\ntreat tuberculosis , prevent the spread of meningitis ,\nand treat other infections.\nBladder catheterization\nBladder catheterization is sometimes used to collect\nurine samples from hospitalized patients. It should not,however, be used to collect specimens from males with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3443Urinalysisacute inflammation of the prostate or from a patient of\neither sex with a fractured pelvis.\nDescription\nCollecting a urine sample from emptying the blad-\nder takes about two or three minutes. The sample can becollected at home as well as in a doctor’s office. Urinespecimens are usually collected early in the morningbefore breakfast. Urine collected eight hours after eatingand at least six hours after the most recent urination ismore likely to indicate abnormalities. Some people maybe asked to void into a clean container before getting outof bed in the morning.\nSpecimen containers\nThe doctor or hospital will supply a sterile container\nfor a specimen being collected for a colony count. Acolony count is a test that detects bacteria in urine thathas been cultured for 24–48 hours. It is used instead of aroutine urinalysis when a patient’s symptoms suggest aurinary tract infection. Nonsterile containers can be usedfor routine specimens that will not be tested immediatelyafter being collected. An ordinary open-necked jar maybe used after it and its lid have been soaked in very hotwater for 15–20 minutes and then air-dried.\nLaboratory procedures\nSTORAGE. Urine specimens should not remain unre-\nfrigerated for longer than two hours. A urine specimenthat cannot be delivered to a laboratory within two hoursshould be stored in a refrigerator. The reason for this pre-caution is that urine samples undergo chemical changesat room temperature. Blood cells begin to dissolve andthe urine loses its acidity.\nVISUAL EXAMINATION. A doctor, nurse, or laborato-\nry technician will look at the specimen to see if the urineis red, cloudy, or looks unusual in any way. He or shewill also note any unusual odor.\nTESTING TECHNIQUES. Urine samples are tested\nwith a variety of different instruments and techniques.Some tests use dipsticks, which are thin strips of plasticthat change color in the presence of specific substances.Dipsticks can be used to measure the acidity of the urine(its pH) or the presence of blood, protein, sugar, or sub-stances produced during the breakdown of fatty acids(ketones). A urinometer is used to compare the density ofthe urine specimen with the density of plain water. Thismeasurement is called specific gravity.\nThe urine specimen is also examined under a micro-\nscope to determine whether it contains blood cells, crys-tals, or small pieces of fibrous material (casts).Preparation\nV oided specimens\nMost urine specimens from adults or older children\nare collected by the patient’s voiding into a suitable con-tainer. Soaps and disinfectants may contaminate urinespecimens and should not be used. The doctor or labora-tory may supply a special antiseptic solution that won’tirritate the skin. The method for collection varies some-what according to age and sex.\nWOMEN AND GIRLS. Before collecting a urine\nsample, a woman or girl should use a clean cotton ballmoistened with lukewarm water to cleanse the externalgenital area. Gently separating the folded skin (labia)on either side of her vagina, she should move the cot-ton ball from the front of the area to the back. Afterrepeating this process several times, using a fresh pieceof cotton each time, she should dry the area with aclean towel.\nTo prevent menstrual blood, vaginal discharge, or\ngerms from the external genitalia from contaminating thespecimen, a woman or girl should release some urinebefore she begins to collect her sample. A urine speci-men obtained this way is called a midstream clean catch.\nMEN AND BOYS. A man or boy should use a piece\nof clean cotton, moistened with antiseptic, to cleansethe head of his penis and the passage through whichurine leaves his body (the urethral meatus). He shoulddraw back his foreskin if he has not been circumcised.He should move the cotton in a circular motion awayfrom the urinary opening, using a fresh piece of cottoneach time. After repeating this process several times,he should use a fresh piece of cotton to remove theantiseptic. After the area has been thoroughlycleansed, he should begin urinating and collect a smallsample in a container without interrupting the streamof urine.\nINFANTS. A parent, nurse, or doctor should\ncleanse the child’s genitals and as much of the sur-rounding area as will fit into the sterile urine-collectionbag provided by the hospital. When the area has beenthoroughly cleansed, the bag should be attached to thechild’s genital area and left in place until the child hasurinated. It is important to remember not to touch theinside of the bag and to remove it as soon as a speci-men has been obtained.\nBladder catheterization\nBladder catheterization is a hospital procedure\nused to collect uncontaminated urine when the patientcannot void. A catheter is a thin flexible tube that thedoctor inserts through the urethra into the bladder to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3444Urinalysisallow urine to flow out. To minimize the risk of infect-\ning the patient’s bladder with bacteria, many doctorsuse a so-called Robinson catheter, which is a plain rub-ber or latex tube that is removed as soon as the speci-men is collected.\nSuprapubic bladder aspiration is a technique that is\nsometimes used to collect urine from infants youngerthan six months. The doctor withdraws urine from thebladder into a syringe through a needle inserted throughthe skin over the bladder. This technique is used onlywhen the child cannot void because of an abnormal ure-thra or if he or she has a urinary tract infection that hasnot responded to treatment.\nAftercare\nThe patient may return to normal activities after col-\nlecting the sample and may start taking medications thatwere discontinued before the test.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with voided speci-\nmens. The risk of bladder infection from catheterizationwith a Robinson catheter is about 3%.\nNormal results\nContents and appearance\nNormal urine is a clear straw-colored liquid. It has a\nslight odor. It contains some crystals, a small number ofcells from the tissues that line the bladder, and transpar-ent (hyaline) casts. Normal urine does notcontain sug-\nars, yeast cells, protein, ketones, bacteria, or parasiticorganisms.\nThe time of day a urine sample is collected can\nmake a difference in the appearance of the specimen.Some foods and medicines, including red beets, aspara-gus, and penicillin, can affect the color or smell of urine.Although most color variations are harmless, they some-times indicate the presence of serious disease. A doctor,nurse, or laboratory technician should be notified if theurine is red or cloudy or looks unusual in any way.\nAcidity\nThe pH of normal urine is 4.5–8.0. Its specific gravi-\nty is 1.0005–1.035.\nAbnormal results\nCloudiness\nUrine may be cloudy (turbid) because it contains red\nor white blood cells, bacteria, fat, mucus, digestive fluid(chyle), or pus from a bladder or kidney infection.Odor\nFoul-smelling urine is a common symptom of uri-\nnary-tract infection. A fruity odor is associated with dia-\nbetes mellitus ,starvation and dehydration , or ketone\nformation. Other distinctive odors are present in the urineof patients with maple syrup urine disease or phenylke-\ntonuria (PKU).\nSpecific gravity\nThe specific gravity of urine can be affected by a range\nof diseases and disorders. Low specific gravity (below1.005) is associated with diabetes insipidus , nephrogenic\ndiabetes insipidus, acute tubular necrosis, and inflammationof the upper urinary tract ( pyelonephritis ). In fixed specific\ngravity, the specific gravity of the urine remains at 1.010 nomatter how much fluid the person drinks. This conditionoccurs in patients who have chronic inflammation of thesmall blood vessels in the kidneys ( glomerulonephritis )\nand serious kidney damage. High specific gravity (above1.035) occurs in patients who are in shock or who suffer\nfrom nephrotic syndrome , dehydration, acute glomeru-\nlonephritis, congestive heart failure , or liver failure.\npH\nA pH factor greater than 7 (more alkaline) may\nresult from Fanconi’s syndrome , urinary tract infec-\ntions, or metabolic or respiratory alkalosis . A pH factor\nbelow 7 (more acid) may be due to fever , PKU, the\nsecretion of homogentisic acid in the urine (alkap-tonuria), and acidosis.\nBlood and tissue cells\nRed blood cells in the urine can be due to vigorous\nexercise or exposure to toxic chemicals. Bloody urine can\nalso be a sign of bleeding in the genitourinary tract as aresult of systemic bleeding disorders, various kidney dis-eases, bacterial infections, parasitic infections includingmalaria , obstructions in the urinary tract, scurvy , subacute\nbacterial endocarditis , traumatic injuries, and tumors.\nA high number of white blood cells in the urine is\nusually a symptom of urinary tract infection. A largenumber of cells from tissue lining (epithelial cells) canindicate damage to the small tubes that carry materialinto and out of the kidneys.\nCasts\nCasts are small fibrous objects that are formed when\nprotein and other materials settle in the kidney tubulesand collecting ducts. Casts are dislodged by normal urineflow. A large number of them in a urine specimen is asign of kidney disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3445UrinalysisCrystals\nThere are several different chemicals in body fluids that\ncan form crystals that appear in urine. Some of these appearin normal urine, such as calcium oxalate or uric acid crys-tals. A large number of calcium oxalate crystals, however,may be a sign of abnormally high levels of calcium in theblood ( hypercalcemia ). Other crystals, including tyrosine,\nleucine, and cholesterol, are abnormal. The presence of cys-tine crystals is a symptom of excessive urinary secretion ofcystine ( cystinuria ). Cystine is an acid found in many pro-\nteins and normally reabsorbed by the kidney tubules.\nProtein\nProtein in the urine can be a symptom of kidney\nstones , inflammation of the kidneys, degenerative kidney\ndisease, or multiple tumors.\nSugars\nA high level of glucose and other sugars in the urine\n(glycosuria) is often a symptom of diabetes mellitus.Glycosuria can also be caused by advanced kidney dis-ease, Cushing’s syndrome , impaired tubular reabsorp-\ntion, shock, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland ( pheochro-\nmocytoma ), or cancer of the pancreas.\nMilk in the urine is normal if a woman is pregnant,\nhas just given birth, or is breastfeeding. On the otherKEY TERMS\nAcidosis —A condition of the blood in which bicar-\nbonate levels are below normal.\nAlkalosis —A condition of the blood and other body\nfluids in which bicarbonate levels are higher thannormal.\nCasts —Small fibrous objects formed from materials\nthat collect in the kidney tubules and are washedout by normal urine flow.\nCatheter —A thin flexible tube inserted through the\nurethra into the bladder to allow urine to flow out.\nClean catch specimen —A urine specimen that is\ncollected from the middle of the urine stream afterthe first part of the flow has been voided.\nColony count —A measurement of the growth of\nbacteria in a urine sample that has been cultured for24 to 48 hours.\nFanconi’s syndrome —A rare disorder caused by vit-\namin D deficiency or exposure to heavy metals.Ketones —Substances produced during the break-\ndown of fatty acids. They are produced in excessiveamounts in diabetes and certain other abnormalconditions.\nNephrotic syndrome —A condition characterized\nby water retention, little or no protein in urine, andhigh blood cholesterol.\npH—A chemical symbol used to describe the acidi-\nty or alkalinity of a fluid, ranging from 0 (more acid)to 14 (more alkaline).\nUrethra —The duct that carries urine from the blad-\nder to the outside of the body.\nUrinalysis (plural, urinalyses) —The diagnostic test-\ning of a urine sample.\nVoiding —Another word for emptying the bladder or\nurinating.\nhand, rare hereditary metabolic disorders are indicated\nwhen urine contains fruit sugar (fructose), milk sugar(galactose), or a simple sugar called pentose.\nKetones\nThe presence of abnormally high numbers of\nketones in the urine (ketonuria) usually results fromuncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Ketonuria can also becaused by prolonged diarrhea or vomiting that results in\nstarvation.\nBilirubin\nBilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment found in bile,\na fluid secreted by the liver. When it is found in urine,bilirubin may be a symptom of liver disease caused bythe formation of fibrous tissue, medications that damagethe liver, or obstructive jaundice .\nUrobilinogen\nBacteria in the small intestine can convert bilirubin\nto urobilinogen, which is excreted in the feces, in bile, orin urine. An accumulation of urobilinogen in the urinemay be a sign of severe infection, liver damage, or dis-eases that destroy red blood cells. Low levels of uro-bilinogen in the urine may be a result of antimicrobialtherapy, inflammatory diseases, kidney disease, severediarrhea, or blocked bile ducts.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3446UrinalysisOther findings\nThe presence of bacteria, parasites, or yeast cells in\nthe urine may be a symptom of urinary tract infection orcontamination of the external genitalia.

    "title": "Urinary anti-infectives",
    "content": "Urinary anti-infectives\nDefinition\nUrinary anti-infectives are medicines used to treat or\nprevent infections of the urinary tract—the passage throughwhich urine flows from the kidneys out of the body.\nPurpose\nNormally, no bacteria or other disease-causing organ-\nisms live in the bladder. Likewise, the urethra—the tube-like structure that carries urine from the bladder out of thebody—usually has either no bacteria or not enough tocause problems. But the bladder, urethra, and other parts ofthe urinary tract may become infected when disease-caus-ing organisms invade from other body regions or from out-side the body. Urinary anti-infectives are used to treat suchinfections or to prevent them in people who get them often.\nDescription\nCommonly used urinary anti-infectives include\nmethenamine (Urex, Hiprex, Mandelamine), nalidixicacid (NegGram) and nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Furatoin,and other brands). These medicines are available onlywith a physician’s prescription and come in capsule,tablet, granule, and liquid forms.\nRecommended dosage\nMethenamine\nFor adults and children 12 years and over, the usual\ndosage is 1 gram, taken either twice a day or four times aday, depending on the form in which the drug comes. Forchildren aged 6–12 years, the dosage ranges from 500mg taken 2–4 times a day to 1 gram taken twice a day,again depending on the form of the drug. For childrenunder 6 years, a physician must determine the dose.\nThis medicine will not work properly unless the\nurine is acidic, with a pH reading of 5.5 or below. Thephysician who prescribes the medicine will explain howto test the urine’s acidity. The physician also may suggestdiet changes that will make the urine more acidic, suchas eating more protein, drinking cranberry juice, eatingplums and prunes, but avoiding most other fruits, andcutting down on milk and other dairy products. Antacids\nalso should be avoided.\nNalidixic acid\nThe recommended dosage for adults and children 12\nyears and older is 1 gram every 6 hours. If the medicineis taken for more than one or two weeks, the dosage maybe decreased to 500 mg every 6 hours. A physician mustdetermine the correct dosage for children 3 months to 12years old. Children under 3 months should not take thismedicine because it causes bone problems in young ani-mals and could have the same effect in young children.\nNitrofurantoin\nCAPSULES, TABLETS, OR LIQUID. The usual dose for\nadults and teenagers is 50–100 mg every six hours.\nEXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES. For adults and chil-\ndren 12 years and older, the usual dosage is 100 mgevery 12 hours for seven days. \nFor all forms of nitrofurantoin, a physician must\ndetermine the correct dose for children one month andolder, based on the child’s body weight. Children underone month should not take this medicine.\nPrecautions\nMethenamine\nPeople with certain medical conditions may have\nproblems if they take this medicine. For example, people\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3447Urinary anti-infectiveswith severe liver disease may have worsened symptoms\nof their disease. And people who are dehydrated or whohave severe kidney disease may be more likely to haveside effects that affect the kidneys.\nNalidixic acid\nSome people feel drowsy, dizzy, or less alert than\nusual when using this drug. The medicine may also causeblurred vision or other vision changes. Because of thesepossible problems, anyone who takes nalidixic acidshould not drive, operate machinery, or do anything elsethat might be dangerous until they have found out howthe drugs affect them.\nNalidixic acid may increase sensitivity to sunlight.\nEven brief exposure to sun can cause a severe sunburn or a\nrash. While being treated with this medicine, avoid being indirect sunlight, especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.; weara hat and tightly woven clothing that covers the arms andlegs; use a sunscreen with a skin protection factor (SPF) ofat least 15; protect the lips with a sun block lipstick; and donot use tanning beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.\nDiabetic patients should be aware that this medicine\nmay cause false results on some urine sugar tests. Checkwith a physician before making any changes in diet ordiabetes medicine based on the results of a urine test.\nIn laboratory studies, nalidixic acid interferes with\nbone development in young animals. The drug’s effectshave not been studied in pregnant women, but because ofits effects in animals, it is not recommended for use dur-ing pregnancy .\nThis medicine generally does not cause problems in\nnursing babies whose mothers take it. However, nursingbabies with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)deficiency (an inherited disorder that affects mainlyblack males) may have blood problems if their motherstake nalidixic acid.\nPeople with certain medical conditions may be more\nlikely to have particular side effects if they take this medi-cine. For example, people with a history of seizures orsevere hardening of the arteries in the brain may be morelikely to have side effects that affect the nervous system.People with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)deficiency are more likely to have side effects that affectthe blood. Also, people with liver disease or severe kidneydisease have an increased chance of having any of thedrug’s possible side effects.\nNitrofurantoin\nPregnant women should not take this medicine with-\nin two weeks of their delivery date and should not use itduring labor and delivery, as this could cause problems inthe baby.Women who are breastfeeding should check with\ntheir physicians before using this medicine. It passes intobreast milk and could cause problems in nursing babieswhose mothers take it. This is especially true of babieswith glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi-ciency. The medicine also should not be given directly tobabies up to one month of age, as they are particularlysensitive to its effects.\nOlder people may be more likely to have side effects\nwhen taking nitrofurantoin, because they are more sensi-tive to the drug’s effects.\nTaking nitrofurantoin may cause problems for peo-\nple with certain medical conditions. Side effects may begreater, for example, in people with lung disease or nervedamage. In people with kidney disease, the medicinemay not work as well as it should, but may cause moreside effects. Those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-nase (G6PD) deficiency who take nitrofurantoin maydevelop anemia.\nDiabetic patients should be aware that this medicine\nmay cause false results on some urine sugar tests. Theyshould check with a physician before making anychanges in diet or diabetes medicine based on the resultsof a urine test.\nGeneral precautions for all urinary anti-infectives\nSymptoms should improve within a few days of\nstarting to take a urinary anti-infective. If they do not, orif they become worse, check with a physician right away.Patients who need to take this medicine for long periodsshould see their physicians regularly, so that the physi-cian can check their progress.\nAnyone who has had unusual reactions to urinary\nanti-infectives in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes,\npreservatives, or other substances. Patients takingnalidixic acid should tell their physicians if they haveever had reactions to related medicines such as cinoxacin(Cinobac), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), enoxacin (Penetrex),norfloxacin (Noroxin) or ofloxacin (Floxin), all of whichare also used to treat or prevent infections. Anyone tak-ing nitrofurantoin should let the physician know if he orshe has had an unusual reaction to medicines such asfurazolidone (Furoxone) or nitrofurazone (Furacin).\nSide effects\nMethenamine\nNausea and vomiting are not common but may occur.\nThese side effects do not need medical attention unless\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3448Urinary anti-infectivesthey are severe. One side effect that should be brought to a\nphysician’s attention immediately is a skin rash.\nNalidixic acid\nSome side effects are fairly minor and are likely to go\naway as the body adjusts to the drug. These include dizzi-\nness, drowsiness, headache , nausea or vomiting, stomach\npain and diarrhea . Unless these problems continue or\nare bothersome, they do not need medical attention.\nOther side effects, however, should have prompt\nmedical attention. Anyone who has changes in vision,such as blurred vision, double vision, decreased vision,changes in color vision, halos around lights, or notices anexcessive brightness of lights should check with a physi-cian immediately.\nNitrofurantoin\nThis medicine may make the urine turn reddish-yel-\nlow to brown. This is nothing to worry about. Other pos-sible side effects that do not need medical attentionunless they are severe include pain in the stomach orabdomen, stomach upset, diarrhea, loss of appetite, andnausea or vomiting.\nAnyone who has chest pain, breathing problems,\nfever , chills, or a cough while taking nitrofurantoin\nshould check with a physician immediately.\nGeneral advice on side effects for all urinary anti-\ninfectives\nOther side effects are possible when taking any uri-\nnary anti-infective. Anyone who has unusual symptomswhile taking this type of medicine should get in touchwith his or her physician.\nInteractions\nMethenamine\nCertain medicines may make methenamine less\neffective. These include thiazide diuretics (water pills)\nand medicines that make the urine less acid, such asantacids, bicarbonate of soda, and the drugs acetazo-lamide (Diamox), dichlorphenamide (Daranide), and met-hazolamide (Neptazane), which are used to treat glauco-\nma, epilepsy, altitude sickness , and other conditions.\nNalidixic acid \nPeople who are taking blood thinners (anticoagu-\nlants) may be more likely to have bleeding problems ifthey take this medicine.KEY TERMS\nAltitude sickness —A set of symptoms that people\nwho normally live at low altitudes may have whenthey travel to high altitudes. The symptoms includenosebleed, nausea, and shortness of breath.\nAnemia —A lack of hemoglobin—the compound\nin blood that carries oxygen from the lungsthroughout the body and brings waste carbon diox-ide from the cells to the lungs, where it is released.\nBacteria —Tiny, one-celled forms of life that cause\nmany diseases and infections.\nGlaucoma —A condition in which pressure in the\neye is abnormally high. If not treated, glaucomamay lead to blindness.\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)\ndeficiency —An inherited disorder in which the\nbody lacks an enzyme that normally protects redblood cells from toxic chemicals. When peoplewith this condition take certain drugs, their redblood cells break down, causing anemia. This mayalso happen when they have a fever or an infec-tion. The condition usually occurs in males. About10% of black males have it, as do a small percent-age of people from the Mediterranean region.\nGranule —A small grain or pellet. Medicines that\ncome in granule form usually are mixed with liq-uids or sprinkled on food before they are taken.\nOrganism —An individual of some type of life\nform, such as a plant or an animal.\npH—A measure of how acidic or alkaline some-\nthing is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. Valuesbelow 7 are acidic; values above 7 are alkaline.\nSeizure —A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.\nNitrofurantoin\nNitrofurantoin may interact with many other medi-\ncines. For example, taking nitrofurantoin with certaindrugs that include methyldopa (Aldomet), sulfonamides\n(sulfa drugs), vitamin K, and diabetes medicines takenby mouth may increase the chance of side effects thataffect the blood. General side effects are more likely inpeople who take nitrofurantoin with the gout drugs\nprobenecid (Benemid) or sulfinpyrazone (Anturane).And the risk of side effects that involve the nervous sys-tem is higher in people who take nitrofurantoin with vari-ous drugs including lithium (Lithane), disulfiram(Antabuse), other anti-infectives, and the cancer drugs\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3449Urinary anti-infectivescisplatin (Platinol) and vincristine (Oncovin). Patients\nwho have had a DPT ( diphtheria ,tetanus , and pertus-\nsis) vaccine within the last 30 days or who have one aftertaking nitrofurantoin are also more likely to have sideeffects that affect the nervous system. Because of themany possible interactions, anyone taking nitrofurantoinshould be sure to check with a physician before combin-ing it with any other medicine.\nGeneral advice about interactions\nNot every drug that may interact with a urinary anti-\ninfective is listed here.

    "title": "Urinary catheterization",
    "content": "Urinary catheterization\nDefinition\nUrinary catheterization is the insertion of a catheter\ninto a patient’s bladder. The catheter is used as a conduitto drain urine from the bladder into an attached bag orcontainer.\nPurpose\nUrinary catheterization is employed in hospital and\nnursing home settings to maintain urine output inpatients who are undergoing surgery, or who are con-fined to the bed and physically unable to use a bedpan.Critically ill patients who require strict monitoring of uri-nary output are also frequently catheterized.\nIntermittent insertion of a urinary catheter is a treat-\nment option for patients with certain types of urinary\nincontinence . Patients who are unable to completely\nempty the bladder during urination (urinary retention), orpatients who have a bladder obstruction, may also requireintermittent urinary catheterization. Disabled individualswith neurological disorders that cause paralysis or a loss\nof sensation in the perineal area may also use regularintermittent catheter insertion to void their bladders.Precautions\nBecause urinary catheterization carries a risk of\ncausing urinary tract infection (UTI), precautions shouldbe used to keep the catheter clean and free of bacteria.Patients requiring intermittent catheterization should bewell trained in the technique by a qualified health careprofessional.\nDescription\nIntermittent catheterization is performed a minimum\nof four times a day by the patient or a care giver. The geni-tal area near the urethral opening is wiped with an antisep-tic agent, such as iodine. A lubricant may be used to facili-tate the entry of the catheter into the urethra, and a topicallocal anesthetic may be applied to numb the urethral open-ing during the procedure. One end of the catheter is placedin a container, and the other end is inserted into and guidedup the urethra until urine flow begins. When urine flowstops, the catheter may be moved or rotated, or the patientmay change positions to ensure that all urine has emptiedfrom the bladder. The catheter is then withdrawn, cleaned,and sterilized for the next use. Recommended cleaningpractices vary, from the use of soap and water to submer-sion in boiling water or a disinfectant solution. Somepatients prefer to use a new catheter with each insertion.\nNonintermittent catheterization, which is initiated in\na hospital or nursing home setting, uses the same basictechnique for insertion of the urinary tract catheter. Thecatheter is inserted by a nurse or other health care profes-sional, and remains in the patient until bladder functioncan be maintained independently. When the catheter isremoved, patients will experience a pulling sensation andmay feel some minor discomfort. If the catheter isrequired for an extended period of time, a long-term,indwelling catheter, such as a Foley catheter, is used. Toprevent infection, it should be regularly exchanged for anew catheter every three to six weeks.\nUse of indwelling catheters should be restricted to\npatients whose incontinence is caused by urinary tractobstruction that can not be treated, and for which alterna-tive therapy is not feasible.\nPreparation\nIf a patient wishes to perform intermittent catheteri-\nzation himself, training in the technique by a qualifiedhealth care professional is required. Basic instruction inthe anatomy, antiseptic techniques, catheter insertion, andproper catheter care should be provided. Patients learningchronic intermittent urinary catheterization may also ben-efit from an ultrasound examination to verify that they arecompletely emptying their bladder during the procedure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3450Urinary catheterizationAftercare\nPatients using intermittent catheterization as a treat-\nment for incontinence will experience a period of adjust-ment as they try to establish a catheterization schedulethat is adequate for their normal level of fluid intake.\nAntibiotics may be prescribed as a preventative\nmeasure in long-term urinary catheterization patientswho are at risk for urinary tract infection.\nA patient with an indwelling catheter must be\nreassessed periodically to determine whether alternativetreatment may be more effective in treating the problem.\nRisks\nTrauma to the urethra and/or bladder may result\nfrom incorrect insertion of the catheter. Repeated irrita-tion to the urethra during catheter insertion may causescarring and/or stricture, or narrowing, of the urethra.The catheter may introduce bacteria into the urethra andbladder, resulting in urinary tract infection. UTI cancause fever and inflammation of the bladder and urethra.\nPatients who practice intermittent catheterization canreduce their risks for UTI by using antiseptic techniquesfor insertion and catheter care.KEY TERMS\nBladder obstruction —A blockage of the bladder\ncaused by the presence of calculi (e.g., mineraldeposits) or an anatomic abnormality.\nCatheter —A long, thin, flexible tube.\nFoley catheter —A two-channel catheter with a\nballoon on the bladder end of one channel. Onceinflated, the balloon keeps the catheter securely inthe bladder. The other channel of the catheterfacilitates the flow of urine out of the bladder.\nLocal anesthetic —Medication applied topically to\nthe skin or administered through an injection thatdeadens a specific part of the body and inhibitsthe sensation of pain.\nPerineal area —The genital area between the vulva\nand anus in a woman, and between the scrotumand anus in a man.\nUltrasound examination —A diagnostic test that\nuses sound waves to generate a picture of anorgan or organ system.\nUrinary incontinence —The inability to control\none’s urine flow.Normal results\nWhen used correctly, catheterization facilitates com-\nplete voiding of the bladder.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nHunt, Gillian M., Pippa Oakeshott, and Robert Whitaker.\n“Intermittent Catheterization: Simple, Safe, and Effectivebut Underused.” British Medical Journal 312, no. 7023\n(Jan. 1996): 103-7.\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health\nService, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.“Urinary Incontinence in Adults: Acute and Chronic Man-agement.” Clinical Practice Guideline no. 2 (1996).\nPaula Anne Ford-Martin"

    "title": "Urinary diversion surgery",
    "content": "Urinary diversion surgery\nDefinition\nA urinary diversion involves removal of the urinary\nbladder and adjacent tissues and organs, and re-routingof the urinary stream. This may involve creation of anartificial opening in the abdomen called an ostomy .\nPurpose\nA urinary diversion is created as a means to treat\ncancer of the bladder, when conservative measures have\nbeen unsuccessful, or when there is recurrence of the dis-ease invading the muscle wall. Congenital deformities ortraumatic injury may also necessitate formation of a uri-nary diversion.\nDescription\nUnder general anesthesia, an incision is made in the\nabdomen. The ureters (tubes that carry urine away fromthe kidneys) are cut and tied. The bladder and surround-ing tissues are cut free and removed. The ureters are thenattached to a portion of the intestine. The most commontypes of urinary diversion are:\n• Ileal conduit. Ureters are attached to a portion of the\nsmall intestine, the ileum, one end of which is broughtthrough the abdominal wall as a conduit for the urine,creating a stoma. \n• Ureterosigmoidostomy. The ureters are attached to a\nportion of the large intestine, the sigmoid, which allowsthe urine to flow through the large intestine and outthrough the rectum. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3451Urinary diversion surgery• Cutaneous ureterostomy. Bringing the detached ureters\nthrough the abdominal wall and attaching it to an open-ing in the skin.\nFollowing creation of an artificial opening to drain\nthe urine, ureteral stents (tubes that go through the stomaand up into the ureters) are often inserted and left inplace to allow urine to drain freely from the kidneys,without risk of blockage from swelling due to surgery.The muscles are replaced and sewn together. A transpar-ent pouch is applied to the abdomen to collect urine, andattached to a bedside drainage bag. The incision is closedwith sutures or clips (“staples”), which are usuallyremoved about 1 week after surgery. \nAn alternative to a conventional urinary diversion is\nthe continent urinary diversion. In this surgical proce-dure, a “false bladder” is constructed within theabdomen, using several lengths of small or large intes-tine. The ureters are sewn to this new reservoir for urineand nipple valves are created at two sites; the abdominalwall for continence; and where the ureters are implanted,to prevent reflux of urine back to the kidneys. The patientis then taught to catheterize the reservoir to drain urine atregular intervals during the day. Although a continentdiversion is not suitable for every patient who requiresurinary diversion, it is an option to be considered.\nPreparation\nAs with any surgical procedure, the patient will be\nrequired to sign a consent form after the procedure isexplained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, alongwith various x rays and an electrocardiogram (EKG),may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If cre-ation of an ostomy is planned, the patient should visit anenterostomal therapist, who will mark an appropriateplace on the abdomen for a stoma and offer preoperativeeducation on ostomy management. \nEating or drinking is prohibited after midnight the\nnight before the surgery. Oral anti-infectives, such asneomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate, may beordered to decrease bacteria in the intestine and help pre-vent postoperative infection. A nasogastric tube is insert-ed the day of surgery, or during surgery, to remove gas-tric secretions and prevent nausea and vomiting . \nAftercare\nPostoperative care for the patient with a urinary diver-\nsion, as with those who have had any major surgery,involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations,and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because ofthe effect of anesthesia, and the patient is reluctant tobreathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by theabdominal incision. The patient is shown how to support\nthe operative site during deep breathing and coughing, andis given pain medication as necessary. Fluid intake andoutput are measured, and the operative site is observed forcolor and amount of wound drainage. The nasogastric tubewill remain in place, attached to low intermittent suction,until bowel activity resumes. Fluids and electrolytes areinfused intravenously until the patient’s diet can graduallybe resumed, beginning with liquids. The patient is usuallyable to move about in 8–24 hours after surgery, and is dis-charged from the hospital in 5–10 days.\nIf an ostomy has been placed, the patient and close\nfamily members will be educated on how to care for it.Determination of appropriate pouching supplies and aschedule of how often to change the pouch should beestablished. Regular assessment and meticulous care ofthe skin surrounding the stoma is important to maintainan adequate surface on which to apply the pouch. Thepouch should be connected to a bedside drainage bag atnight to prevent large volumes of urine from collecting inthe pouch. Otherwise, the weight of the pouch couldcause disruption of the pouch seal and leakage of urineonto the surrounding skin. Often, an enterostomal thera-pist will visit the patient at home after discharge to helpthe new ostomy patient make the transition back to nor-mal daily activities.\nRisks\nPotential complications of urinary diversion surgery\ninclude:\n• excessive bleeding \n• surgical wound infection \n• thrombophlebitis (inflammation and blood clot to veins\nin the legs) \n• pneumonia \n• pulmonary embolism (blood clot or air bubble in the\nlungs’ blood supply)\nNormal results\nComplete healing is expected without complications.\nThe amount of time required for recovery from the surgerymay vary depending of the patient’s overall health statusprior to surgery. The patient with a urinary diversion, with-out other medical complications, should be able to resumeall daily activities once recovered from the surgery.\nAbnormal results\nThe doctor should be made aware of any of the fol-\nlowing problems after surgery:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3452Urinary diversion surgery• Increased pain, swelling, redness, drainage, or bleeding\nin the surgical area \n• Headache, muscle aches, dizziness , or fever\n• Increased abdominal pain or swelling, constipation ,\nnausea, or vomiting.\nStomal complications to be monitored include:\n• Stomal tissue death (necrosis). This occurs because of\ninadequate blood supply, this is usually visible 12 to 24hours after surgery. It may require additional surgery. \n• Stoma flush or below the abdomen surface (retraction).\nCaused by insufficient stomal length, this may be man-aged by use of special pouching supplies. Elective revi-sion of the stoma is also an option. \n• Narrowing at the opening of the stoma (stenosis). Often\nassociated with infection around the stoma or scarring,mild stenosis can be removed under local anesthesia.Severe stenosis may require surgery for stomal revision. \n• Parastomal hernia . The bowel causes a bulge in the\nabdominal wall next to the stoma. This is usually due toplacement of the stoma where the abdominal wall isweak, or an overly large opening in the abdominal wall.Use of an ostomy support belt and special pouchingsupplies may be adequate. If severe, the defect in theabdominal wall should be repaired and the stomamoved to another location.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDoughty, Dorothy. Urinary and Fecal Incontinence.

    "title": "Urinary incontinence",
    "content": "Urinary incontinence\nDefinition\nUrinary incontinence is unintentional loss of urine\nthat is sufficient enough in frequency and amount tocause physical and/or emotional distress in the personexperiencing it.\nDescription\nApproximately 13 million Americans suffer from\nurinary incontinence. Women are affected by the disordermore frequently than are men; one in 10 women underage 65 suffer from urinary incontinence. Older Ameri-cans, too, are more prone to the condition. Twenty per-cent of Americans over age 65 are incontinent.\nThere are five major categories of urinary inconti-\nnence: overflow, stress , urge, functional, and reflex.\n• Overflow incontinence. Overflow incontinence is\ncaused by bladder dysfunction. Individuals with thistype of incontinence have an obstruction to the bladderor urethra, or a bladder that doesn’t contract properly.As a result, their bladders do not empty completely, andthey have problems with frequent urine leakage. \n• Stress incontinence. Stress incontinence occurs when\nan individual involuntarily loses urine after pressure isplaced on the abdomen (i.e., during exercise , sexual\nactivity, sneezing, coughing, laughing, or hugging). \n• Urge incontinence. Urge incontinence occurs when an\nindividual feels a sudden need to urinate, and cannot con-trol the urge to do so. As a consequence, urine is involun-tarily lost before the individual can get to the toilet. \n• Functional incontinence. Individuals who have control\nover their own urination and have a fully functioningurinary tract, but cannot make it to the bathroom in timedue to a physical or cognitive disability, are functional-ly incontinent. These individuals may suffer fromarthritis, Parkinson’s disease ,multiple sclerosis ,o r\nAlzheimer’s disease . \n• Reflex incontinence. Individuals with reflex inconti-\nnence lose control of their bladder without warning.They typically suffer from neurological impairment.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3453Urinary incontinenceIn some cases, an individual may develop short-term\nor acute incontinence . Acute incontinence may occur as\na symptom or by-product of illness, as a side effect ofmedication, or as a result of dietary intake. The conditionis typically easily resolved once the cause is determinedand addressed.\nCauses and symptoms\nUrinary incontinence can be caused by a wide vari-\nety of physical conditions, including:\n•Childbirth . Childbirth can weaken the pelvic muscles\nand cause the bladder to lose some support from sur-rounding muscles, resulting in stress incontinence. \n• Dysfunction of the bladder and/or the urinary sphincter.\nIn a continent individual, as the bladder contracts, theoutlet that releases urine into the urethra (bladdersphincter) opens and urine exits the body. In individualswith overflow incontinence, bladder contractions anddilation of the sphincter do not occur at the same time. \n•Enlarged prostate . In men, an enlarged prostate gland\ncan obstruct the bladder, causing overflow incontinence. \n• Hysterectomy or other gynecological surgery. Any\nsurgery involving the urogenital tract runs the risk ofdamaging or weakening the pelvic muscles and causingincontinence. • Menopause. The absence of estrogen in the post-\nmenopausal woman can cause the bladder to drop, orprolapse. \n• Neurological conditions. The nervous system sends sig-\nnals to the bladder telling it when to start and stop emp-tying. When the nervous system is impaired, inconti-nence may result. Neurological conditions such as mul-tiple sclerosis, stroke , spinal cord injuries, or a brain\ntumor may cause the bladder to contract involuntarily,\nexpelling urine without warning, or to cease contrac-tions completely, causing urinary retention. \n• Obesity. Individuals who are overweight have undue\npressure placed on their bladder and surrounding mus-cles. \n• Obstruction. A blockage at the bladder outlet may permit\nonly small amounts of urine to pass, resulting in urineretention and subsequent overflow incontinence. Tumors,calculi, and scar tissue can all block the flow of urine. Aurethral stricture, or narrow urethra caused by scarring orinflammation, may also result in urine retention.\nAcute incontinence is a temporary condition caused\nby a number of factors, including:\n• Bladder irritants. Substances in the urine that irritate\nthe bladder may cause the bladder muscle to malfunc-tion. The presence of a urinary tract infection and theingestion of excess caffeine can act as irritants. Highly\nconcentrated urine resulting from low fluid intake mayalso irritate the bladder. \n•Constipation . Constipation can cause incontinence in\nsome individuals. Stool that isn’t passed presses againstthe bladder and urethra, triggering urine leakage. \n• Illness or disease. Diabetes can greatly increase urine\nvolume, making some individuals prone to inconti-nence. Other illnesses may temporarily impair the abili-ty to recognize and control the urge to urinate, or toreach the toilet in time to do so. \n• Medications and alcohol. Medications that sedate, such\nas tranquilizers and sleeping pills, can interfere with theproper functioning of the urethral nerves and bladder.Both sedatives and alcohol can also impair an individ-ual’s ability to recognize the need to urinate, and act onthat need in a timely manner. Other medications such asdiuretics ,muscle relaxants , and blood pressure med-\nication can also affect bladder function. \n• Surgery. Men who undergo prostate surgery can suffer\nfrom temporary stress incontinence as a result of dam-age to the urethral outlet.\nDiagnosis\nUrinary incontinence may be diagnosed by a general\npractitioner, urologist, or gynecologist. If the patient is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3454Urinary incontinence\nStrengthening the pelvic floor muscles by performing Kegel\nexercises helps to alleviate stress incontinence in women.Contract the pelvic floor muscles as if stopping an imagin-ery flow of urine. Hold for 10 seconds and repeat. (Illustration\nby Electronic Illustrators Group.)over age 65, a geriatrician may diagnose and treat the\ncondition. A thorough medical history and physical\nexamination is typically performed, along with specific\ndiagnostic testing to determine the cause of the inconti-nence. Diagnostic testing may include x rays, ultrasound,urine tests, and a physical examination of the pelvis. Itmay also include a series of exams that measure bladderpressure and capacity and the urinary flow (urodynamictesting). The patient may also be asked to keep a diary torecord urine output, frequency, and any episodes ofincontinence over a period of several days or a week.\nTreatment\nThere are numerous invasive and noninvasive treat-\nment options for urinary incontinence:\n•Bladder training . Used to treat urge incontinence,\nbladder training involves placing a patient on a toiletingschedule. The time interval between urination is thengradually increased until an acceptable time periodbetween bathroom breaks is consistently achieved. \n• Biofeedback. The use of sensors to monitor temperature\nand muscle contractions in the vagina to help inconti-nent patients learn to control their pelvic muscles. \n• Collagen injections. Collagen injected in the tissue sur-\nrounding the urethra can provide urethral support forwomen suffering from stress incontinence. \n• Inflatable urethral insert. Sold under the tradename\nReliance, this disposable incontinence balloon forwomen is inserted into the urethra and inflated to pre-vent urine leakage. \n• Intermittent urinary catheterization . The periodic\ninsertion of a catheter into a patient’s bladder to drainurine from the bladder into an attached bag or container. \n• Medication. Estrogen hormone replacement therapy\ncan help improve pelvic muscle tone in postmenopausalwomen. Anticholinergics (i.e., propantheline, or Pro-Banthine) and antispasmodics (i.e., oxybutynin, orDitropan) are sometimes prescribed to relax the bladdermuscles. Other over-the-counter medications such aspseudoephedrine (i.e., Actifed, Benadryl, Dimetapp)and phenylpropanolamine (i.e., Dexatrim, Acutrim) maybe prescribed to tighten the urethral sphincter. \n• Pelvic toning exercises. Exercises to tone the pelvic\nmuscle can help alleviate stress incontinence in bothmen and women. These exercises involve tightening themuscles of the pelvic floor, and are also known asKegel or PC muscle exercises. \n• Perineal stimulation. Perineal stimulation is used to\ntreat stress incontinence. The treatment uses a probe todeliver a painless electrical current to the perineal area\nmuscles. The current tones the muscle by contracting it. \n• Permanent catheterization. A permanent, or indwelling,\ncatheter may be prescribed for chronic incontinencethat doesn’t respond to other treatments. A Foleycatheter is usually used for urinary catheterization. Oneend is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder,and the external end is attached to a plastic reservoirbag that the patient may wear on the leg. A secondalternative is a permanent catheter, called a suprapubictube, surgically inserted into the bladder. The tube exitsthe body through the abdomen near the pubic bone,where it is attached to a drainage bag. As infection mayresult, this treatment should be reevaluated periodically,and the possibility of alternative treatment addressed. \n• Surgery. Bladder neck suspension surgery is used to\ncorrect female urinary stress incontinence. Surgicaltechniques such as the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz andBurch procedures use sutures to raise and support thebladder neck and urethra. A sling procedure, whichuses a strip of biocompatible material or the patient’sown muscle or tissue as a supportive sling under theurethra and bladder neck, may also be used to treatstress incontinence. Bladder enlargement surgery maybe recommended to treat incontinent men and womenwith unusually small bladders. \n• Urinary sphincter implant. An artificial urinary sphinc-\nter may be used to treat incontinence in men andwomen with urinary sphincter impairment. \n• Vaginal inserts. Devices constructed of silicone or other\npliable materials that can be inserted into a woman’svagina to support the urethra.\nPrognosis\nLeft untreated, incontinence can cause physical and\nemotional upheaval. Individuals with long-term inconti-nence suffer from urinary tract infections, and skin rashes\nand sores. Incontinence can also affect their self-esteemand cause depression and social withdrawal. They fre-quently stop participating in physical activities they onceenjoyed because of the risk of embarrassing “accidents.”However, with the wide variety of treatment options forincontinence available today, the prognosis for inconti-nent patients is promising. If incontinence cannot bestopped, it can be improved in the majority of cases.\nPrevention\nWomen who are pregnant or who have gone through\nchildbirth can reduce their risk for stress incontinence bystrengthening their perineal area muscles with Kegelexercises. Men who have undergone prostate surgery\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3455Urinary incontinencemay also benefit from pelvic muscle exercises. Men and\nwomen should consult with their doctor before initiatingany type of exercise program.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBlaivas, Jerry.

The health care provider should be informedof any antibiotics currently or recently taken.\nDescription\nThere are several different methods for collection of\na urine sample. The most common is the midstreamclean-catch technique. Hands should be washed beforebeginning. For females, the external genitalia (sexorgans) are washed two or three times with a cleansingagent and rinsed with water. In males, the external headof the penis is similarly cleansed and rinsed. The patientis then instructed to begin to urinate, and the urine is col-lected midstream into a sterile container. In infants, a uri-nary collection bag (plastic bag with an adhesive seal onone end) is attached over the labia in girls or a boy’spenis to collect the specimen.\nAnother method is the catheterized urine specimen\nin which a lubricated catheter (thin rubber tube) is insert-ed through the urethra (tube-like structure in which urineis expelled from the bladder) into the bladder. Thisavoids contamination from the urethra or external geni-talia. If the patient already has a urinary catheter in place,a urine specimen may be collected by clamping the tub-ing below the collection port and using a sterile needleand syringe to obtain the urine sample; urine cannot betaken from the drainage bag, as it is not fresh and has hadan opportunity to grow bacteria at room temperature. Onrare occasions, the health care provider may collect aurine sample by inserting a needle directly into the blad-der (suprapubic tap) and draining the urine; this methodis used only when a sample is needed quickly.\nNegative culture results showing no bacterial growth\nare available after 24 hours. Positive results require24–72 hours to complete identification of the numberand type of bacteria found.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3456Urine culturePreparation\nDrinking a glass of water 15–20 minutes before the\ntest is helpful if there is no urge to urinate. There are noother special preparations or aftercare required for the test.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with the culture test\nitself. If insertion of a urinary catheter (thin rubber tube)is required to obtain the urine, there is a slight risk ofintroducing infection from the catheter.\nNormal results\nNo growth of bacteria is considered the normal\nresult, and this indicates absence of infection.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal results, or a positive test, where bacteria\nare found in the specimen, may indicate a urinary tractinfection. Contamination of the specimen from hair,external genitalia, or the rectum may cause a false-posi-tive result. Identification of the number and type of bac-teria, with consideration of the method used in obtainingthe specimen, is significant in diagnosis.\nEscherichia coli causes approximately 80% of\ninfections in patients without catheters, abnormalities ofthe urinary tract, or calculi (stones). Other bacteria thataccount for a smaller portion of uncomplicated infectionsinclude Proteus klebsiella and Enterobacter .\nResources\nBOOKS\nDavid, Alan K., et al.

    "content": "Uterine fibroids\nDefinition\nUterine fibroids (also called leiomyomas or myomas)\nare benign growths of the muscle inside the uterus. Theyare not cancerous, nor are they related to cancer . Fibroids\ncan cause a wide variety of symptoms, including heavymenstrual bleeding and pressure on the pelvis.\nDescription\nUterine fibroids are extremely common. About 25%\nof women in their reproductive years have noticeablefibroids. There are probably many more women whohave tiny fibroids that are undetected.\nFibroids develop between the ages of 30–50. They\nare never seen in women less than 20 years old. Aftermenopause , if a woman does not take estrogen, fibroids\nshrink. It appears that African-American women aremuch more likely to develop uterine fibroids.\nFibroids are divided into different types, depending\non the location. Submucous fibroids are found in theuterine cavity; intramural fibroids grow on the wall of theuterus; and subserous fibroids are located on the outsideof the uterus. Many fibroids are so large that they fit intomore than one category. The symptoms caused byfibroids are often related to their location. \nCauses and symptoms\nNo one knows exactly what causes fibroids. Howev-\ner, the growth of fibroids appears to depend on the hor-mone estrogen. Fibroids often grow larger when estrogenlevels are high, as in pregnancy . Medications that lower\nthe estrogen level can cause the fibroids to shrink.KEY TERMS\nDetrusor muscle —Bladder muscle.\nUrethra —Passageway that carries urine from the\nbladder.The signs and symptoms of fibroids include:\n• Heavy uterine bleeding. This is the most common symp-\ntom, occurring in 30% of women who have fibroids.The excess bleeding usually happens during the men-strual period. Flow may be heavier, and periods may lastlonger. Women who have submucous or intramuralfibroids are most likely to have heavy uterine bleeding. \n• Pelvic pressure and pain . Large fibroids that press on\nnearby structures such as the bladder and bowel cancause pressure and pain. Larger fibroids tend to causeworse symptoms. \n•Infertility . This is a rare symptom of fibroids. It proba-\nbly accounts for less than 3% of infertility cases.Fibroids can cause infertility by compressing the uter-ine cavity. Submucous fibroids can fill the uterine cavi-ty and interfere with implantation of the fertilized egg. \n• Miscarriage. This is also an unusual symptom of\nfibroids, probably accounting for only a tiny fraction ofthe miscarriages that occur. \n• Pregnancy complications. Fibroids can greatly increase\nin size during pregnancy, because of increased levels ofestrogen. They can cause pain, and even lead to prema-\nture labor .\nDiagnosis\nA health care provider can usually feel fibroids dur-\ning a routine pelvic examination. Ultrasound can be usedto confirm the diagnosis, but this is not necessary.\nTreatment\nNot all fibroids cause symptoms. Even fibroids that\ndo cause symptoms may not require treatment. In themajority of cases, the symptoms are inconvenient andunpleasant, but do not result in health problems.\nOccasionally, fibroids lead to such heavy menstrual\nbleeding that the woman becomes severely anemic. Inthese cases, treatment of the fibroids may be necessary.Very large fibroids are much harder to treat. Therefore,many doctors recommend treatment for moderately-sized fibroids, in the hopes of preventing them fromgrowing into large fibroids that cause worse symptoms. \nThe following are possible treatment plans:\n• Observation. This is the most common plan. Most\nwomen already have symptoms at the time theirfibroids are discovered, but feel that they can toleratetheir symptoms. Therefore, no active treatment is given,but the woman and her physician stay alert for signsthat the condition might be getting worse. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3458Uterine fibroids•Hysterectomy . This involves surgical removal of the\nuterus, and it is the only real cure for fibroids. In fact,25% of hysterectomies are performed because ofsymptomatic fibroids. By the time a woman has a hys-terectomy for fibroids, she has usually endured severalyears of worsening symptoms. That’s because fibroidstend to grow over time. A gynecologist can remove afibroid uterus during either an abdominal or a vaginalhysterectomy. The choice depends on the size of thefibroids and other factors such as previous births andprevious surgeries. \n•Myomectomy . In this surgical procedure only the\nfibroids are removed; the uterus is repaired and left inplace. This is the surgical procedure many women chooseif they are not finished with childbearing. At first glance,it seems that this treatment is a middle ground betweenobservation and hysterectomy. However, myomectomy isactually a difficult surgical procedure, more difficult thana hysterectomy. Myomectomy often causes significantblood loss, and blood transfusions may be required. Inaddition, some fibroids are so large, or buried so deeplywithin the wall of the uterus, that it is not possible to savethe uterus, and a hysterectomy must be done, even though\nit was not planned. There are exceptions to this, however.Sometimes, fibroids grow on a stalk (pedunculatedfibroids), and these are easy to remove. \n• Medical treatment. Since fibroids are dependent on\nestrogen for their growth, medical treatments that lowerestrogen levels can cause fibroids to shrink. A group ofmedications known as GnRH antagonists can dramati-cally lower estrogen levels. Women who take thesemedications for three to six months find that theirfibroids shrink in size by 50% or more. They usuallyexperience dramatic relief of their symptoms of heavybleeding and pelvic pain.\nUnfortunately, GnRH antagonists cause unpleasant\nside effects in over 90% of women. The therapy is usual-ly used for only three months, and should not be used formore than six months because the risk of developing brit-tle bones ( osteoporosis ) begins to rise. Once the treat-\nment is stopped, the fibroids begin to grow back to theiroriginal size. Within six months, most of the old symp-toms return. Therefore, GnRH antagonists cannot beused as long-term solution. At the moment, treatment\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3459Uterine fibroids\nFallopian tubes\nOvary\nUterus\nCervixFibroids\n(benign tumors)\nVagina\nUterine fibroids are benign growths of uterine muscle and are very common.They are divided into three types, depending on\nthe location. Submucous fibroids are found in the uterine cavity; intramural fibroids grow on the wall of the uterus; and sub-serous fibroids are located outside of the uterus. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)with GnRH antagonists is used mainly in preparation for\nsurgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy). Shrinking thesize of the fibroids makes surgery much easier, andreducing the heavy bleeding allows a woman to build upher blood count before surgery. \nFibroids can cause problems during pregnancy because\nthey often grow in size. Large fibroids can cause pain andlead to premature labor. Fibroids cannot be removed duringpregnancy because of the risk of injury to the uterus andhemorrhage. GnRH antagonists cannot be used during preg-nancy. Treatment is limited to pain medication and medica-tion to prevent premature labor, if necessary.\nPrognosis\nMany women who have fibroids have no symptoms or\nhave only minor symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding orpelvic pressure. However, fibroids tend to grow over time,and gradually cause more symptoms. Many women ulti-mately decide to have some form of treatment.

    "title": "Uveitis",
    "content": "Uveitis\nDefinition\nUveitis is an inflammation of the uveal tract, which\nlines the inside of the eye behind the cornea. Much of theuvea lies between the retina and tough, outer sclera. Theuveal tract has three parts: the iris, the ciliary body, andthe choroid. Uveitis is categorized according to the part ofthe uveal tract that is affected. Anterior uveitis is aninflammation of the front part of the uveal tract; itincludes inflammation of the iris (iritis) and inflammationof the iris and the ciliary body (iridocyclitis). Posterioruveitis is an inflammation of the part of the uveal tractbehind the lens of the eye. It includes inflammation of thechoroid (choroiditis) and inflammation of the choroid andretina (chorioretinitis). Uveitis that affects the entire uvealtract is called panuveitis or diffuse uveitis.\nDescription\nThe uveal tract is made up of the iris, ciliary body,\nand choroid. The iris is the colored part of the eye. Theciliary body is inside the eye and produces a fluid calledaqueous humor. Ciliary muscles aid in accommodation,the process of changing the shape of the lens in the eye tosee things at various distances. The choroid lines theback of the eye and has many blood vessels. It helpsnourish part of the retina. The choroid lies between theretina and outermost sclera.\nUveitis may either persist for a long time (chronic)\nor have a short-term duration (acute). Anterior uveitis isclassified as either granulomatous or nongranulomatous.The distinction is based on the disease agents that wereconsidered responsible for the condition. At one time, itwas thought that granulomatous uveitis was caused bytuberculosis bacilli whereas nongranulomatous uveitis\nwas thought to be caused by streptococci. The distinctionis still used even though the causes of uveitis are nowunderstood differently.\nIn most cases, uveitis affects only one eye, although\nposterior uveitis sometimes involves both eyes. About60% of cases develop within the eye itself, but 40% are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3460Uveitisassociated with systemic diseases or disorders ranging\nfrom toxoplasmosis to syphilis . Many of these are dis-\neases of childhood and adolescence. Uveitis does notappear to run in families or to be associated with lifestylechoices, occupational history, geographical location, orenvironmental factors.\nUveitis is a serious condition that may develop\nrapidly and cause lasting damage to the eye. Patients whothink they may have chronic uveitis should seek evalua-tion and treatment by an ophthalmologist (a physicianwho specializes in diseases of the eye) as soon as possi-ble. If the patient has a sudden loss of vision and the eyelooks inflamed, the patient should go immediately to the\ndoctor for emergency treatment.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of uveitis are not fully understood, but\nthey can be a result of trauma, allergy, or a response to asystemic or ocular disease. Uveitis may be a type ofimmune-response mechanism. In people with impairedimmune systems, uveitis may be due to an infection.\nChronic uveitis is often associated with systemic\ndisorders (e.g., Lyme disease ,sarcoidosis , or juvenile\nrheumatoid arthritis ).\nAnterior uveitis\nThe so-called classic symptoms of anterior uveitis—\nsevere pain ; redness, particularly around the edge of the\niris; and extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia)—occur mostly in acute uveitis. In anterior uveitis, the doc-tor will see a so-called “flare and cell” pattern whenlooking into the watery fluid (aqueous humor) betweenthe cornea and the lens of the patient’s eye. The iris mayadhere to the lens, thus increasing the intraocular pres-sure. There may be nodules on the iris. There may betearing and the pupil may be constricted and nonreactive.In severe cases of anterior uveitis, there may be hypopy-on (a small amount of pus or collection of white cells)visible when the doctor examines the eye. \nGRANULOMATOUS UVEITIS. In granulomatous uveitis,\nthere will be large yellowish-white cells visible on the backof the cornea, and possibly some small nodules on the iris.Granulomatous uveitis is usually less acute than the non-granulomatous form; the eye is only mildly inflamed andthe patient’s vision is somewhat blurred.\nGranulomatous uveitis can be produced by syphilis,\ntoxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, sarcoidosis, tuberculo-sis, or V ogt-Koyonagi-Harada syndrome (VKH). VKH ismarked by severe uveitis associated with hair loss, hear-\ning loss , loss of pigment in the eyelashes and brows, and\nheadaches. It occurs most commonly in Asians.NONGRANULOMATOUS UVEITIS. In nongranulo-\nmatous uveitis, the cells visible on the cornea are small-er, and there are no masses on the iris. This type ofanterior uveitis is, however, more painful. The eye isred and the patient experiences both photophobia andloss of vision.\nSystemic diseases that can cause nongranulomatous\nuveitis include ankylosing spondylitis ,Reiter’s syn-\ndrome ,psoriasis ,ulcerative colitis ,Behcet’s syn-\ndrome , Lyme disease, and Crohn’s disease . Children—\nespecially girls—with anterior uveitis should be screenedfor juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).\nPosterior uveitis\nThe symptoms of posterior uveitis are sometimes\nsubtle. The patient may notice blurred or hazy vision, orfloating black spots before the eyes. There may be painand photophobia. The iris may attach to the lens in theeye thus increasing intraocular pressure. \nPosterior uveitis may be acute or chronic. It is more\nlikely to involve both eyes. When the doctor examines theeye, cells may be seen in the vitreous humor, which is thenormally transparent gel that fills the eyeball behind thelens. There will be yellowish or dark areas of inflamma-tion on the choroid and the retina. The blood vessels inthe retina develop a sheath or covering of inflammatorytissue. In severe cases, the vitreous humor is so cloudythat the doctor cannot see the retina at the back of the eye.\nPARS PLANITIS. Pars planitis is an inflammation of\nthe pars plana, which is a part of the ciliary body. Parsplanitis usually occurs in older children or young adults,and can develop into posterior uveitis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3461Uveitis\nThis person has acute iritis, or inflammation of the iris. Symp-\ntoms include pain in the eye or forehead and reddening of themargin of the iris.Treatment requires total rest of the eye(dark glasses and atropine drops which paralyze the musclesof accommodation), accompanied by application of corticos-teroids. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)The diseases that cause granulomatous uveitis may\nalso cause posterior uveitis.\nDiagnosis\nThe eye doctor will examine the patient’s eyes with\na slit lamp in order to rule out conjunctivitis and certain\ntypes of glaucoma . The slit lamp is an instrument that\ncombines a binocular microscope with a special light.The slit lamp can shine a narrow beam of very brightlight into the eye and allow the doctor to examine thefront part of the eye in detail.

In addition, the size of thepupil is often small in uveitis whereas it is normal in con-junctivitis. In acute glaucoma, the patient has severe pain,the cornea of the eye is cloudy, and the pressure level ofthe fluid inside the eye is abnormally high; whereas inuveitis the pain is moderate, the cornea is clear, and thefluid pressure is normal or possibly lower or slightlyabove normal. The doctor may also use the slit lamp andanother lens to examine the back of the eye to get a goodlook at the retina and choroid. Other instruments, such asa hand-held ophthalmoscope or a binocular indirect oph-thalmoscope, can be used to examine the back of the eye.There should be no discomfort with these tests except ifthe patient is sensitive to the bright light.\nLaboratory testing\nLaboratory testing is used to rule out conjunctivitis\nin some patients. The doctor wipes the inside of thepatient’s eyelid with a swab in order to obtain a samplefor testing. Although blood tests are not necessary todiagnose uveitis by itself, they are used to diagnose thecause if the doctor suspects that toxoplasmosis or anothersystemic disease is responsible for the uveitis. \nTreatment\nUveitis is generally treated by an ophthalmologist\nbecause therapy requires topical and oral medications,however, some optometrists (O.D.) are state licensed to usetherapeutic medications. Other doctors may be involved intreating the underlying disease, if the patient has one, andin monitoring the patient’s responses to medications.\nAnterior uveitis is treated with corticosteroid drops;\nin severe cases, the patient may be given steroid injec-tions in the area of the eye or oral steroids. Atropine sul-fate drops may be given to dilate the patient’s pupil. Pos-terior uveitis is treated with systemic corticosteroids . It\nis usually not necessary to dilate the pupil.\nProlonged steroid use may increase intraocular pres-\nsure, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma. Steroid usehas also been connected to cataract formation. Patientsshould be monitored closely and frequently.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends upon the location of the\nuveitis, on whether it is chronic or acute, and on thepromptness of treatment. The prognosis for untreateduveitis is poor.

If treated promptly, ante-rior uveitis usually clears up in several days or weeks,but is likely to recur. Posterior uveitis usually results insome permanent loss or blurring of vision.\nPrevention\nPatients with anterior uveitis should be warned\nabout the possibility of recurrence and instructed aboutits symptoms, especially inflammation of the iris.

Vaccines are medicines that containweakened or dead bacteria or viruses. When a persontakes a vaccine, his or her immune system responds byproducing antibodies—substances that weaken or destroydisease-causing organisms. When the person is laterexposed to live bacteria or viruses of the same kind thatwere in the vaccine, the antibodies prevent those organ-isms from making the person sick. Vaccines usually alsostimulate the so-called cellular immune system as well. Inother words, the person becomes immune to the diseasethe organisms normally cause. The process of building upimmunity by taking a vaccine is called immunization.\nVaccines are used in several ways. Some, such as the\nrabies vaccine, are given only when a person is likely to\nhave been exposed to the virus that causes the disease—through a dog bite, for example. Others are given to trav-elers planning to visit countries where certain diseasesare common such as typhoid fever or yellow fever . Vac-\ncines such as the influenza vaccine, or “flu shot,” are\ngiven mainly to specific groups of people—older adultsand others who are at high risk of developing influenzaor its complications. Then, there are vaccines that aregiven to almost everyone, such as the ones that preventdiphtheria ,tetanus ,polio and measles .\nChildren routinely have a series of vaccinations that\nbegins at birth. Given according to a specific schedule,these vaccinations protect against hepatitis B , diphthe-\nria, tetanus, pertussis ( whooping cough ), measles,\nmumps ,rubella (German measles), varicella ( chicken-pox), polio, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae\ntype b (Hib disease, a major cause of spinal meningitis )\nand, in some states, hepatitis A . This series of vaccina-\ntions is recommended by the American Academy ofFamily Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics,and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention andis required in all states before children can enter school.All states will make exceptions for children who havemedical conditions such as cancer that prevent them\nfrom having vaccinations, and some states also will makeexceptions for children whose parents object for reli-gious or other reasons.\nDescription\nIn addition to those discussed above, vaccines are\navailable for preventing anthrax ,cholera , hepatitis A,\nJapanese encephalitis , meningococcal meningitis,\nplague , pneumococcal infection (meningitis, pneumonia ),\ntuberculosis , typhoid fever , and yellow fever. Most vac-\ncines are given as injections, but a few are given by mouth.\nSome vaccines are combined in one injection, such\nas the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or diphtheria-per-tussis-tetanus (DPT) combinations.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\nvaccine and may be different for different patients. Thehealthcare professional who gives the vaccine will decideon the proper dose.\nA vaccination health record will help parents and\nhealth care providers keep track of a child’s vaccinations.The record should be started when the child has his orher first vaccination and should be updated with eachadditional vaccination. While most physicians follow therecommended vaccination schedule, parents shouldunderstand that some flexibility is allowed. For example,vaccinations that are scheduled for age two months maybe given anytime between six to 10 weeks. When possi-V\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3465ble, follow the schedule. However, slight departures will\nnot prevent the child from developing immunity, as longas all the vaccinations are given at around the right times.The child’s physician is the best person to decide wheneach vaccination should be given.\nAnyone planning a trip to another country should\ncheck to find out what vaccinations are needed. Some vac-cinations must be given as much as 12 weeks before thetrip, so getting this information early is important. Manymajor hospitals and medical centers have travel clinics thatcan provide this information. The Traveler’s Health Sec-tion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alsohas information on vaccination requirements.\nPrecautions\nVaccines are not always effective, and there is no\nway to predict whether a vaccine will “take” in any par-ticular person. To be most effective, vaccination pro-grams depend on whole communities participating. Themore people who are vaccinated, the lower everyone’srisk of being exposed to a disease. Even people who donot develop immunity through vaccination are saferwhen their friends, neighbors, children, and coworkersare immunized.\nLike most medical procedures, vaccination has risks\nas well as substantial benefits. Anyone who takes a vac-cine should make that sure he or she is fully informedabout both the benefits and the risks. Any questions orconcerns should be discussed with a physician or other\nhealth care provider. The Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, located in Atlanta, Georgia, also is agood source of information.\nVaccines may cause problems for people with cer-\ntain allergies . For example, people who are allergic to\nthe antibiotics neomycin or polymyxin B should not\ntake rubella vaccine, measles vaccine, mumps vaccineor the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vac-cine. Anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction tobaker’s yeast should not take the hepatitis B vaccine.Patients who are allergic to antibiotics such as gentam-icin sulfate, streptomycin sulfate or other aminoglyco-\nsides should check with their physicians before taking\ninfluenza vaccine, as some influenza vaccines containsmall amounts of these drugs. Also, some vaccines,including those for influenza, measles and mumps, aregrown in the fluids of chick embryos and should not betaken by people who are allergic to eggs. In general,anyone who has had an unusual reactions to a vaccine inthe past should let his or her physician know before tak-ing the same kind of vaccine again. The physician alsoshould be told about any allergies to foods, medicines,preservatives, or other substances.\nPeople with certain other medical conditions should\nbe cautious about taking vaccines. Influenza vaccine, forexample, may reactivate Guillain-Barré syndrome\n(GBS) in people who have had it before.

Vaccines contain antigens (weakened or dead viruses, bacteria, and fungi that cause disease and\ninfection). When introduced into the body, the antigens stimulate the immune system response by instructing B cells to pro-duce antibodies, with assistance from T-cells. B.The antibodies are produced to fight the weakened or dead viruses in thevaccine. C.The antibodies “practice” on the weakened viruses, preparing the immune system to destroy real and strongerviruses in the future. D. When new antigens enter the body, white blood cells called macrophages engulf them, process theinformation contained in the antigens, and send it to the T-cells so that an immune system response can be mobilized.

    "content": "Vaginal pain\nDefinition\nPain in the vaginal canal is usually associated with\nan underlying medical and/or psychological condition.\nDescription\nVaginal pain is experienced usually during vaginal\nmanipulation or sexual intercourse. Approximately50–85% of the causes are due to organic (medical) condi-tions. However, it is typical for the medical condition tobe compounded by psychological issues such as depres-sion and problems associated with sexual identity. Theprimary entity concerns dyspareunia, a vaginal pain expe-rienced during sexual intercourse. The vagina has threephysiological functions: an outflow duct for menstrualdischarge, to receive the penis during sexual intercourse,and as the birthing canal. The overall prevalence for dys-pareunia is 20% (15% of women and 57% of men). A sig-nificant percentage of breast cancer and hysterectomy\npatients demonstrated sexual dysfunction .KEY TERMS\nLaproscopic surgery — A surgical procedure to\ncorrect or diagnose an underlying disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes can be categorized as organic, due to a\nmedical condition and/or psychological difficulties.Medical conditions can include chronic diseases, minorailments, breast cancer , and medications. Psychological\ncause can be related to physical or sexual abuse . Preg-\nnancy and hormonal changes (decreased estrogen) have\nsignificant negative impact on sexual activity, desire, andsatisfaction. Dyspareunia can be divided into three typesof pain: superficial, vaginal, and deep. Superficial pain isassociated with attempted penetration. This is usuallycaused by changes in anatomy, irritative condition, orvaginismus. Vaginal pain is associated with friction, indi-cating a problem with lubrication and /or arousal disor-ders. Deep pain is related to thrusting and is indicative ofpelvic disease or an inability for pelvic relaxation .\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis must be pursued with diligence and in\na comprehensive manner. A careful history and physical\nexamination is essential. Procedures that can be used\ninclude surgical investigation ( laparoscopy ) and treat-\nment of the underlying cause(s).\nTreatment\nTreatment is directed at diagnosing the underlying\ncondition, which can be medical and/or psychologicalcause(s). Treatment can include surgery, hormonal therapy(replacements), psychotherapy, and pain control protocols.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the primary cause. If\ntreatment is aggressively pursued and patient complianceis satisfactory the overall outcome is favorable.\nPrevention\nThere are no precise preventive measures since the\ncondition can result from normal aging and/or progres-\nsively worsening psychological disease.\nResources\nBOOKS\nRyan, Kenneth J., et al, eds.

    "title": "Vagotomy",
    "content": "Vagotomy\nDefinition\nVagotomy is the surgical cutting of the vagus nerve\nto reduce acid secretion in the stomach.\nPurpose\nThe vagus nerve splits into branches that go to dif-\nferent parts of the stomach. Stimulation from thesebranches causes the stomach to produce acid. Too muchstomach acid leads to ulcers that may eventually bleedand create an emergency situation.\nVagotomy is performed when acid production in the\nstomach can not be reduced by other means. It is usedwhen ulcers in the stomach and duodenum do notrespond to medication and changes in diet. It is an appro-priate surgery when there are ulcer complications, suchas obstruction of digestive flow, bleeding, or perforation.The frequency with which elective vagotomy is per-formed has decreased in the past 20 years as drugs havebecome increasingly effective in treating ulcers. Howev-er, the number of vagotomies performed in emergencysituations has remained about the same.\nVagotomy is often performed in conjunction with other\ngastrointestinal surgery, such as partial removal of the stom-ach (antrectomy or subtotal gastrectomy ). There are several\ntypes of vagotomies. Truncal vagotomy severs the trunk ofthe vagus nerve as it enters the abdomen. Parietal cell orproximal gastric vagotomy leaves the trunk intact, but sev-ers the branches that go to different parts of the stomach.\nPrecautions\nPatients who receive vagotomies are most often seen\nin emergency situations where bleeding and perforatedulcers make it necessary to act immediately. As with anymajor surgery, people who use alcohol excessively,smoke, are obese, and are very young or very old are athigher risks for complications. \nDescription\nVagotomy is performed under general anesthesia by\na surgeon in a hospital. The surgeon makes an incision inthe abdomen and locates the vagus nerve. Either thetrunk or the branches leading to the stomach are cut.Then the abdominal muscles are sewn back together, andthe skin is closed with sutures. \nOften, other gastrointestinal surgery is performed at\nthe same time as the vagotomy. Part of the stomach maybe removed, for instance. Vagotomy causes a decrease inperistalsis and a change in the emptying patterns of thestomach. To ease this, a pyloroplasty is often performed.\nThis procedure widens the outlet from the stomach to thesmall intestine.\nPreparation\nA gastroscopy and x rays of the gastrointestinal sys-\ntem are performed as diagnostic procedures to determinethe position and condition of the ulcer. Standard preoper-ative blood and urine tests are done. The patient shoulddiscuss with the anesthesiologist any medications or con-ditions that might affect the administration of anesthesia.\nAftercare\nPatients who have had a vagotomy stay in the hospi-\ntal for about seven days. For the first three or four days,nasogastric suctioning is required. A tube is insertedthrough the nose and into the stomach. The stomach con-tents are then suctioned out. Patients eat a clear liquiddiet until the gastrointestinal tract is functioning again.When patients return to a regular diet, spicy and acidicfood should be avoided.\nIt takes about six weeks to fully recover from the\nsurgery. The sutures that close the skin can be removed inseven to ten days. Patients are encouraged to move aroundsoon after the operation to prevent the formation of deepvein blood clots. Pain medication, stool softeners, and\nantibiotics may be prescribed following the operation.\nRisks\nAs with all surgery, excessive bleeding and infection\nare possible complications. In addition, the emptyingpatterns of the stomach are changed. This can lead todumping syndrome and diarrhea . Dumping syndrome is\na condition where shortly after eating, the patient experi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3470Vagotomyences palpitations , sweating, nausea, cramps, vomiting,\nand diarrhea.\nNormal results\nNormal recovery is expected for most patients. In\nabout 10% of those who have vagotomy without stomachremoval, ulcers recur. Two to three percent of patientswho have some portion of their stomach removed alsohave recurrent ulcers.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Stomach and Duodenum.” In Current Surgical Diagnosis and\nTreatment. 10th ed.

It is used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the con-dition of the heart and is sometimes done as a treatmentto correct abnormal heart rhythms or relieve chest pain .\nPurpose\nThe Valsalva maneuver is used with patients who\nhave suspected heart abnormalities, often in conjunctionwith echocardiography . The maneuver is based on the\nfact that when a patient forcibly exhales against a closednose and mouth while bearing down, as if having a bowelmovement, specific changes occur in blood pressure andthe rate and volume of blood returning to the heart. \nComparing the changes in a diseased heart to those\nexpected in a normal heart gives clues to the type andlocation of heart damage. In addition, when a doctor lis-tens to the chest with a stethoscope during the Valsalvamaneuver, characteristic heart sounds are heard. Varia-tions in these sounds can indicate the type of abnormalitypresent in the heart.\nThe Valsalva maneuver also corrects some rapid\nheartbeats originating in the atria. When the maneuver isdone correctly, blood pressure rises. This forces the heartKEY TERMS\nAtria —The heart has four chambers. The right and\nleft atria are at the top of the heart and receivereturning blood from the veins.

On rare occasions, the Valsalva maneuver can beused to diminish chest pain in patients with mild coro-nary disease.\nUnrelated to any evaluation of the heart, the Valsalva\nmaneuver is also taught to patients with multiple sclero-\nsiswho are unable to fully empty the bladder (flaccid\nbladder). It is sometimes used in sexual therapy to helpmen avoid premature ejaculation .\nPrecautions\nThe Valsalva maneuver should not be performed on\npatients who have severe coronary artery disease ,h a v e\nexperienced recent heart attack , or where there is a\nmoderate to severe reduction in blood volume.\nDescription\nWhen performed formally, the patient is asked to\nblow against an aneroid pressure measuring device(manometer) and maintain a pressure of 40 millimetersof mercury (mm Hg) for 30 seconds. Or, less formally,the patient may be asked to bear down, as if having abowel movement. During this 30 second period, arecording is made of the changes in blood pressure andmurmurs of the heart.\nPreparation\nThe patient may be connected to a heart monitor and\nechocardiograph or the physician may simply use astethoscope to monitor the heart. Sometimes anindwelling needle is inserted for accurate pressure mea-surements, depending on whether the procedure is beingdone for corrective or diagnostic purposes.\nAftercare\nWhen this procedure is done to regulate irregular\nheart rhythms, the patient usually remains on a heartmonitor to evaluate heartbeat.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3471Valsalva maneuverRisks\nThe patient may feel dizzy or faint during the proce-\ndure, but serious consequences are rare. There is a riskthat the Valsalva maneuver can cause blood clots todetach, bleeding, and abnormal rhythms originating inthe ventricle. It can also cause cardiac arrest. Conse-quently, the procedure is usually performed in a settingwhere emergency equipment is accessible.\nNormal results\nThere are four characteristic changes or phases in a\nnormal heart’s response to the Valsalva maneuver.

    "title": "Valvular heart disease",
    "content": "Valvular heart disease\nDefinition\nValvular heart disease refers to several disorders and\ndiseases of the heart valves, which are the tissue flapsthat regulate the flow of blood through the four chambersof the heart.\nDescription\nThe human heart consists of four chambers—two\nupper chambers (the atria) and two lower chambers (theventricles)—that are responsible for pumping blood. Theheart valves are like one-way doors, which open andclose with each beat of the heart, controlling the bloodflow from one chamber to the next. Each of these valvesis made up of a few thin folds of tissue. When function-ing correctly, they keep blood from flowing backwardsinto a chamber when closed.\nThe four valves function in the following manner:\n• The mitral valve is located between the left atrium and\nthe left ventricle. It is the only valve with two flaps, orcusps. • The tricuspid valve is located on the right side of the\nheart, between the right atrium and right ventricle. It ismade up of three cusps, each a different size. \n• The aortic valve is located on the left side of the heart\nand opens to allow blood to leave the heart from the leftventricle into the aorta, which is the main artery of thebody. It closes to prevent blood from flowing back intothe left ventricle. \n• The pulmonary valve is situated on the right side of the\nheart, between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.It allows blood to exit the heart and enter the lungs viathe pulmonary artery. It closes to prevent blood fromflowing back into the right ventricle.\nPatients with valvular heart disease have a malfunc-\ntion of one or more of these valves. There are severaltypes of valvular heart diseases with distinct symptomsand treatments. These are:\n• mitral valve prolapse (displacement) \n• mitral valve insufficiency (regurgitation) \n• mitral valve stenosis (narrowing) • aortic valve insufficiency \n• aortic valve stenosis \n• tricuspid valve insufficiency • tricuspid valve stenosis \n• pulmonic stenosis \n• pulmonic insufficiency\nCertain types of heart disease can lead to one of the\nspecific conditions listed above. These include rheumat-\nic fever and infective inflammation of the heart ( endo-\ncarditis ). Multivalvular heart disease refers to a condi-\ntion involving more than one of the heart valves. \nCauses and symptoms\nProblems with heart valves may occur as a result of\ninfection, degeneration, or congenital abnormality. Themost common infections are rheumatic fever and infec-\ntive endocarditis.\nRheumatic fever\nRheumatic fever is a condition that results from the\nbody’s immune response to certain types of streptococcalbacteria. It occurs rarely. When it does occur, it is mostoften in children who have had strep throat that was not\ncompletely treated. The symptoms of rheumatic feverinclude heart inflammation, uncontrolled movement oflimbs and face, arthritis that moves from joint to joint,shortness of breath , weakness, and either lumps under\nthe skin or raised red patches on the skin. The most com-mon valvular heart diseases to result from rheumatic fever\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3472Valvular heart diseaseare mitral stenosis, tricuspid stenosis, aortic insufficiency,\naortic stenosis, multivalvular involvement, and less com-monly, pulmonic stenosis. Chronic rheumatic heart dis-ease can result from one occurrence or from repeatedattacks. It is not as common as it once was in the UnitedStates, but still occurs frequently in developing countries.Infective endocarditis\nInfective endocarditis is an infection and inflamma-\ntion of the inner layer, or membrane, of heart tissue (endo-cardium).

Inparticular, dental surgery or any surgery involving themouth, bladder, prostate, or female pelvic organs increasesrisk for this infection. The disease may also occur in drugaddicts who inject their veins using unsterilized needles,even if they have normal heart valves. Symptoms of infec-tive endocarditis include fever, a new or changing heartmurmur, and abnormal loss of appetite or fatigue .\nThe use of appetite suppressants\nIn 1997 and early 1998, research was underway to\ndetermine if fen-phen, the abbreviation for a combinationof the two weight-loss drugs fenfluramine and phenter-mine, caused heart valve problems in some patients.Physicians were concerned that this drug combinationcould affect the heart valves because the drugs altermetabolism of serotonin in the body. Serotonin is a nat-ural substance found in the brain and intestines that canaffect blood vessels. Until the issue could be studiedmore, physicians recommended that patients taper off thedrugs, finally stopping them altogether. The drug’s man-ufacturer removed fenfluramine from the market untilfurther study was conducted.\nOther valvular heart disease\nThe mitral and aortic valves may also be affected by\ndeposits of calcium in the heart that occurs with aging .\nThis can lead to thickening and leakage of heart valves.Heart attacks can also damage the mitral valve structures.Additionally, certain connective tissue disorders canadversely affect the heart valves, for example, Marfan’ssyndrome and myxomatous degeneration.\nDiagnosis\nSpecific types of valvular heart disease are diagnosed\nusing electrocardiography (EKG), echocardiography ,\ncertain x-ray studies, and/or cardiac catheterization . An\nEKG provides a record of electrical changes in the heartmuscle during the heartbeat. Echocardiography usessound waves to make images of the heart. These imagescan show if there are any abnormalities of the heartvalves. Cardiac catheterization is a procedure in which asmall tube (called a catheter) is inserted into an artery andpassed into the heart. It is used to measure pressure in theheart and the amount of blood pumped by the heart.\nRheumatic fever\nRheumatic fever may be suspected when a recent\nthroat infection has occurred and other major or minorsymptoms appear, such as joint ache, abnormal EKG, ora blood test indicating heart inflammation. Heart mur-\nmurs may be detected from routine examination. \nInfective endocarditis\nA diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be\nobtained through patient history, EKG, ultrasound, orcardiac catheterization. Patients who have developed thedisease rapidly may report fever, fatigue, night sweats,chills, and joint inflammation. Those whose disease hasdeveloped more slowly will show signs of rapid heartrate, an enlarged spleen, various skin colors or spots, andheart murmur. The physician may order blood tests todetermine what is causing the infection.\nAppetite suppressants\nPeople with a history of using appetite suppressants\nmay be sent for EKGs or further testing if any of thesymptoms of valvular heart disease, such as swelling,considerable fatigue, or shortness of breath occur.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of specific valvular heart diseases will\nvary, depending on the valve involved and the extent ofdamage or malfunction. Some patients will not requiretreatment and many will be treated with medication.Sometimes, patients need surgery. If multivalvular dis-ease is suspected or involved, different valves may beevaluated during surgery on one of the affected valves. \nRheumatic fever\nPatients with rheumatic fever will be treated with\nantibiotics to eliminate streptococcal organisms that\nmay still remain in the heart. Patients may receive antibi-otics to prevent further infection, and inflammation maybe treated with aspirin or cortisone-like drugs.\nInfective endocarditis\nPhysicians will use the appropriate antibiotic or\nsome combination of antibiotics to treat infective endo-carditis, depending on the type of bacterium that causedthe disease. Severe cases of this disease may be correctedby valve replacement surgery.\nAppetite suppressants\nThe role of appetite suppressants (fen-phen) in\nvalvular heart disease has been under study. As of 1998,these drugs were voluntarily removed from the market.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for patients with valvular heart dis-\nease varies depending on the underlying cause, age and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3474Valvular heart diseasehealth of the patient, and the degree of valvular damage\nor involvement.\nRheumatic fever\nPatients with rheumatic heart disease face a lifetime\nof caution over contact with the same bacterium thatcaused the disease. Since it can cause inflammation ofone or more organs or joints, complications can occur.The inflammation of the heart may subside without sideeffects. Permanent scarring of one or more heart valves isa possibility and may require surgery to repair or replacedamaged valves. In severe cases, rheumatic fever canlead to death from heart failure .\nInfective endocarditis\nThe prognosis for patients with infective endocardi-\ntis depends on the underlying heart disease and resultingcomplications. If the disease further damages heartvalves, symptoms may occur for years after initial treat-ment. Sometimes, endocarditis can result in heart orrenal failure. If untreated, it can be fatal.\nAppetite suppressants\nAs of early 1998, prognosis for patients with valvu-\nlar heart disease resulting from the use of certain appetitesuppressants was still under study. Since it is believedthat different valves may be affected, treatment wouldmost likely follow a similar course as that for the specificvalvular disease. \nPrevention\nCertain measures can be taken to prevent some\nvalvular disease. However, once valvular heart diseasethat results from congenital abnormality occurs, it maynot be prevented. Steps can be taken to prevent furthercomplications. \nRheumatic fever\nThe best prevention for rheumatic fever is prompt\nand thorough treatment of any suspected streptococcalinfection, particularly strep throat in children. A physi-cian should check any sore throat with fever that per-\nsists for more than 24 hours. The physician will probablyorder a throat culture . Completion of the antibiotic\ntreatment even after symptoms diminish is important tobe certain the infection is eliminated. \nInfective endocarditis\nAnyone who was born with a defective hart valve,\nthose with artificial (prosthetic) valves, or those whoKEY TERMS\nCongenital —Used to describe a condition or\ndefect present at birth.\nStenosis —An abnormal valve condition which is\ncharacterized by tightening or narrowing of theopening.\nStreptococcal ( Streptococcus )—Streptococcus is\na bacterium that causes infection in people.

Most often, they appear as lumpy,winding vessels just below the surface of the skin. Thereare three types of veins, superficial veins that are justbeneath the surface of the skin, deep veins that are largeblood vessels found deep inside muscles, and perforatorveins that connect the superficial veins to the deep veins.The superficial veins are the blood vessels most oftenaffected by varicose veins and are the veins seen by eyewhen the varicose condition has developed. \nThe inside wall of veins have valves that open and\nclose in response to the blood flow. When the left ventri-cle of the heart pushes blood out into the aorta, it pro-duces the high pressure pulse of the heartbeat and pushesblood throughout the body. Between heartbeats, there is aperiod of low blood pressure. During the low pressureperiod, blood in the veins is affected by gravity and wantsto flow downward. The valves in the veins prevent thisfrom happening. Varicose veins start when one or morevalves fail to close. The blood pressure in that section ofvein increases, causing additional valves to fail. Thisallows blood to pool and stretch the veins, further weak-ening the walls of the veins. The walls of the affectedveins lose their elasticity in response to increased bloodpressure. As the vessels weaken, more and more valvesare unable to close properly. The veins become larger andwider over time and begin to appear as lumpy, windingchains underneath the skin. Varicose veins can develop inthe deep veins also. Varicose veins in the superficial veinsare called primary varicosities, while varicose veins in thedeep veins are called secondary varicosities.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe predisposing causes of varicose veins are multi-\nple, and lifestyle and hormonal factors play a role. Somefamilies seem to have a higher incidence of varicoseveins, indicating that there may be a genetic componentto this disease. Varicose veins are progressive; as onesection of the veins weakens, it causes increased pressureon adjacent sections of veins. These sections often devel-op varicosities. Varicose veins can appear followingpregnancy ,thrombophlebitis , congenital blood vesselweakness, or obesity , but is not limited to these condi-\ntions. Edema of the surrounding tissue, ankles, and\ncalves, is not usually a complication of primary (superfi-cial) varicose veins and, when seen, usually indicatesthat the deep veins may have varicosities or clots. \nVaricose veins are a common problem; approximate-\nly 15% of the adult population in the United States havevaricose veins. Women have a much higher incidence ofthis disease than men. The symptoms can include aching,pain , itchiness, or burning sensations, especially when\nstanding. In some cases, with chronically bad veins,there may be a brownish discoloration of the skin orulcers (open sores) near the ankles. A condition that isfrequently associated with varicose veins is spider-burstveins. Spider-burst veins are very small veins that areenlarged. They may be caused by back-pressure fromvaricose veins, but can be caused by other factors. Theyare frequently associated with pregnancy and there maybe hormonal factors associated with their development.They are primarily of cosmetic concern and do not pre-sent any medical concerns.\nDiagnosis\nVaricose veins can usually be seen. In cases where\nvaricose veins are suspected, but can not be seen, aphysician may frequently detect them by palpation(pressing with the fingers). X rays or ultrasound tests candetect varicose veins in the deep and perforator veins andrule out blood clots in the deep veins.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3476Varicose veins\nVaricose veins on a man’s leg. (Custom Medical Stock Photo.\nReproduced by permission.)Treatment\nThere is no cure for varicose veins. Treatment falls\ninto two classes; relief of symptoms and removal of theaffected veins. Symptom relief includes such measuresas wearing support stockings, which compress the veinsand hold them in place. This keeps the veins fromstretching and limits pain. Other measures are sittingdown, using a footstool when sitting, avoiding standingfor long periods of time, and raising the legs wheneverpossible. These measures work by reducing the bloodpressure in leg veins. Prolonged standing allows theblood to collect under high pressure in the varicose veins.Exercise such as walking, biking, and swimming, is ben-\neficial. When the legs are active, the leg muscles helppump the blood in the veins. This limits the amount ofblood that collects in the varicose veins and reducessome of the symptoms. These measures reduce symp-toms, but do not stop the disease. \nSurgery is used to remove varicose veins from the\nbody. It is recommended for varicose veins that are caus-ing pain or are very unsightly, and when hemorrhaging orrecurrent thrombosis appear. Surgery involves making anincision through the skin at both ends of the section ofvein being removed. A flexible wire is inserted throughone end and extended to the other. The wire is then with-KEY TERMS\nCongenital —Existing at or before birth; a condi-\ntion that developed while the fetus was in utero oras a consequence of the birth process. \nEdema —Swelling caused by a collection of fluid\nin a tissue or body cavity.\nHemorrhage —Bleeding from blood vessels.\nPalpation —The process of examining a patient by\ntouch.\ndrawn, pulling the vein out with it. This is called “strip-\nping” and is the most common method to remove super-ficial varicose veins. As long as the deeper veins are stillfunctioning properly, a person can live without some ofthe superficial veins. Because of this, stripped varicoseveins are not replaced.\nInjection therapy is an alternate therapy used to seal\nvaricose veins. This prevents blood from entering thesealed sections of the vein. The veins remain in the body,but no longer carry blood. This procedure can be per-formed on an out-patient basis and does not require anes-thesia. It is frequently used if people develop more vari-cose veins after surgery to remove the larger varicoseveins and to seal spider-burst veins for people concernedabout cosmetic appearance. Injection therapy is alsocalled sclerotherapy. At one time, a method of injectiontherapy was used that did not have a good success rate.Veins did not seal properly and blood clots formed. Mod-ern injection therapy is improved and has a much highersuccess rate.\nPrognosis\nUntreated varicose veins become increasingly large\nand more obvious with time. Surgical stripping of vari-cose veins is successful for most patients. Most do notdevelop new, large varicose veins following surgery.Surgery does not decrease a person’s tendency to developvaricose veins. Varicose veins may develop in other loca-tions after stripping. \nResources\nBOOKS\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V . Fuster, eds. The Heart.\n9th ed.

    "title": "Vasculitis",
    "content": "Vasculitis\nDefinition\nVasculitis refers to a varied group of disorders which\nall share a common underlying problem of inflammationof a blood vessel or blood vessels. The inflammation mayaffect any size blood vessel, anywhere in the body. It mayaffect either arteries and/or veins. The inflammation maybe focal, meaning that it affects a single location within avessel; or it may be widespread, with areas of inflamma-tion scattered throughout a particular organ or tissue, oreven affecting more than one organ system in the body.\nDescription\nInflammation is a process which occurs when the\nimmune system of the body responds to either an injury ora foreign invader (virus, bacteria, or fungi). The immunesystem response involves sending a variety of cells andchemicals to the area in question. Inflammation causesblood vessels in the area to leak, causing swelling. Theinflamed area becomes red, hot to the touch, and tender.\nAntibodies are immune cells which recognize and\nbind to specific markers (called antigens) on other cells(including bacteria and viruses). These antibody-antigencomplexes can then stimulate the immune system to senda variety of other cells and chemicals involved in inflam-mation to their specific location.\nSome researchers believe that the damaging process of\nvasculitis is kicked off by such antibody-antigen complex-es. These complexes are deposited along the walls of theblood vessels. The resulting inflow of immune cells andchemicals causes inflammation within the blood vessels.\nThe type of disease caused by vasculitis varies\ndepending on a number of factors:\n• the organ system or tissue in which the vasculitis occurs \n• the specific type of inflammatory response provoked • whether the affected vessels are veins (which bring\nblood to the heart) or arteries (which carry blood andoxygen from the heart to the organs and tissues) • the degree to which blood flow within the affected ves-\nsel is reduced\nCauses and symptoms\nSome types of vasculitis appear to be due to a type\nof allergic response to a specific substance (for example,a drug). Other types of vasculitis have no identifiable ini-tiating event. Furthermore, researchers have not beenable to consistently identify antibody-antigen complexesin all of the types of diseases caused by vasculitis. Thetypes of antigens responsible for the initial immuneresponse have often gone unidentified as well. Further-more, not all people with such complexes depositedalong the blood vessels go on to develop vasculitis. Someresearchers believe that, in addition to the presence ofimmune complexes, an individual must have some othercharacteristics which make him or her susceptible to vas-culitis. Many questions have yet to be answered to totallyexplain the development these diseases.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of vasculitis depend on the severity of the\ninflammation and the organ system or systems affected.Some types of vasculitis are so mild that the only symp-toms noted are small reddish-purple dots (called petechi-ae) on the skin due to tiny amounts of blood seeping outof leaky blood vessels. In more widespread types of vas-culitis, the patient may have general symptoms of illness,including fever , achy muscles and joints, decreased\nappetite, weight loss, and loss of energy. The organ sys-tems affected by vasculitis may include:\n• The skin. Rashes , bumps under the skin, petechiae,\nlarger reddish-purple circles (purpura), or bruising(ecchymoses) may appear. Areas of skin totallydeprived of blood flow, and therefore of oxygen, maydie, resulting in blackened areas of gangrene.\n• The joints. In addition to joint pain , the joints them-\nselves may become inflamed, resulting in arthritis.\n• Brain and nervous system. Inflammation of the blood\nvessels in the brain can cause headaches, changes inpersonality, confusion, and seizures. If an area of thebrain becomes totally deprived of oxygen, a stroke\noccurs. A stroke means that an area of brain tissue iseither severely injured or completely dead from lack ofoxygen. This may leave the individual with a perma-nent disability. If the vessels that lead to the eyes areaffected, vision may become seriously disturbed.Nerves in the arms and legs may result in painful tin-gling sensations, loss of feeling, and weakness.\n• Gastrointestinal system. Patients may have significant\nabdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea . If blood flow\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3478Vasculitisis completely cut off to an area of intestine, that part of\nthe intestine will die off. The liver may be affected.\n• Heart. This is an extremely serious type of vasculitis.\nThe arteries of the heart (coronary arteries) may devel-op weakened areas, called aneurysms. The heart muscleitself may become inflamed and enlarged. With oxygendeprivation of the heart muscle, the individual may suf-fer a heart attack.\n• Lungs. The patient may experience shortness of breath\nwith chest pain, and may cough up blood. There may be\nwheezing . \n• Kidney. Changes in the arteries of the kidney may\nresult in high blood pressure. The kidneys may becomeincreasingly unable to appropriately filter the blood,and kidney failure may occur.\nSpecific diseases\nMultiple types of disease are associated with vas-\nculitis. Many autoimmune diseases have vasculitis as oneof their complications. These include systemic lupus\nerythematosus ,rheumatoid arthritis ,scleroderma ,\nand polymyositis . Other types of diseases which have\nvasculitis as their major manifestations include:\n• Polyarteritis nodosa. This is an extremely serious, sys-\ntemic (affecting systems throughout the body) form ofvasculitis. Small and medium arteries are involved, andthe inflammation is so severe that the walls of the arteriesmay be destroyed. Any organ system, or multiple organsystems, may be affected. The most serious effectsinclude kidney failure, complications involving the heart,gastrointestinal problems, and high blood pressure.\n• Kawasaki’s disease is an acute disease which primarily\nstrikes young children. Fever and skin manifestationsoccur in all patients. While most patients recover com-pletely, a few patients suffer from vasculitis in theheart. This is frequently fatal.\n• Henoch-Schonlein purpura. While this frequently\noccurs in children, adults may also be affected. Thisdisease tends to affect the skin, joints, gastrointestinaltract, and kidneys.\n•Serum sickness occurs when an individual reacts to a\ncomponent of a drug, for example penicillin. Symp-toms of this are often confined to the skin, althoughfevers, joint pain, and swelling of lymph nodes mayalso occur.\n•Temporal arteritis (also called giant cell arteritis)\ntends to involve arteries which branch off the majorartery that leads to the head, called the carotid. Anartery which feeds tissues in the area of the temple (thetemporal artery) is often affected. Severe headaches arethe most classic symptom. Other symptoms include\nfatigue , loss of appetite and then weight, fever, heavy\nsweating, joint pain, and pain in the muscles of theneck, shoulders, and back. If the vasculitis includesarteries which supply the eye, serious visual distur-bance or even blindness may result.\n• Takayasu’s arteritis affects the aorta (the very large\nmain artery that exits the heart and receives all of theblood to be delivered throughout the body), and arterieswhich branch off of the aorta. Initial symptoms includefatigue, fever, sweating at night, joint pain, and loss ofappetite and weight. Every organ may be affected bythis disease. A common sign of this disease is theinability to feel the pulse in any of the usual locations(the pulse is the regular, rhythmic sensation one canfeel with a finger over an artery, for example in thewrist, which represents the beating of the heart and theregular flow of blood).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3479Vasculitis\nThis person’s legs are afflicted with leukocytoblastic vas-\nculitis, a condition in which a blood or lymph vesselbecomes inflamed.

The vas-culitis produced by this disease includes the formationof fibrous, scarring nodules called granulomas. Symp-toms include nose bleeds, ear infections, cough, short-ness of breath, and chest pain. There may be bleedingin the lungs, and a patient may cough up blood. Thekidneys, eyes, and skin are also frequently involved.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of any type of vasculitis involves demon-\nstrating the presence of a strong inflammatory process.Tests which reveal inflammation throughout the bodyinclude erythrocyte sedimentation rate , blood tests\nwhich may reveal anemia and increased white bloodcells, and tests to demonstrate the presence of immuneKEY TERMS\nAneurysm —A weakened area in the wall of a\nblood vessel which causes an outpouching orbulge.

An\nx-ray procedure, called angiography , involves injecting\ndye into a major artery, and then taking x-ray pictures toexamine the blood vessels, in order to demonstrate thepresence of inflammation of the vessel walls. Tissuesamples (biopsies) may be taken from affected organs todemonstrate inflammation.\nTreatment\nEven though there are many different types of vas-\nculitis, with many different symptoms based on the organsystem affected, treatments are essentially the same.They all involve trying to decrease the activity of theimmune system. Steroid medications (like prednisone)are usually the first types of drugs used. Steroids work byinterfering with the chemicals involved in the inflamma-tory process. More potent drugs for severe cases of vas-culitis have more serious side effects. These includedrugs like cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide worksby actually killing cells of the patient’s immune system. \nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for vasculitis is quite variable. Some\nmild forms of vasculitis, such as those brought on by reac-tions to medications, may resolve totally on their own andnot even require treatment. Temporal arteritis, serum sick-ness, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and Kawasaki’s diseaseusually have excellent prognoses, although when Kawasa-ki’s affects the heart, there is a high death rate. Other\ntypes of vasculitis were always fatal, prior to the availabili-ty of prednisone and cyclophosphamide, and continue tohave high rates of fatal complications. These include pol-yarteritis nodosa and Wegener’s granulomatosis.\nPrevention\nBecause so little is known about what causes a par-\nticular individual to develop vasculitis, there are noknown ways to prevent it.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

    "title": "Vasectomy",
    "content": "Vasectomy\nDefinition\nA vasectomy is a surgical procedure performed on\nmales in which the vas deferens (tubes that carry spermfrom the testicles to the seminal vesicles) are cut, tied,cauterized (burned or seared) or otherwise interrupted.The semen no longer contains sperm after the tubes arecut, so conception cannot occur. The testicles continue toproduce sperm, but they die and are absorbed by the body.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this operation is to provide reliable\ncontraception . Research indicates that the level of effec-\ntiveness is 99.6%. Vasectomy is the most reliable methodof contraception.\nDescription\nVasectomies are often performed in the doctor’s\noffice using a local anesthesia. The patient’s scrotumarea will be shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic solu-tion to reduce the chance of infection. A small incision ismade into the scrotum (the sac containing the testiclesthat produce the sperm). Each of the vas deferens (onefrom each testicle) is tied in two places with nonab-sorbable (permanent) sutures and the tube is severedbetween the ties. The ends may be cauterized (burned orseared) to decrease the chance that they will leak or growback together.\nSterility does not occur immediately after the proce-\ndure is finished. Men must use other methods of contra-ception until two consecutive semen analyses confirmthat there are no sperm present in the semen. This willtake four to six weeks or 15-20 ejaculations to clear all ofthe sperm from the tubes.“No scalpel” vasectomies are gaining popularity.\nInstead of an incision, a small puncture is made into thescrotum. The vas deferens are cut and sealed in a mannersimilar to that described above. No stitches are necessaryand the patient has less pain . Other advantages include\nless damage to the tissues, less bleeding, less risk ofinfection, and less discomfort after the procedure.\nIn some, cases vasectomies may be reversed. How-\never, this procedure should be considered permanent asthere is no guarantee of successful reversal.\nPreparation\nNo special physical preparation is required. The physi-\ncian will first assess the patient’s general health in order toidentify any potential problems that could occur. The doc-tor will then explain possible risks and side effects. Thepatient is asked to sign a consent form which indicates thathe understands the information he has received, and givesthe doctor permission to perform the operation.\nAftercare\nFollowing the surgery, ice packs are often applied\nto scrotum to decrease pain and swelling.

Mild over-the-counter pain medica-tion such as aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol)\nshould be able to control any discomfort.

These are easily treated if they do occur.Patients do not experience difficulty achieving an erec-tion, maintaining an erection, or ejaculating. There isno decrease in the production of the male hormone(testosterone), and sex drive and ability are not altered.Vasectomy is safer and less expensive than tubal liga-\ntion (sterilization of a female by cutting the fallopian\ntube to prevent conception).\nNormal results\nNormally, vasectomies are 99% successful in pre-\nventing conception.

    "title": "Vasodilators",
    "content": "Vasodilators\nDefinition\nVasodilators are medicines that act directly on mus-\ncles in blood vessel walls to make blood vessels widen(dilate).\nPurpose\nVasodilators are used to treat high blood pressure\n(hypertension ). By widening the arteries, these drugs\nallow blood to flow through more easily, reducing bloodpressure. Controlling high blood pressure is importantbecause the condition puts a burden on the heart and thearteries, which can lead to permanent damage over time.If untreated, high blood pressure increases the risk ofheart attacks, heart failure ,stroke , or kidney failure.\nVasodilators usually are prescribed with other types ofblood pressure drugs and rarely are used alone.\nDescription\nExamples of vasodilators are hydralazine (Apreso-\nline) and minoxidil (Loniten). The vasodilator hydralazine\nalso may be used to control high blood pressure in preg-nant women or to bring down extremely high blood pres-sure in emergency situations. In the forms used for treatinghigh blood pressure (tablets or injections), these drugs areavailable only with a physician’s prescription. A liquidform of minoxidil, used to promote hair growth in peoplewith certain kinds of baldness and is applied directly to thescalp, is sold without a prescription.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\nvasodilator. Check with the physician who prescribed the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3482Vasodilatorsdrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the\ncorrect dosage, and use the medicine only as directed.\nPhysicians usually prescribe vasodilators along with\nother blood pressure medicines. Taking each drug at thecorrect time is extremely important. Health care providerscan offer suggestions of ways to remember when to takeeach drug.\nPrecautions\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking a vasodila-\ntor is important, especially during the first few months.The physician will check to make sure the medicine isworking as it should and will watch for unwanted sideeffects. People who have high blood pressure often feelfine. But even when they feel well, patients should keepseeing their physicians and taking their medicine.\nVasodilators will not cure high blood pressure, but\nwill help control the condition. To avoid the serioushealth problems that high blood pressure can cause,patients may have to take medicine for the rest of theirlives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough.People with high blood pressure may also need to avoidcertain foods and keep their weight under control. Thehealth care professional who is treating the condition canoffer advice on what measures may be necessary.\nSome people feel dizzy or have headaches while\nusing this medicine. These problems are especially likelyto occur in older people, who are more sensitive thanyounger people to the medicine’s effects. Anyone whotakes these drugs should not drive, use machines, or doanything else that might be dangerous until they knowhow the drugs affect them.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or who\nare taking certain other medicines may have problems ifthey take vasodilators. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had an unusual reac-\ntion to a vasodilator in the past should let his or herphysician know before taking this type of drug again.The physician should also be told about any allergies to\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\nPREGNANCY. Several problems—from excess hair\ngrowth to blood abnormalities—have been reported inbabies whose mothers take this vasodilators during preg-\nnancy . In studies of laboratory animals, hydralazine\ncauses birth defects in mice and rabbits, but not in rats.\nThe effects of taking vasodilators during pregnancy havenot been specifically studied in humans. Women who arepregnant or who may become pregnant should check\nwith their physicians before using this medicine. Womenwho become pregnant while taking a vasodilator shouldtell their physicians right away.\nBREASTFEEDING. Women who are breastfeeding\ntheir babies or who plan to breastfeed should check withtheir physicians before using this medicine.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Using a vasodilator\nto lower blood pressure may worsen the problems thatresult from heart disease, blood vessel disease, or arecent heart attack or stroke. This medicine may also\nmake angina (chest pain ) worse. And in people with\npheochromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal medulla),\nvasodilators may make the tumor more active. Beforeusing a vasodilator, people with any of these medicalproblems should make sure their physicians are aware oftheir conditions.\nPeople with kidney disease should also check with\ntheir physicians before using a vasodilator. Side effectsmay be greater in these people because their kidneys areslow to clear the medicine from the body.\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking vasodilators\nwith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects. Do nottake any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine with a vasodilator unless it has beendiscussed with the physician who prescribed thevasodilator.\nSide effects\nSome side effects of vasodilators go away as the\nbody adjusts to the drug and do not need medical atten-tion unless they continue or they interfere with normalactivities. These include:\n• headache \n• nausea or vomiting • diarrhea • loss of appetite\nIn addition, minoxidil may cause a temporary\nincrease in hair growth, especially on the face, arms, andback. Patients who are bothered by this should checkwith their physicians.\nOther side effects of vasodilators should have med-\nical attention. Check with a physician immediately if afast or irregular heartbeat occurs. And if any of the fol-lowing problems occur, check with a physician as soonas possible:\n• chest pain \n• muscle pain \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3483Vasodilators• joint pain \n• pain, numbness, tingling or weakness in the hands or\nfeet \n• swollen feet or lower legs • swollen lymph nodes • bloating •fever and sore throat\n• general discomfort or feeling of illness • weakness • blisters on skin; skin rash or itching ; flushing or red-\nness of the skin\nAdditional side effects are possible. Anyone who\nhas unusual symptoms while taking a vasodilator shouldget in touch with his or her physician.\nInteractions\nVasodilators may interact with other medicines.\nWhen this happens, the effects of one or both of thedrugs may change or the chance of side effects may begreater. In addition, many prescription and nonprescrip-tion (over-the-counter) drugs may affect blood pressure.Do not take any other medicine without the approval ofthe physician who prescribed the vasodilator. In particu-\nlar, avoid using over-the-counter medicines for appetitecontrol, colds, cough , sinus problems, asthma , hay fever\nand other allergies, as these may increase blood pressure.At the other extreme, dangerously low blood pressuremay result when drugs such as the blood pressure medi-cine guanethidine (Ismelin) or nitrates, used to treat chestpain, are combined with vasodilators.\nNancy Ross-FlaniganKEY TERMS\nAdrenal gland —One of a pair of organs located\nnext to the kidneys.

Vegetari-\nans often report higher energy levels, better digestion, andmental clarity. Vegetarianism is an economical and easilyimplemented preventative practice as well.\nDescription\nThe term vegetarian was coined in 1847 by the\nfounders of the Vegetarian Society of Great Britain, butvegetarianism has been around as long as people have cre-ated diets . Some of the world’s oldest cultures advocate a\nvegetarian diet for health and religious purposes. In India,millions of Hindus are vegetarians because of their reli-gious beliefs. One of the ancient mythological works ofHinduism, the Mahabharata , states that, “Those who\ndesire to possess good memory, beauty, long life with per-fect health, and physical, moral and spiritual strength,should abstain from animal foods.” The yoga system of liv-\ning and health is vegetarian, because its dietary practicesare based on the belief that healthy food contains prana .\nPrana is the universal life energy, which yoga expertsbelieve is abundant in fresh fruits, grains, nuts and vegeta-bles, but absent in meat because meat has been killed.Yogis also believe that spiritual health is influenced by the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3484Vegetarianismpractice of ahimsa , or not harming living beings. The prin-\nciple of ahimsa (non-violence) appears in the Upanishads\n(Vedic literature) from c. 600–300 B.C. Taking of animal\nlife or human life under any circumstances is sinful andresults in rebirth as a lower organism. It became a funda-mental element of Jainism, another religion of India. SomeBuddhists in Japan and China are also vegetarian becauseof spiritual beliefs. In the Christian tradition, the TrappistMonks of the Catholic Church are vegetarian, and somevegetarians argue that there is evidence that Jesus and hisearly followers were vegetarian. Other traditional cultures,such as those in the Middle East and the Mediterraneanregions, have evolved diets that frequently consist of vege-tarian foods. The Mediterranean diet, which a Harvardstudy declared to be one of the world’s healthiest, is pri-marily, although not strictly, vegetarian.\nThe list of famous vegetarians forms an illustrious\ngroup. The ancient Greek philosophers, including Socrates,Plato, and Pythagoras, advocated vegetarianism. In moderntimes, the word to describe someone who likes to feast on\nfood and wine is “epicure,” but it is little known that Epicu-rus, the ancient philosopher, was himself a diligent vegetar-ian. Other famous vegetarians include Leonardo da Vinci,Sir Isaac Newton, Leo Tolstoy, Ralph Waldo Emerson, andHenry Thoreau. This century’s celebrated vegetariansinclude Gandhi, the physician Albert Schweitzer, writerGeorge Bernard Shaw, musician Paul McCartney, andchampion triathlete Dave Scott. Albert Einstein, althoughnot a strict vegetarian himself, stated that a vegetarian dietwould be an evolutionary step for the human race.\nVegetarianism in America received a lot of interest\nduring the last half of the nineteenth century and the begin-ning of the twentieth century, during periods of experimen-tation with diets and health practices. Vegetarianism hasalso been a religious practice for some Americans, includ-ing the Seventh-day Adventists, whose lacto-ovo vegetari-an diets have been studied for their health benefits. Vegetar-ianism has been steadily gaining acceptance as an alterna-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3485Vegetarianism\nDR. JOHN HARVEY KELLOGG (1852–1943)\nJohn Harvey Kellogg is known as the father of mod-\nern breakfast cereal. He was born in Tyrone Township,Michigan, on February 26, 1852, into a Seventh DayAdventist family. At age 12, he became an apprentice atthe Review and Herald Press, a publishing company runby the church. He attended school in Battle Creek, Michi-gan. He attended Bellevue Hospital Medical College inNew York where he received his medical degree in 1875.\nIn 1876, at the age of 24, Kellogg became an abdominalsurgeon and superintendent of the Western HealthReform Institute, which he renamed the Battle Creek San-itarium. There, he began applying his theories about nat-ural living to his medical practice. Himself a vegetarian,he first advocated a diet high in whole grains, fruits, nuts,and legumes. He later included all types of vegetables inthe diet. His controversial health regimen included morn-ing calisthenics, open-air sleeping, cleansing enemas,chewing food hundreds of times before swallowing, anddrinking plenty of water.\nIn the 1890s, Kellogg established a laboratory at\nthe sanitarium to develop more nutritious foods. Hisbrother, Will Keith Kellogg, joined in his research. In1895 they developed a breakfast cereal of wheat flakescalled Granose. The cereal quickly grew in popularityand was soon sold by mail order. This was followed byrice flakes and corn flakes. The brothers established theSanitas Food Company. But philosophical differencesled them to split into two companies. Will founded theW. K. Kellogg Company, which retained the rights tothe cereal products. John set up the Battle Creek FoodCompany, which produced coffee substitutes andsoymilk. John Kellogg also edited Good Health Maga-\nzine, which promoted vegetarianism, for 60 years. In\n1904, he published a book, The Miricle of Life . He con-\ntinued to promote his version of healthy living and radi-cal techniques until his death in 1943.\n(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)tive to the meat-and-potatoes bias of the traditional Ameri-\ncan diet. In 1997, Vegetarian Resource Group performed aRoper poll that showed that 13 million Americans, or 5%of the population, identified themselves as vegetarians.\nSeveral factors contribute to the interest in vegetari-\nanism in America. Outbreaks of food poisoning from\nmeat products, as well as increased concern over the addi-tives in meat such as hormones and antibiotics , have led\nsome people and professionals to question meat’s safety.There is also an increased awareness of the questionabletreatment of farm animals in factory farming. But thegrowing health consciousness of Americans is probablythe major reason for the surge in interest in vegetarianism.Nutrition experts have built up convincing evidence that\nthere are major problems with the conventional Americandiet, which is centered around meat products that are highin cholesterol and saturated fat and low in fiber. Heart dis-ease, cancer, and diabetes, which cause 68% of all deathsin America, are all believed to be influenced by this diet.Nutritionists have repeatedly shown in studies that ahealthy diet consists of plenty of fresh vegetables andfruits, complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, andfoods that are high in fiber and low in cholesterol and sat-urated fat. Vegetarianism, a diet that fulfills all these crite-ria, has become part of many healthy lifestyles. In alterna-tive medicine, vegetarianism is a cornerstone dietary ther-apy, used in Ayurvedic medicine ,detoxification treat-\nments, macrobiotics, the Ornish diet for heart disease, andin therapies for many chronic conditions.\nPreparations\nSome people, particularly those with severe or\nchronic conditions such as heart disease or cancer, maybe advised by a health practitioner to become vegetariansuddenly. For most people, nutritionists recommend thata vegetarian diet be adopted gradually, to allow people’sbodies and lifestyles time to adjust to new eating habitsand food intake.\nSome nutritionists have designed transition diets to\nhelp people become vegetarian in stages. Many Ameri-cans eat meat products at nearly every meal, and the firststage of a transition diet is to substitute just a few meals aweek with wholly vegetarian foods. Then, particular meatproducts can be slowly reduced and eliminated from thediet and replaced with vegetarian foods. Red meat can bereduced and then eliminated, followed by pork, poultry,and fish. For those wishing to become pure vegetarians orvegans, the final step would be to substitute eggs anddairy products with other nutrient-rich foods. Individualsshould be willing to experiment with transition diets, andshould have patience when learning how combine vege-tarianism with social activities such as dining out.The transition to vegetarianism can be smoother for\nthose who make informed choices with dietary prac-tices. Sound nutritional guidelines include decreasingthe intake of fat, increasing fiber, and emphasizingfresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains inthe diet while avoiding processed foods and sugar.Everyone can improve their health by becoming famil-iar with recommended dietary and nutritional practices,such as reading labels and understanding basic nutri-tional concepts such as daily requirements for calories,protein, fat, and nutrients. Would-be vegetarians canexperiment with meat substitutes, foods that are high inprotein and essential nutrients. Thanks to the growinginterest in vegetarianism, many meat substitutes arenow readily available. Tofu and tempeh are productsmade from soybeans that are high in protein, calcium,and other nutrients. There are “veggie-burgers” that canbe grilled like hamburgers, and vegetarian substitutesfor turkey and sausage with surprisingly authentic tex-tures and taste. There are many vegetarian cookbookson the market as well.\nPrecautions\nIn general, a well-planned vegetarian diet is healthy\nand safe. However, vegetarians, and particularly veganswho eat no animal products, need to be aware of particu-lar nutrients that may be lacking in non-animal diets.These are amino acids, vitamin B\n12, vitamin D, calcium,\niron, zinc, and essential fatty acids. Furthermore, preg-nant women, growing children, and those with healthconditions have higher requirements for these nutrients.\nVegetarians should be aware of getting complete\nprotein in their diets. A complete protein contains all of\nthe essential amino acids, which are the building blocksfor protein essential to the diet because the body cannotmake them. Meat and dairy products generally containcomplete proteins, but most vegetarian foods such asgrains and legumes contain incomplete proteins, lackingone or more of the essential amino acids. However, vege-tarians can easily overcome this by combining particularfoods in order to create complete proteins. For instance,beans are high in the amino acid lysine but low in trypto-phan and methionine, but rice is low in lysine and high intryptophan and methionine. Thus, combining rice andbeans makes a complete protein. In general, combininglegumes such as soy, lentils, beans, and peas with grainslike rice, wheat, or oats forms complete proteins. Eatingdairy products or nuts with grains also makes proteinscomplete. Oatmeal with milk on it is complete, as ispeanut butter on whole wheat bread. Proteins do not nec-essarily need to be combined in the same meal, but gen-erally within four hours.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3486VegetarianismGetting enough vitamin B12may be an issue for some\nvegetarians, particularly vegans, because meat and dairyproducts are the main sources. Vitamin supplements thatcontain vitamin B\n12are recommended. Spirulina, a nutri-\ntional supplement made from algae, is also a vegetariansource, as are fortified soy products and nutritional yeast.\nVitamin D can be obtained by vitamins , fortified\nfoods, and sunshine. Calcium can be obtained inenriched tofu, seeds, nuts, legumes, dairy products, anddark green vegetables including broccoli, kale, spinach,and collard greens. Iron is found in raisins, figs, legumes,tofu, whole grains (particularly whole wheat), potatoes,and dark green leafy vegetables. Iron is absorbed moreefficiently by the body when iron-containing foods areeaten with foods that contain vitamin C, such as fruits,tomatoes, and green vegetables. Zinc is abundant in nuts,pumpkin seeds, legumes, whole grains, and tofu. Forvegetarians who don’t eat fish, getting enough omega-3essential fatty acids may be an issue, and supplementssuch as flaxseed oil should be considered, as well as eat-ing walnuts and canola oil.\nVegetarians do not necessarily have healthier diets.\nSome studies have shown that some vegetarians consumelarge amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat. Eggs anddairy products contain cholesterol and saturated fat,while nuts, oils, and avocados are vegetable sources ofsaturated fat. To reap the full benefits of a vegetariandiet, vegetarians should be conscious of cholesterol andsaturated fat intake. Vegetarians may also consider buy-ing organic foods, which are grown without the use ofsynthetic chemicals, as another health precaution.\nResearch and general acceptance\nA vegetarian diet has many well-documented health\nbenefits. It has been shown that vegetarians have a higherlife expectancy, as much as several years, than those whoeat a meat-centered diet. The U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) has stated that data has shownvegetarians to have a strong or significant probabilityagainst contracting obesity, heart disease, lung cancer,colon cancer ,alcoholism , hypertension, diabetes, gall-\nstones, gout, kidney stones, and ulcers. However, theFDA also points out that vegetarians tend to have healthylifestyle habits, so other factors may contribute to theirincreased health besides diet alone.\nA vegetarian diet, as prescribed by Dr. Dean Ornish,\nhas been shown to improve heart disease and reverse theeffects of atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries. It\nshould be noted that Dr. Ornish’s diet was used in conjunc-tion with exercise ,stress reduction , and other holistic\nmethods. The Ornish diet is lacto-ovo vegetarian, becauseit allows the use of egg whites and non-fat dairy products.Vegetarians have a resource of statistics in their\nfavor when it comes to presenting persuasive argumentsin favor of their eating habits. Vegetarians claim that avegetarian diet is a major step in improving the health ofcitizens and the environment. Americans eat over 200 lbs(91 kg) of meat per person per year. The incidence ofheart disease, cancer diabetes, and other diseases hasincreased along with a dramatic increase in meat con-sumption during the past century. Many statistics showsignificantly smaller risks for vegetarians contractingcertain conditions. The risks of women getting breast\ncancer and men contracting prostrate cancer are nearly\nfour times as high for frequent meat eaters as for thosewho eat meat sparingly or not at all. For heart attacks,American men have a 50% risk of having one, but therisk drops down to 15% for lacto-ovo vegetarians and toonly 4% for vegans. For cancer, studies of populationsaround the world have implied that plant-based dietshave lower associated risks for certain types of cancer.\nVegetarians claim other reasons for adopting a meat-\nfree diet. One major concern is the amount of pesticidesand synthetic additives such as hormones that show up inmeat products. Chemicals tend to accumulate in the tis-sue of animals that are higher in the food chain, a processcalled bioaccumulation . Vegetarians, by not eating meat,\ncan avoid the exposure to these accumulated toxins,many of which are known to influence the developmentof cancer. One study showed that DDT, a cancer-causingpesticide, was present in significant levels in mother’smilk for 99% of American women, but only 8% of vege-tarian women had significant levels of the pesticide.Women who eat meat had 35 times higher levels of par-ticular pesticides than vegetarian women. The synthetichormones and antibiotics added to American cattle hasled some European countries to ban American beef alto-gether. The widespread use of antibiotics in livestock hasmade many infectious agents more resistant to them,making some diseases harder to treat.\nVegetarians resort to ethical and environmental argu-\nments as well when supporting their food choices. Muchof U.S. agriculture is dedicated to producing meat, whichis an expensive and resource-depleting practice. It hasbeen estimated that 1.3 billion people could be fed withthe grain that America uses to feed livestock, and starva-\ntion is a major problem in world health. Producing meat\nplaces a heavy burden on natural resources, as comparedto growing grain and vegetables. One acre of land cangrow approximately 40,000 lbs (18,000 kg) of potatoesor 250 lbs (113 kg) of beef, and it takes 50,000 gal(200,000 l) of water to produce 1 lb (0.45 kg) of Califor-nia beef but only 25 gal (100 l) of water to produce 1 lb(0.45 kg) of wheat. Half of all water used in America isfor livestock production. Vegetarians argue that the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3487VegetarianismAmerican consumption of beef may also be contributing\nto global warming, by the large amounts of fossil fuelsused in its production. The South American rainforest isbeing cleared to support American’s beef consumption,as the United States yearly imports 300 million lbs (136million kg) of meat from Central and South America.The production of meat has been estimated as causing upto 85% of the loss of topsoil of America’s farmlands.\nDespite the favorable statistics, vegetarianism does\nhave its opponents. The meat industry in America is a pow-erful organization that has spent millions of dollars overdecades advertising the benefits of eating meat. Vegetarianspoint out that life-long eating habits are difficult to changefor many people, despite research showing that vegetariandiets can provide the same nutrients as meat-centered diets.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAkers, Keith.

    "content": "Vegetative state\nDefinition\nA coma-like state characterized by open eyes and\nthe appearance of wakefulness is defined as vegetative.\nDescription\nThe vegetative state is a chronic or long-term condi-\ntion. This condition differs from a persistent vegetativestate (PVS, a state of coma that lacks both awareness and\nwakefulness) since patients have awakened from coma,but still have not regained awareness. In the vegetativestate patients can open their eyelids occasionally anddemonstrate sleep-wake cycles. They also completelylack cognitive function. The vegetative state is alsocalled coma vigil.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe vegetative state can be caused by:\n• cardiac arrest\n• prolonged and profound hypoglycemia (an abnormal\nand severe decrease in blood sugar)\n• carbon monoxide poisoning• head injury• brain hemorrhage• compression of the brainstem• tumors• bilateral hemispheric demyelination (a loss of nerve\ncells)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3488Vegetative state• injury of the brain following infections ( meningitis or\nencephalitis)\n• neurodegenerative diseases• anencephaly (an abnormality of the brain and skull)\n• diffuse nerve cell injury\nPatients in a vegetative state apparently have func-\ntioning of a special area in the brain called the reticularactivating system (RAS) responsible for sleep-wakecycles. The connections that integrate more complex abili-ties such as awareness are interrupted. Patients in the vege-tative state can open and close eyes spontaneously. Theymay appear to track or follow objects with their eyes.Patients may chew and swallow food placed in the mouth.The vegetative patient does not respond to sound, hunger,or pain . Patients cannot obey verbal commands and lack\nlocal motor responses. Additionally these patients cannottalk in comprehendible terms and they may become noisy,restless, and hypermobility. These patients are in a state orarousal but completely lack awareness.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of vegetative state depends on the primary\ncause of brain dysfunction. A comprehensive history andneurological examination, neuroimaging studies, andchemical analysis of the blood are essential. Additional-ly, special tests such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, is thefluid that bathes and nourishes the brain and spinal cord)analysis and electroencephalographic (EEG analyzes theelectrical activity within the brain) may be indicated toestablish a diagnosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment is directed to presenting symptoms and\npatient needs. Patients require constant monitoring andassistance with feeding, hydration hygiene, assistedmovement (to help prevent ulcers and blood clots in thelegs), and elimination of waste products.\nAlternative treatment\nThere is no known alternative treatment for vegeta-\ntive patients.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis is generally poor and the condition\ncan persist chronically.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention since this state can\noccur as a result of unavoidable situations such as anaccident, tumor, and bleeding or genetic abnormality.KEY TERMS\nCognitive — The ability (or lack of) to think, learn,\nand memorize.\nHypermobility — Increased movement of joints.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGoetz, Christopher G., et al, eds.

    "content": "Velopharyngeal insufficiency\nDefinition\nVelopharyngeal insufficiency is the improper clos-\ning of the velopharyngeal sphincter (soft palate muscle)during speech characterized by an acute nasal quality ofthe voice.\nDescription\nAt the back of the mouth is a circle of structures that\ninclude the tonsils, the tongue, and the palate. Duringspeech, this apparatus must close off the nose for properarticulation of the explosive consonants “p,” “b,” “g,” “t,”and “d.” If it does not close, there is a snort sound pro-duced through the nose. Improper function of this struc-ture also produces a nasal tone to the voice.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are three main causes for this defect:\n• Cleft palate is a congenital condition, producing a\ndefect in the palate that allows air to escape upwardduring speech. \n• If tonsil and adenoid surgery is done improperly,\nvelopharyngeal insufficiency may result. The occur-rence rate is approximately one in every 2,000-3,000tonsillectomies. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3489Velopharyngeal insufficiency• Nerve or muscle disease may paralyze the muscles that\noperate the velopharyngeal sphincter.\nThe primary symptom is the speech impediment.\nSome people develop a change in their speaking patternor a series of facial grimaces to try to overcome the diffi-culty. If the condition is acute, regurgitation through thenose may occur.\nDiagnosis\nExamination of the velopharyngeal sphincter through\nultrasound scans, fiber-optic nasopharyngoscopy, andvideofluoroscopy will reveal the extent of velopharyngealinsufficiency. Speech and velopharyngeal sphinctermovement are compared to make the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nVelopharyngeal insufficiency is treated with a com-\nbination of surgery and speech therapy. There are severalsurgical procedures that can be performed to correct thephysical malfunction. They include:\n• Pharyngeal flap procedure that moves the skin flap\nfrom the pharynx to the soft palate. \n• Palatal push-back that separates the hard and soft palate\nin order to lengthen the soft palate. \n• Pharyngoplasty that lengthens the soft palate by turning\nthe pharyngeal skin flaps. \n• Augmentation pharyngoplasty that inserts an implant\ninto the pharyngeal wall to enlarge it, thus narrowingthe velopharyngeal opening. \n• Velopharyngeal sphincter reconstruction.KEY TERMS\nAdenoids —Lymph glands just above the tonsils\nand the palate.\nCleft palate —Congenital defect marked by a split\nin the roof of the mouth.\nNasopharyngoscopy —A diagnostic procedure that\nexamines the nasal passageways and pharynx withan instrument outfitted with an optical system.\nPharynx —A canal located between the mouth\ncavity and the esophagus.\nTonsillectomy —Surgical removal of the tonsils.\nTonsils —Lymph glands in the throat, just behind\nthe back teeth.Prognosis\nThe combination of surgery to correct the insuffi-\nciency and speech therapy to retrain the voice successful-ly alleviate velopharyngeal insufficiency.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEnglish, Gerald M.

It is the standard procedure used to\ndetect this type of disorder. Venography can also be usedto distinguish blood clots from obstructions in the veins,to evaluate congenital vein problems, to see how the deepleg vein valves are working, and to identify a vein forarterial bypass grafting.\nPrecautions\nVenography is usually not performed in patients\nwith kidney (renal) problems.\nDescription\nVenography (also called phlebography, ascending\ncontrast phlebography, or contrast venography) is aninvasive diagnostic test that provides a constant image ofleg veins on a fluoroscope screen. Venography identifiesthe location, extent, and degree of attachment of theblood clots, and enables the condition of the deep legveins to be assessed. It is especially useful when there isa strong suspicion of deep vein thrombosis, but non-inva-sive tests have failed to identify the disease.\nVenography is the most accurate test for detecting\ndeep vein thrombosis. It is nearly 100% sensitive andspecific in making this diagnosis (pulmonary embolism\nis diagnosed in other ways). Accuracy is crucial sincedeep vein thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism, acondition that can be fatal.\nVenography is not used often, however, because it is\npainful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly highdose of radiation, and can cause complications. In about5% of cases, there are technical problems in conductingthe test. In addition, the test is less accurate in diagnosingproblems below the knee. Venography takes between 30-45 minutes and can be done in a physician’s office, a lab-oratory, or a hospital.During the procedure, the patient lies on a tilting x-\nray table. The area where the catheter will be insertedwill be shaved, if necessary, and cleaned. Sometimes alocal anesthetic is injected to numb the skin at the site ofthe insertion. Sometimes a small incision is required tomake a point for insertion. The catheter is inserted andthe contrast solution (or dye) is slowly injected. Injectionof the dye causes a warm, flushing feeling in the leg thatmay spread through the body. The contrast solution mayalso cause slight nausea. About 18% of patients experi-ence discomfort from the contrast solution.\nIn order to fill the deep venous system with dye, a\ntight band (or tourniquet) may be tied around the ankle ofthe foot the dye is injected into, or the lower extremitiesmay be tilted. The patient is asked to keep the leg still.The doctor also observes the movement of the solutionthrough the vein with a fluoroscope. At the same time, aseries of x rays are taken. When the test is finished, fluidis injected to clear the dye from the veins, the catheter is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3492Venographyremoved, and a bandage is applied over the site of the\ninjection.\nPreparation\nFasting or drinking only clear liquids is necessary\nfor four hours before the test. However, sometimes thetest done in an emergency even if the patient has eaten.The contrast solution contains iodine, to which somepeople are allergic. Patients who have allergies or hay\nfever , or have had a bad reaction to a contrast solution,\nshould tell their doctor. A sedative, such as diazepam(Valium), may be prescribed to help the patient relax.\nAftercare\nPatients should drink large amounts of fluids to flush\nthe remaining contrast solution from their bodies. The areaaround the incision will be sore for a few days. If there isswelling, redness, pain, or fever, the doctor should be noti-\nfied. Pain medication may be needed. In most cases, thepatient can resume normal activities the next day.\nRisks\nVenography can also cause complications such as\nphlebitis, tissue damage, and the formation of deep veinthrombosis in a healthy leg. A rare side effect in up to 8%of cases is a severe allergic reaction to the dye. This usu-ally happens within 30 minutes after injection of the dyeand requires medical attention.\nNormal results\nNormal venography results show proper blood flow\nthrough the leg veins.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal venography results show well-defined\nfilling defects in veins. Findings include:\n• blood clots • consistent filling defects \n• an abrupt end of a test dye column \n• major deep veins that are unfilled • dye flow that is diverted\nThese results confirm a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis\nResources\nBOOKS\nDeBakey, Michael E., and Antonio M.

    "content": "Venous access\nDefinition\nVenous access introduces a needle into a vein, usual-\nly for the purpose of withdrawing blood or administeringmedication.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3493Venous accessPurpose\nVenous access is necessary for fluid administration,\nmedication administration, and obtaining blood forchemical analysis. Sites for access include veins locatedin the peripheral arms or legs, scalp, neck, and bone.\nVenous access in children may pose special problems\nsince finding appropriate veins and immobilization may\nbe difficult but essential. For complicated proceduressedation may be indicated. Venous access can be per-\nformed during emergency situations, for outpatients, inpa-tients, and those who require long term chemotherapy .\nPrecautions\nThere are no major precautions for access during\nemergency procedures. The main concern during an emer-gency would be to secure a portal of entry to infuse poten-tially life saving medications and fluids. For all methodsof access the main precautionary measures include atten-tion to accurate procedures. Proper procedures are neces-sary to minimize the possibility of infection, embolism ,\nphlebitis, or destruction of neighboring tissue.\nDescription\nFor peripheral venipuncture the common site is usu-\nally a vein in the arm (the anticubital fossa located on theopposite side of the elbow) or on the flat bony area of thehand (dorsum of the hand). Scalp veins are accessible ininfants under one year of age. The selected vein should belong and straight for needle accommodation. It should beidentified by straightness, lack of pulsation (characteristicof an artery), and filling with blood form above (arteriesfill from below). Internal jugular catheterization is per-formed in the neck using special bone and muscle land-marks. The external jugular vein can be cannulized byimmobilizing tilted and rotating the head. The subclavianapproach is a complicated procedure and emergencyaccess can be performed if attempts for access a vein inother areas have failed. Intraosseous venous access is usu-ally accomplished through a leg bone. Catheters implant-ed in the front of the chest (anterior chest wall) canaccomplish long-term venous access. A large leg vein ispreferably used and isolated by dissection. A catheter isinserted into the vein and they are tied together.\nPreparation\nFor peripheral vein access in the arm, a tourniquet is\napplied a few inches over the puncture site. The skin overthe puncture site is sterilized with an alcohol pad. Theneedle is inserted and either blood is drawn and the nee-dle is removed, or a catheter is inserted to place an intra-venous line. Scalp veins can be accessible by immobiliz-\ning the head, shaving the area from hair, and using a rub-ber band as a tourniquet. Internal jugular vein catheteri-zation is accomplished by extending the patient’s headover the edge of a table or cart and rotating away fromthe intended puncture site. Immobilizing the head andextending it 15–20 degrees over the edge of a bed or cartand rotating away from the puncture site can cannalizethe external jugular vein. The subclavian vein access is acomplicated procedure and requires sedation and specialpositioning (Trendelenburg). A towel should be place inthe back of the area. The skin should be cleansed and thepuncture site is anesthetized. For the femoral approachthe leg is externally rotated. The artery should be felt andalong with specific anatomical landmarks the vein can belocalized. The skin should be cleaned and anesthetized.During venous cutdown a large vein near the ankleboneis careful dissected away from underlying tissues. Thearea must be properly cleaned and anaesthetize prior tomaking an incision. A catheter is inserted and secured inplace with sutures.\nAftercare\nFor simple procedures such as peripheral venous\naccess, applying simple pressure (to stop bleeding) and abandage may be sufficient. For more complicated proce-dures, the primary cause for access should be treated aswell as care to avoid or treat potential complications thatmay arise from access.\nRisks\nFor access into a peripheral vein, care must be taken\nnot to puncture both sides of the vein. After removal ofthe needle or catheter, a piece of cotton and pressureshould be applied over the puncture site to preventunwanted bleeding. Access with a scalp vein should bepreformed with care to avoid hematoma formation (local-ized blood clot), accidental puncture of an artery, or infec-tion. Access into the internal jugular vein in the neck cancause laceration of an artery or nerve. This procedure canalso cause hematoma (blood clot) formation; damage tolocal nerves within the area, pneumothorax , or mis-\nplaced catheterization. Venous access into the externaljugular vein can cause hematoma or placement outsidethe thorax. Subclavian vein access can cause air to enter avein (resulting in an air embolus) or pneumothorax. Can-nulation of the femoral vein in the groin area can causeinfection or thrombophlebitis . Intraosseous venous\naccess commonly performed in a leg bone can causehematomas, infection or damage to bone marrow.

Venous insufficiency is a chronic(long term) condition. The number of new and existingcases is dependent on age and gender. Some patients mayhave a positive family history. Usually older persons andfemales are more commonly affected. Deep situated andsuperficial veins can be affected. Cancer obstructing veins\nin the pelvis area can cause superficial venous insufficien-cy. Deep venous insufficiency is commonly caused bythrombophlebitis , causing obstruction of valves that reg-\nulate blood flow in veins.

These re-canalized\nveins are inadequate and cannot correct the impairment offlow. However, larger veins may still remain occluded.When a thrombosis occurs the valves that regulate venousblood flow become thickened and incompetent, renderingthem incapable of regulating back flow of blood. Thisvalvular incompetence will cause an increase in the pres-ence within veins (venous hypertension ). Venous hyper-\ntension is responsible for most of the symptoms associatedwith venous disease. Superficial veins can become dilatedcausing varicose veins (veins that bulge and seem tortu-\nous). Leg ulcers can be severe and are responsible for100,000 cases of disability in the United States alone.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency can\nbe subjective and objective. Subjective symptomsinclude throbbing, cramping, burning sensations, and legfatigue . Patients can also develop chronic leg ulcers that\nmay not heal. Varicose veins in the legs can bleed (sinceveins are delicate structures with thin walls) and causedeath. Patients often develop fluid retention ( edema ) in\nthe affected limb. Skin changes can occur and affectedareas can become thin, shiny, discolored (blue-purple),and atrophic. The skin usually becomes thick and tough.\nDiagnosis\nThere are several techniques used to diagnose\nvenous disease.

    "content": "Ventricular aneurysm\nDefinition\nVentricular aneurysm is a complication of a heart\nattack (myocardial infarction). It is a ballooning of a sec-\ntion of a blood vessel in the heart that first appears severaldays or weeks after an acute myocardial infarction.\nDescription\nA myocardial infarction occurs when a section of\nthe heart wall is deprived of blood and dies (undergoesKEY TERMS\nAtrophic — A wasting of cells and tissues.\nThrombophlebitis — Venous inflammation with\nformation of a thrombus.\nThrombus — A clot in the cardiovascular system\n(the system that circulates blood throughout thebody).necrosis, or tissue death , and scarring). The heart wall is\nmainly muscle. It has two ventricles, the right and leftventricles, which pump blood to and from the lungs, andto the body. When part of the heart muscle dies, pumpingpower from that part of the wall is lost. After a myocar-dial infarction, the part of the heart wall that did not diemust continue pumping blood and compensate for thedead muscle. \nVentricular aneurysm is one of the complications\nthat follow a myocardial infarction.\nAn aneurysm is the outward swelling, or ballooning,\nof a blood vessel at a weak spot in the wall of the bloodvessel. In the case of ventricular aneurysm, the aneurysmoccurs in the wall of the heart at the spot where the myocar-dial infarction occurred. A scar usually forms in the area ofthe dead muscle tissue, and may eventually calcify. Ventric-ular aneurysms generally do not rupture. The left ventricleis involved in most cases of ventricular aneurysm.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe principle symptom of a ventricular aneurysm is\ncardiac insufficiency, a condition in which not enoughblood is being pumped to the body. Ventricular aneurysm isusually found after a large infarction in the muscle wall of aventricle. Ventricular aneurysm is seldom seen immediate-ly after a myocardial infarction. It takes several days orweeks to several months to develop. Frequently, recurrentventricular irregular heartbeats ( arrhythmias ) and low car-\ndiac output result from the presence of a ventricularaneurysm. Blood clots (thrombi) may form on the insidewall of the aneurysm and produce systemic blood clots thatget stuck in a blood vessel (embolisms), which could leadto stroke or an ischemic leg (a usually painful condition in\nwhich lack of blood circulation leads to reduced function).\nDiagnosis\nA number of signs may indicate ventricular\naneurysm, including an abnormal precordial impulse inthe heartbeat, persistent elevation of the S-T segment ofan electrocardiogram, and a characteristic bulge seen onthe heart when x-rayed. The bulge is typically seen whenthe heart contracts, driving blood to the aorta, in the sys-tolic phase of the heartbeat. Echolocation ( echocardiog-\nraphy or ultrasound) can confirm the presence of an\naneurysm. Cardiac catheterization may be performed\nto determine the extent of the aneurysm and the status ofthe coronary arteries. Stethoscopic examination revealsabnormal heart sounds, especially those associated witha backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atri-um in systole or contraction beat (mitral regurgitation).This heart murmur is caused by the heart muscles nolonger being able to properly operate the mitral valve.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3496Ventricular aneurysmTreatment\nMost cases of ventricular aneurysm are treated by\nclose medical follow-up and limiting patient activity. Sur-gical removal of the aneurysm is an option when persis-tent left ventricular failure or arrhythmia occurs, and theaneurysm is large. Vasodilators ,diuretics , and digoxin\nare used to treat heart failure . Anticoagulant drugs are\nused to prevent the formation of blood clots. Antiar-\nrhythmic drugs are used to treat heart arrhythmias.\nPrognosis\nVentricular aneurysm occurs more frequently than is\ncommonly thought. Based on postmortem examination,ventricular aneurysm occurs in as many as 15% ofmyocardial infarction cases. Patients with a large ventric-ular aneurysm in the left ventricle have a reduced sur-vival rate. Many patients have mild symptoms which arenot life-threatening. The survival rate is dependent on thefunction of the left ventricle.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V . Fuster, eds. The Heart.\n9th ed.

V ADs\ncan replace the left ventricle (LV AD), the right ventricle(RV AD), or both ventricles (BIV AD). They are usedwhen the heart muscle is damaged and needs to rest inorder to heal or when blood flow from the heart is inade-quate. V ADs can also be used as a bridge in patientsawaiting heart transplantation or in patients who have\nrejected a transplanted heart.\nExamples of patients who might be candidates for a\nV AD are those who:\n• have suffered a massive heart attack• cannot be weaned from heart-lung bypass after treat-\nment with intravenous fluids, medications, and inser-tion of a balloon pump in the aorta\n• have an infection in the heart wall that does not respond\nto conventional treatment\n• are awaiting a heart transplant and are unresponsive to\ndrug therapy and intravenous fluids\n• are undergoing high-risk procedures to clear the block-\nages in a coronary artery\nAlthough one in five people suffer left side ventricular\nfailure, only a minority are candidates for V ADs.

Surgery to install a V AD is per-formed under general anesthesia in a hospital operatingroom. An incision is made in the chest, then catheters areinserted into the heart and the correct artery. The surgeon\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3497Ventricular assist devicesutures the catheters in place, then attaches tubing to\nconnect the catheters to the pump. The pump stays out-side the body. Once it is turned on, blood flows out of thediseased ventricle and into the pump, then is returned tothe correct blood vessel leaving the heart.\nPreparation\nBefore the operation the patient meets with an anes-\nthesiologist to determine any special conditions that willaffect the administration of anesthesia. Standard preoper-ative blood and urine studies are performed, and the heartis monitored both before and during the operation withan electrocardiograph. \nAftercare\nThe patient is monitored in intensive care, with fol-\nlow-up blood, urine, and neurological studies. Bloodthinning medications are given to prevent blood clotting.\nExcept for those patients awaiting a heart transplant,\npatients are slowly and gradually weaned from the V AD.Even when patients no longer need the V AD, they willrequire supportive drug therapy and/or a balloon pumpinserted in the aorta.\nRisks\nV AD insertion carries risks of severe complications.\nBleeding from surgery is common and occurs in as manyas 30-50% of patients. Other complications include thedevelopment of blood clots, partial paralysis of the\ndiaphragm, respiratory failure , kidney failure, failure of\nthe V AD, damage to the coronary blood vessels, stroke ,\nand infection.\nSometimes when the left ventricle is supported, the\nright ventricle begins to need assistance.

Thisbeat, also called a premature ventricular contraction(PVC), occurs before the beat triggered by the heart’snormal function.\nDescription\nVentricular ectopic beats are common and do not\nindicate a problem in people without heart disease. How-ever, if a person has aortic stenosis, heart failure , or a\nprevious heart attack , VEBs may be followed by ven-\ntricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which can lead to\nsudden death .\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough the origin of a VEB is well documented,\nthe exact cause or causes are not well understood. Somephysicians believe the beat is caused by a trigger of spe-cific origin, while other physicians believe the beat israndom. Occasional ventricular ectopic beats occur inhealthy people. If there is no evidence of heart disease,there is little or no danger to the individual.\nA single ventricular ectopic beat has very little effect\non the pumping ability of the heart and usually does notcause any symptoms.

Unless stopped, thesechaotic impulses are fatal.\nDescription\nWhen the ventricles begin to quiver, and do not\nemploy coordinated contractions, the heart is said to be fib-rillating. In this condition the ventricles cannot pump bloodfrom the heart. Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) is the worstkind of abnormal heart rhythm, and is a form of cardiacarrest. It involves the pumping of the lower chambers of theheart, while atrial fibrillation involves the upper chambers.\nCauses and symptoms\nVentricular fibrillation is often associated with acute\nischemic events ( ischemia involves the deprivation of\noxygenated blood to an area of tissue), and with chronicischemic heart disease. It is frequently seen immediatelyfollowing a heart attack . It may also develop during\nhypoxia, atrial fibrillation, or improper grounding ofelectrical devices. An extremely low level of potassiumin the blood can also cause ventricular fibrillation.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3499Ventricular fibrillationThe first, and usually the only, symptom of V-fib is\nsudden unconsciousness.\nDiagnosis\nWhen an individual suddenly collapses, the possibil-\nity of ventricular fibrillation should be considered imme-diately. A quick assessment usually shows no pulse orheartbeat. The diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation is con-firmed with an electrocardiogram.\nTreatment\nBasic life support with standard cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR ) must be started within a few min-\nutes, followed as soon as possible with cardioversion .\nCardioversion is an electric shock delivered to the heartto stop the fibrillating. Early defibrillation is the key to\nsurvival. If left untreated, irreversible brain damage, dueto lack of oxygen to the brain, occurs after about fiveminutes. After the heart resumes its normal rhythm, med-ications are given to help maintain the rhythm.\nPrognosis\nEarly and effective CPR may provide the time nec-\nessary for medical personnel to arrive with a defibrillator.If a defibrillator is able to promptly restore a normalrhythm, up to 25% of victims are able to leave the hospi-tal without evidence of brain damage.KEY TERMS\nAtrial fibrillation —A condition in which the\nupper chambers of the heart quiver instead of con-tracting effectively\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) —Using res-\ncue breathing and chest compressions to help a per-son whose breathing and heartbeat have stopped\nCardioversion —A electrical shock delivered to the\nheart to restore a normal rhythm\nElectrocardiogram —A visual representation of the\nheart beat\nHeart failure —A term used when the heart is\nunable to pump enough blood to supply the needsof the body\nHypoxia —Insufficient oxygen in the cells of the\nbody\nIschemic —Insufficient blood reaching the tissuesIf ventricular fibrillation occurs in the hospital in\nconjunction with a heart attack, defibrillation has a 95%success rate.

The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungsand the left ventricle pumps blood throughout the body.If there is a hole in the septum that separates the two ven-tricles, blood from the left ventricle can enter the rightventricle. This blood recycles through the lungs beforereturning to the left ventricle. This results in less oxy-genated blood reaching the body. If the hole is sufficient-ly large, the lack of oxygen being delivered to the body\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3500Ventricular septal defectcan cause severe problems, including heart failure and\nbreathlessness. Approximately 0.7% of all babies have acongenital heart defect. Of these, 20% have a ventricularseptal defect. \nCauses and symptoms\nCongenital heart defects are errors in the develop-\nment of the heart structure. They occur early in the life ofthe embryo. There is no known cause of congenital heartdefects. They can be associated with several diseases,such as German measles (rubella ) and Down syndrome .\nGenetics does not seem to play a role in ventricular septaldefect. People with a heart defect do not have anincreased chance of passing it on to their children. \nSymptoms result from a reduced amount of oxygen\ngoing to the body. Symptoms are proportional to thesize of the defect. They may appear at any time in thelife of the child. In cases where the hole in the septum isvery small, few or no symptoms may appear and thechild may develop normally. In cases where the ventric-ular septal defect is large, the newborn will shows signsof heavy breathing, sweating, and feeding difficulties.Children with this defect tire easily. Ventricular septaldefect can also result in stunted growth resulting frominsufficient oxygen being delivered to the growingKEY TERMS\nEchocardiogram —An image of the heart produced\nby an instrument that uses sound waves to createimage the heart.\nElectrocardiogram —A graph of the heart’s beating\naction. \nEndocarditis —An inflammation of the interior lin-\ning of the heart that is frequently caused by infec-tious agents.\nbody. Children with ventricular septal defect tend to\nsuffer more frequent colds and pneumonia , and have a\nhigher rate of inflammation and infection of the heart(endocarditis ).\nDiagnosis\nThe condition is first suspected based on observation\nof the child. The physician will listen to the heart with astethoscope (auscultation) to detect a heart murmur. Xrays, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiography\ncan all be used to evaluate ventricular septal defect. \nTreatment\nMost small holes close without treatment. Often, as\nthe child grows, the hole closes or becomes smaller. Ifthe hole is large or fails to close, the child is usuallytreated with drugs. Holes that persist and are causingproblems in development are corrected by open heartsurgery. Usually, surgery is performed after one year ofage, but before the child enters school. This allows timefor a trial of drug therapy, which could potentially elimi-nate the need for surgery. The operation is generally safe.\nPrognosis\nChildren with small septal defects tend to develop\nnormally and without any effect on their ability to partic-ipate in physical activities. Surgery allows children withlarger defects to live nearly normal lives. \nResources\nBOOKS\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V . Fuster, eds. The Heart.\n9th ed.

    "title": "Ventricular shunt",
    "content": "Ventricular shunt\nDefinition\nVentricular shunt is a surgical procedure in which a\ntube is placed in one of the fluid-filled chambers insidethe brain (ventricles). The fluid around the brain and thespinal column is called the cerebrospinal fluid. Wheninfection or disease causes an excess of this cere-brospinal fluid in the ventricles, the shunt is placed todrain it and thereby relieve excess pressure.\nPurpose\nVentricular shunt relieves hydrocephalus , a condi-\ntion in which the ventricles are enlarged. In hydro-cephalus, pressure from the cerebrospinal fluid usuallyincreases. It may be caused by tumor of the brain or ofthe membranes covering the brain (meninges), infectionof or bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid, or inborn mal-formations of the brain. Symptoms of hydrocephalusmay include headache , personality disturbances and loss\nof intellectual abilities ( dementia ), problems in walking,\nirritability, vomiting, abnormal eye movements, or a lowlevel of consciousness.\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus is associated with\nprogressive dementia, problems in walking, and loss ofbladder control ( urinary incontinence ). Even though\nthe cerebrospinal fluid is not thought to be underincreased pressure in this condition, it may also be treat-ed by ventricular shunting.\nPrecautions\nAs with any surgical procedure, the surgeon must\nknow about any medications or health problems that mayincrease the patient’s risk. Because infections are bothcommon and serious complications, antibiotics are often\ngiven before and after surgery.\nDescription\nThe ventricular shunt tube is placed to drain fluid\nfrom the ventricular system in the brain to the cavity ofthe abdomen or to the large vein in the neck (jugularvein). Therefore, surgical procedures must be done bothin the brain and at the drainage site. The tubing containsvalves to insure that fluid can only flow out of the brainand not back into it. The valve can be set at a desiredpressure to allow cerebrospinal fluid to escape wheneverthe pressure level is exceeded.\nA small reservoir may be attached to the tubing and\nplaced under the scalp. This reservoir allows samples ofcerebrospinal fluid to be removed with a syringe to checkthe pressure. Fluid from the reservoir can also be exam-ined for bacteria, cancer cells, blood, or protein, depend-\ning on the cause of hydrocephalus. The reservoir may alsobe used to inject antibiotics for cerebrospinal fluid infec-tion or chemotherapy medication for meningeal tumors.\nPreparation\nThe diagnosis of hydrocephalus should be confirmed\nby diagnostic techniques that make images of the brain,such as computed tomography scan (CT scan) or magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), before the shunting procedure\nis performed. These techniques will also show any associ-ated brain abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid should beexamined if infection or tumor of the meninges is suspect-ed. Patients with dementia or mental retardation should\nundergo neuropsychological testing to establish a baselinepsychological profile before the shunting procedure.\nPatients with normal pressure hydrocephalus may\nexperience a temporary improvement in walking andmental abilities upon removal of a moderate amount ofcerebrospinal fluid. This improvement may be an indica-tion that shunting will improve their condition. However,patients who do not improve after temporary cere-brospinal fluid drainage may still benefit from ventricu-lar shunt. When a case is in doubt, continuous monitor-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3502Ventricular shunting of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (which in itself\nrequires a surgical procedure) may indicate whethershunting is likely to be helpful.\nAftercare\nTo avoid infections at the shunt site, the area should\nbe kept clean. Cerebrospinal fluid should be checkedperiodically by the doctor to be sure there is no infectionor bleeding into the shunt. Cerebrospinal fluid pressureshould be checked to be sure the shunt is operating prop-erly. The eyes should be examined regularly becauseshunt failure may damage the nerve to the eyes (opticnerve). If not treated promptly, damage to the optic nervecauses irreversible loss of vision. Patients or caregiversshould understand the life-threatening nature of shuntproblems. All symptoms and signs of potential shunt fail-ure or infection must be taken seriously.\nRisks\nComplications of shunting occur in 30% of cases,\nbut only 5% are serious. Serious and long-term compli-cations are bleeding under the outermost covering of thebrain ( subdural hematoma ), infection, stroke , and\nshunt failure. Infection at the shunt site may cause a lossof intelligence. When shunts drain to the abdomen (ven-triculoperitoneal shunts), fluid may accumulate in theabdomen or abdominal organs may be injured. If cere-brospinal fluid pressure is lowered too much, patientsmay have severe headaches, often with nausea and vom-\niting , whenever they sit up or stand.\nNormal results\nOf patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus who\nare treated with shunting, 25-80% experience long-termimprovement. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is morelikely to improve when it is caused by infection of or bleed-ing into the cerebrospinal fluid than when it occurs withoutan underlying cause. Walking difficulties and bladder con-trol are more likely to improve than dementia is.\nAfter shunting, the ventricles get smaller within\nthree or four days. This shrinkage occurs even whenhydrocephalus has been present for a year or more. Clini-cally detectable signs of improvement occur within a fewweeks. The cause of hydrocephalus, duration of hydro-cephalus before shunting, and associated brain abnor-malities affect the outcome.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBlack, P.

    "title": "Ventricular tachycardia",
    "content": "Ventricular tachycardia\nDefinition\nVentricular tachycardia (V-tach) is a rapid heart beat\nthat originates in one of the lower chambers (the ventri-cles) of the heart. To be classified as tachycardia, theheart rate is usually at least 100 beats per minute.\nDescription\nA rapid heart rate can originate in either the left or\nright ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia which lasts morethan 30 seconds is referred to as sustained ventriculartachycardia. A period of three to five rapid beats is calleda salvo, and six beats or more lasting less than 30 secondsis called nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Rapid ven-tricular rhythms are more serious than rapid atrialrhythms because they make the heart extremely ineffi-cient. They also tend to cause more severe symptoms, andhave a much greater tendency to result in death .\nAlthough generally considered to be among the life-\nthreatening abnormal rhythms, harmless forms of sus-tained V-tach do exist. These occur in people without anystructural heart disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nMost ventricular tachycardias are associated with\nserious heart disease such as coronary artery blockage,cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease . V-tach is\noften triggered by an extra beat originating in either theright or left ventricle. It also occurs frequently in connec-tion with a heart attack . V-tach commonly occurs within\n24 hours of the start of the attack. It must be treated\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3503Ventricular tachycardiaquickly to prevent fibrillation. After 48 to 72 hours of the\nheart attack, the risk of ventricular tachycardia is small.However, people who have suffered severe damage to thelarger anterior wall of the heart have a second dangerperiod, because V-tach often occurs during convales-cence from this type of heart attack.\nSustained ventricular tachycardia prevents the ven-\ntricles from filling adequately so the heart can not pumpnormally. This results in loss of blood pressure, and canlead to a loss of consciousness and to heart failure .\nThe individual with V-tach almost always experi-\nences palpitation, though some episodes cause no symp-toms at all.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is easily made with an electrocardiogram.\nTreatment\nAny episode of ventricular tachycardia that causes\nsymptoms needs to be treated. An episode that lasts morethan 30 seconds, even without symptoms, also needs tobe treated. Drug therapy can be given intravenously tosuppress episodes of V-tach. If blood pressure falls belownormal, a person will need electric cardioversion\n(“shock”) immediately.\nPrognosis\nWith appropriate drug or surgical treatment, ventric-\nular tachycardia can be controlled in most people.KEY TERMS\nAtrial —Having to do with the upper chambers of\nthe heart.\nCardiomyopathy —A disease of the heart muscle.\nCardioversion —A electrical shock delivered to the\nheart to restore a normal rhythm.\nCoronary artery —The artery that supplies blood\nto the heart muscle itself.\nElectrocardiogram —A visual representation of the\nheart beat.\nFibrillation —Rapid, uncoordinated, quivering of\nthe heart.\nPalpitations —Uncomfortable feeling of the heart\nbeat in the chest.\nValvular —Having to do with the valves inside the\nheart.Prevention\nA person susceptible to sustained ventricular\ntachycardia often has a small abnormal area in the ven-tricles that is the source of the trigger event.

    "title": "Vesicoureteral reflux",
    "content": "Vesicoureteral reflux\nDefinition\nVesicoureteral reflux (VUR) refers to a condition in\nwhich urine flows from the bladder, back up the ureter,and back into the kidneys.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3504Vesicoureteral reflux\nAn electrocardiographic image indicating a rapid heart beat.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)Description\nThe normal flow of urine begins in the collecting\nsystem of each kidney. Urine then flows out of each kid-ney and into a tube called the ureter. Each ureter leadsinto the bladder, where the urine collects until it is passedout of the body. Normally, urine should flow only in thisdirection. In vesicoureteral reflux, however, urine thathas already collected in the bladder is able to flow back-wards from the bladder, up the ureter, and back into thecollecting system of the kidney. VUR may be present ineither one or both ureters.\nVesicoureteral reflux causes damage to the kidneys\nin two ways:\n• The kidney is not designed to withstand very much pres-\nsure. When VUR is present, backpressure of the urineon the kidney is significant. This can damage the kidney.\n• The kidney is usually sterile, meaning that no bacteria\nare normally present within it. In VUR, bacteria thatenter through the urinary tract may be carried back upthe ureter with the urine. These bacteria can enter thekidney, causing severe infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nMost cases of VUR are due to a defect in the way the\nureter is implanted into the bladder. The angle may bewrong, or the valve (which should allow urine only one-way entrance into the bladder) may be weak. Structuraldefects of the urinary system may also cause VUR.These include a situation in which two ureters leave akidney, instead of the usual one (duplicated ureters), andin which the ureter is greatly enlarged at the end leadinginto the bladder (ureterocele).\nVUR alone does not usually cause symptoms. Symp-\ntoms develop when an infection has set in. The usualsymptoms of infection include frequent need to urinate,pain or burning with urination, and blood or pus in the\nurine. Occasionally, VUR is suspected when a child has adifficult time becoming toilet trained. In these cases, thebladder may become irritable and spasm, because it isnever totally empty of urine. When the kidneys have beendamaged, high blood pressure may develop.\nDiagnosis\nVUR is diagnosed by taking a series of x-ray pic-\ntures. These are taken after putting a small tube (catheter)into the bladder. The bladder is then filled with a dyesolution which lights up on the x-ray picture. Pictures aretaken immediately, followed by x rays taken while thepatient is urinating. This will allow reflux to be demon-strated, and will reveal whether the level of reflux increas-es when pressure increases during urination. Reflux is\nthen graded based on the height and effects of the VUR:\n• Grade I. VUR enters just the portion of the ureter clos-\nest to the bladder. The ureter appears normal in size.\n• Grade II. VUR enters the entire ureter, and goes up into\nthe collecting system of the kidney. The ureter and thecollecting system appear normal in size and structure.\n• Grade III. VUR enters the entire ureter and kidney col-\nlecting system. Either the ureter or the collecting sys-tem are abnormal in size or shape. \n• Grade IV . Similar to Grade III, but the ureter is greatly\nenlarged. \n• Grade V . Similar to Grade IV , but the ureter is also abnor-\nmally twisted/curved, and the collecting system is great-ly enlarged, with absence of the usual structural details.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the grade that is diagnosed. In\ngrades I and II, the usual treatment involves long-termuse of a small daily dose of antibiotics to prevent the\ndevelopment of infections. The urine is tested regularlyto make sure that no infection occurs. The kidneys areevaluated regularly to make sure that they are growingnormally and that no new scarring has occurred. GradeIII VUR can be treated with antibiotics and careful moni-toring. New infections, scarring, or stunting of kidneygrowth may result in a need for surgery. Grades IV and Vare extremely likely to require surgery.\nSurgery for VUR consists of reimplanting the ureters\ninto the bladder at a more normal angle. This usuallyimproves the functioning of the valve leading into thebladder. When structural defects of the urinary systemare present, surgery will almost always be required torepair these defects.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis is dependent on the grade of VUR. About\n80% of children with grades I and II VUR simply growout of the problem. As they grow, the ureter lengthens,changing its angle of entry into the bladder. About 50%of children with grade III VUR will require surgery.Nearly all children with grades IV and V VUR willrequire surgery. In these cases, it is usually best to per-form surgery at a relatively young age, in order to avoiddamage and scarring to the kidneys.\nPrevention\nWhile there is no known method of preventing VUR,\nit is important to note that a high number of the siblings of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3505Vesicoureteral refluxchildren with VUR will also have VUR. Many of these sib-\nlings (about 36%) will have no symptoms, but will be dis-covered through routine examinations prompted by theirbrother’s or sister’s problems. It is important to identifythese children, so that antibiotic treatment can be used toprevent the development of infection and kidney damage.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFrancoeur, D., et al. “Urologic Problems.” In Pediatric and\nAdolescent Gynecology , ed.

Vibrio bacteria\ncause diarrhea , skin infections, and/or blood infections.\nThe diarrhea-causing Vibrio parahemolyticus is a rela-\ntively harmless infection, but Vibrio vulnificus infection,\nthough rare, can lead to blood poisoning and death in\nmany cases. \nDescription\nVibriosis is a general term referring to an infection\nby any member of the large group of Vibrio bacteria. The\nbacteria that causes cholera is in this group. Alternate\nnames include non-cholera Vibrio infection, Vibrio para-\nhemolyticus infection, and Vibrio vulnificus infection.\nVibrio parahemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are\nfound in salt water. Infection with either of these twobacteria primarily occurs through eating contaminatedraw seafood. Raw oysters are the usual source, althoughother seafood can carry the bacteria. \nVibrio parahemolyticus causes severe diarrhea. Vib-\nrio vulnificus may cause diarrhea, but in persons with an\nunderlying disease it may cause severe blood infections(septicemia or blood poisoning). Contact of a woundwith seawater or contaminated seafood can lead to a Vib-\nrio vulnificus skin infection. \nVibriosis is not very common in the United States.\nMost cases occur in coastal states between June and Octo-ber. Between 1988 and 1991, there were only 21 reportedcases of Vibrio parahemolyticus infection in the United\nStates. Between 1988 and 1995, there were over 300reports of Vibrio vulnificus infection in the United States.\nCauses and symptoms\nVibriosis is caused by eating seafood contaminated\nwith Vibrio parahemolyticus or Vibrio vulnificus . These\nbacteria damage the inner wall of the intestine, whichcauses diarrhea and related symptoms. Vibrio vulnificus\ncan get through the intestinal wall and into the blood-stream.\nPersons at risk for severe, often fatal vibriosis\ninclude those with liver disease ( cirrhosis ), excess iron\n(hemochromatosis ),thalassemia (a blood disorder),\nAIDS , diabetes, or those who are immunosuppressed. \nSymptoms of intestinal infection occur within two\ndays of eating contaminated seafood. Symptoms last for\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3506Vibriosistwo to 10 days and include watery diarrhea, abdominal\ncramps, nausea, vomiting, headache , and possibly fever .\nSymptoms of a blood infection develop one to two daysafter eating contaminated seafood, and include fever,chills, low blood pressure, and large fluid-filled blisterson the arms or legs. Similar blisters can also be producedby a Vibrio vulnificus skin infection.\nDiagnosis\nVibriosis can be diagnosed and treated by an infec-\ntious disease specialist. It is diagnosed when Vibrio bac-\nteria are grown from samples of stool, blood, or blisterfluid. The symptoms and a recent history of eating rawseafood are very important clues for diagnosis.\nTreatment\nTo counteract the fluid loss resulting from diarrhea,\nthe patient will receive fluids either by mouth or intra-venously. Antibiotics are not helpful in treating Vibrio\nparahemolyticus diarrhea. \nHowever, Vibrio vulnificus infections are treated\nwith antibiotics such as tetracycline (Sumycin,Achromycin V), or doxycycline (Monodox) plus cef-tazidime (Ceftaz, Fortraz, Tazicef). One out of fivepatients with vibriosis requires hospitalization.\nPrognosis\nMost healthy persons completely recover from diar-\nrhea caused by Vibrio bacteria. Vibrio vulnificus blood\ninfection affects persons with underlying illness and isfatal in half of those cases. Vibrio vulnificus wound\ninfections are fatal in one quarter of the cases.\nPrevention\nContamination with Vibrio bacteria does not change\nthe look, smell, or taste of the seafood. Vibriosis can beprevented by avoiding raw or undercooked shellfish,keeping raw shellfish and its juices away from cookedfoods, and avoiding contact of wounded skin with seawa-ter or raw seafood.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSack, David A. “Cholera and Related Illnesses Caused by Vib-\nrio Species and Aeromonas.” In Infectious Diseases ,e d .\nSherwood L.

    "title": "Vision training",
    "content": "Vision training\nDefinition\nVision training, also known as vision therapy or\northoptics, consists of a variety of programs to enhancevisual performance. It includes treatments for focusing,binocularity, and eye movement problems. Vision train-ing is generally provided by an optometrist (O.D.).\nPurpose\nWhile visual acuity refers to how clearly each eye\ncan see, vision training addresses how well the two eyeswork together as a team. When looking at an object, theeyes must focus on the object (e.g., focusing for near orfar objects). This involves the lens system of the eyes.The eyes must also work as a team and point at the sameobject so that the person does not see double. Aimingprecisely at the same object will aid in depth perception(stereopsis) and seeing objects in three-dimensions (3D).\nAlthough crossed eyes ( strabismus ) is an obvious\ncondition, many defects in the coordination of eye move-ment are far less apparent. Even so, they can cause prob-lems in reading, driving vehicles, and other complex tasksthat require the integrated function of eyes and body. It isthe goal of vision therapy to improve these subtle interac-tions using carefully devised exercises and devices.\nThe discipline, called “behavioral optometry,”\ninvolves a careful evaluation of visual function, concen-trating on complex skills such as rapid reading, distanceperception, peripheral field awareness, accommodativefacility, and the coordinated movement of each eye inrelationship to the other. From that assessment the doctorgoes on to design a course of exercises to correct theproblems discovered. Like any other type of training,success requires practice and persistence until habits andreflexes can be retrained.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3507Vision trainingThere are a number of different techniques and\ninstruments used in vision therapy; the field is evolvingrapidly in many directions. Some computerized exercisesare being developed that promise better patient motiva-tion. A device called the Dynavision apparatus, has pro-duced positive results in retraining stroke victims to\noperate motor vehicles. And traditional forms of visiontherapy have increased reading efficiency in an older agegroup (62 to 75 years).\nBecause the goal of vision training is to improve\nvisual efficiency and visual processing, people havingproblems reading should consider a vision training evalu-ation. Children rubbing their eyes while reading, avoid-ing reading, or getting headaches while reading shouldbe evaluated. Problems with sustaining focusing (accom-modative insufficiency) or problems keeping words sin-gle (convergence or divergence problems) may be pre-sent. A full eye-health evaluation and vision trainingworkup may reveal a problem. Vision training is alsoappropriate for people learning how to coordinate theeyes after surgery for strabismus. Vision training can alsobe used in lazy eye ( amblyopia ) and includes patching\nthe eye and doing various exercises.\nDyslexia is a problem with following the flow of\nwords when reading. Often the order of letters or wordsis reversed. It is a complex problem involving the waythe brain processes the stream of information coming infrom the eyes. While vision therapy is not a treatment fordyslexia or learning disabilities, there may be an under-lying visual processing problem that may be present.Vision therapy can be part of a multidisciplinaryapproach to treating learning disabilities.\nSports vision deals with visual performance in sport-\nrelated activities. Protective eyewear is also a large con-sideration when participating in sports. Basketball, base-ball, racquetball, and swimming (and other sports aswell) can all cause injury to the eyes. Batting helmetswith face shields, protective goggles with polycarbonatelenses, or something as simple as ultraviolet (UV) coat-ings on glasses to protect the eyes from the sun in out-door sports such as golf can protect the eyes. Hitting abaseball or throwing a basketball into a hoop requiresaccurate fixation. Golfers need to see clearly and judgedistance. Bifocals may need to be adjusted to allow forputting, driving, and reading the score card. While manyof these issues (e.g., UV coatings) can be addressed at aregular eye exam, sports vision may be able to help withmore specific, individual problems.\nPrecautions\nBehavioral optometry is a relatively new field of\nstudy. Results are mixed. Newer techniques, more refinedevaluation methods, and newer pieces of apparatus are\ncontinuously being appraised. More study results areneeded to define the scope and benefits of this discipline. \nDescription\nVision therapy is individually tailored to the subject\nand the discovered problems. It can be a lengthy processwith many variations that requires repetition until eyemuscles, coordination, reflexes, habits, and the way thebrain handles visual input are all retrained. Each programwill be individualized. The patient should be aware of thetime involved for treatment. Treatment can be from sev-eral weeks to several months depending upon the condi-tion. Some insurance plans may cover vision training.\nPreparation\nIf vision therapy is recommended, the optometrist\nwill discuss thoroughly what is expected and necessaryfor success. The patient must be prepared to performsome eye exercises at home.\nAftercare\nEven after the treatment is successful, it may be nec-\nessary to continue the exercises to maintain the benefits.It may be necessary to repeat treatment in the future.\nRisks\nNo risk is involved. The treatment is safe.\nNormal results\nA carefully and individually tailored program of\nvision therapy should result in a gradual improvement inwhatever complex visual function is being addressed.This progress ought to be measurable by using the sametests that were used to diagnose it.

    "title": "Visual impairment",
    "content": "Visual impairment\nDefinition\nTotal blindness is the inability to tell light from dark,\nor the total inability to see. Visual impairment or lowvision is a severe reduction in vision that can’t be cor-rected with standard glasses or contact lenses andreduces a person’s ability to function at certain or alltasks. Legal blindness (which is actually a severe visualimpairment) refers to a best-corrected central vision of20/200 or worse in the better eye or a visual acuity ofbetter than 20/200 but with a visual field no greater than20° (e.g., side vision that is so reduced that it appears asif the person is looking through a tunnel). \nDescription\nVision is normally measured using a Snellen chart.\nA Snellen chart has letters of different sizes that are read,one eye at a time, from a distance of 20 ft. People withnormal vision are able to read the 20 ft line at 20 ft—20/20 vision—or the 40 ft line at 40 ft, the 100 ft line at100 ft, and so forth. If at 20 ft the smallest readable letteris larger, vision is designated as the distance from thechart over the size of the smallest letter that can be read. \nEye care professionals measure vision in many ways.\nClarity (sharpness) of vision indicates how well a per-son’s central visual status is. The diopter is the unit ofmeasure for refractive errors such as nearsightedness, far-sightedness, and astigmatism and indicates the strength\nof corrective lenses needed. People do not just see straightahead; the entire area of vision is called the visual field.Some people have good vision (e.g., see clearly) but haveareas of reduced or no vision (blind spots) in parts of theirvisual field. Others have good vision in the center butpoor vision around the edges (peripheral visual field).People with very poor vision may be able only to countfingers at a given distance from their eyes. This distancebecomes the measure of their ability to see.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines\nimpaired vision in five categories:\n• Low vision 1 is a best corrected visual acuity of 20/70. • Low vision 2 starts at 20/200. \n• Blindness 3 is below 20/400. \n• Blindness 4 is worse than 5/300 \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3509Visual impairment• Blindness 5 is no light perception at all.\n• A visual field between 5° and 10° (compared with a\nnormal visual field of about 120°) goes into category 3;less than 5° into category 4, even if the tiny spot of cen-tral vision is perfect.\nColor blindness is the reduced ability to perceive\ncertain colors, usually red and green. It is a hereditarydefect and affects very few tasks. Contrast sensitivitydescribes the ability to distinguish one object fromanother. A person with reduced contrast sensitivity mayhave problems seeing things in the fog because of thedecrease in contrast between the object and the fog. \nAccording to the WHO there are over forty million\npeople worldwide whose vision is category 3 or worse, 80%of whom live in developing countries. Half of the blind pop-ulation in the United States is over 65 years of age.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe leading causes of blindness include:\n•macular degeneration\n•glaucoma\n•cataracts\n• diabetes mellitus\nOther possible causes include infections, injury, or\nnutrition .\nInfections\nMost infectious eye diseases have been eliminated in\nthe industrialized nations by sanitation, medication, andpublic health measures. Viral infections are the mainexception to this statement. Some infections that maylead to visual impairment include:\n• Herpes simplex keratitis . A viral infection of the cornea.\nRepeated occurrences may lead to corneal scarring. \n•Trachoma . This disease is responsible for six to nine\nmillion cases of blindness around the world, of the thirdof a billion who have the disease. Trachoma is causedby an incomplete bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis ,\nthat is easily treated with standard antibiotics . It is\ntransmitted directly from eye to eye, mostly by flies.The chlamydia gradually destroy the cornea. \n• Leprosy (Hansen’s disease). This is another bacterial\ndisease that has a high affinity for the eyes. It, too, canbe effectively treated with medicines. \n• River blindness. Much of the tropics of the Eastern\nHemisphere are infested with Onchocerca volvulus ,a\nworm that causes “river blindness.” This worm is trans-mitted by fly bites and can be treated with a drug calledivermectin. Nevertheless, twenty-eight million people\nhave the disease, and 40% of them are blind from it.\nOther causes\nExposure of a pregnant woman to certain diseases\n(e.g., rubella or toxoplasmosis ) can cause congenital\neye problems. Injuries to the eyes can result in blindness.Very little blindness is due to disease in the brain or theoptic nerves. Multiple sclerosis and similar nervous sys-\ntem diseases, brain tumors, diseases of the eye sockets,and head injuries are rare causes of blindness.\nNutrition\nVitamin A deficiency is a widespread cause of\ncorneal degeneration in children in developing nations.As many as five million children develop xerophthalmiafrom this deficiency each year. Five percent end up blind.\nDiagnosis\nA low vision exam is slightly different from a gener-\nal exam. While a case history, visual status, and eyehealth evaluation are common to both exams, somethings do differ. Eye charts other than a Snellen eye chartwill be used. Testing distance will vary. A trial frameworn by the patient is usually used instead of the instru-ment containing the lenses the patient sits behind(phoropter). Because the low vision exam is slightlymore goal oriented than a general exam, for example,what specifically is the patient having trouble with (read-ing, seeing street signs, etc.) different optical and nonop-tical aids will generally be tried. Eye health is the lastthing to be checked so that the lights necessary to exam-ine the eyes won’t interfere with the rest of the testing.\nTreatment\nThere are many options for patients with visual\nimpairment. There are optical and nonoptical aids. Opti-cal aids include:\n• Telescopes. May be used to read street signs. \n• Hand magnifiers. May be used to read labels on things\nat the store. \n• Stand magnifiers. May be used to read. \n• Prisms. May be used to move the image onto a healthy\npart of the retina in some eye diseases. \n• Closed circuit television (CCTV). For large magnifica-\ntion (e.g., for reading).\nNonoptical aids can include large print books and\nmagazines, check-writing guides, large print dials on thetelephone, and more.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3510Visual impairmentFor those who are blind, there are enormous\nresources available to improve the quality of life. For thelegally blind, financial assistance for help may be possi-ble. Braille and audio books are increasingly available.Guide dogs provide well-trained eyes and independence.Orientation and mobility training is available. There arespecial schools for blind children and access to disabilitysupport through Social Security and private institutions.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis generally relates to the severity of the\nimpairment and the ability of the aids to correct it. Agood low vision exam is important to be aware of the lat-est low vision aids. \nPrevention\nRegular eye exams are important to detect silent eye\nproblems (e.g., glaucoma). Left untreated, glaucoma canresult in blindness.\nCorneal infections can be treated with effective\nantibiotics. When a cornea has become opaque beyondrecovery it must be transplanted. Good hygiene (e.g.,washing hands frequently) to prevent infection, properuse of contact lenses, and not sharing makeup are justsome ways to guard against corneal infections. \nCataracts should be removed when they interfere\nwith a person’s quality of life.\nPrimary prevention addresses the causes before they\never begin. Fly control can be accomplished by simplesanitation methods. Public health measures can reducethe incidence of many infectious diseases. Vitamin Asupplementation (when appropriate) will eliminatexerophthalmia completely. It is possible that protectingthe eyes against ultraviolet (UV) light will reduce theincidence of cataracts, macular degeneration, and someother eye diseases. UV coatings can be placed on regularglasses, sunglasses, and ski goggles. Patients should asktheir eye care professional about UV coatings. Protectivegoggles should also be worn in certain situations (e.g.,certain jobs, sports, even mowing the lawn).\nSecondary prevention addresses treating established\ndiseases before they cause irreversible eye damage. Hav-ing general physical checkups can also detect systemicdiseases such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Controlof diabetes is very important in preserving sight. \nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J.

Beta-carotene is a form of pre-vitaminA, which is readily converted to vitamin A in the body.Night blindness is the first symptom of vitamin A defi-ciency. Prolonged and severe vitamin A deficiency canproduce total and irreversible blindness.\nDescription\nVitamin A (called retinol in mammals) is a fat-solu-\nble vitamin. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA)for vitamin A is 1.0 mg/day for the adult man and 0.8mg/day for the adult woman. Since beta-carotene is con-verted to vitamin A in the body, the body’s requirementfor vitamin A can be supplied entirely by beta-carotene.Six mg of beta-carotene are considered to be the equiva-lent of 1 mg of vitamin A. The best sources of vitamin Aare eggs, milk, butter, liver, and fish, such as herring, sar-dines, and tuna. Beef is a poor source of vitamin A.Plants do not contain vitamin A, but they do contain beta-carotene and other carotenoids. The best sources of beta-carotene are dark-green, orange, and yellow vegetables;spinach, carrots, oranges, and sweet potatoes are excel-lent examples. Cereals are poor sources of beta-carotene.\nVitamin A is used for two functions in the body.\nUsed in the eye, it is a component of the eye’s light-sen-sitive parts, containing rods and cones, that allow fornight-vision or for seeing in dim-light circumstances.Vitamin A (retinol) occurs in the rods. Another form ofVitamin A, retinoic acid, is used in the body for regulat-ing the development of various tissues, such as the cellsof the skin, and the lining of the lungs and intestines. Vit-amin A is important during embryological development,since, without vitamin A, the fertilized egg cannot devel-op into a fetus.\nCauses and symptoms\nVitamin A deficiency occurs with the chronic con-\nsumption of diets that are deficient in both vitamin A and\nbeta-carotene. When vitamin A deficiency exists in thedeveloped world, it tends to happen in alcoholics or inpeople with diseases that affect the intestine’s ability toabsorb fat. Examples of such diseases are celiac disease\n(chronic nutritional disorder), cystic fibrosis , and\ncholestasis (bile-flow failure or interference). Vitamin A\ndeficiency occurred in infants during the early 1900s inDenmark. The deficiency resulted when milk fat wasmade into butter for export, leaving the by-product(skimmed milk) for infant feeding. Vitamin A deficiencyhas taken place in infants in impoverished populations inIndia, where the only foods fed to the infants were low inbeta-carotene. Vitamin A deficiency is also common inareas like Southeast Asia, where polished rice, whichlacks the vitamin, is a major part of the diet.\nThe earliest symptom of vitamin A deficiency is\nnight blindness. Prolonged deficiency results in drying ofthe conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that lines theinner surface of the eyelids and extends over the forepartof the eyeball). With continued vitamin A deficiency, thedrying extends to the cornea (xerophthalamia). Thecornea eventually shrivels up and becomes ulcerated(keratinomalacia). Superficial, foamy gray triangularspots may appear in the white of the eye (Bitot’s spots).Finally, inflammation and infection occur in the interiorof the eye, resulting in total and irreversible blindness.\nDiagnosis\nVitamin A status is measured by tests for retinol.\nBlood-serum retinol concentrations of 30-60 mg/dl areconsidered in the normal range. Levels that fall belowthis range indicate vitamin A deficiency. Night blindnessis measured by a technique called electroretinography.Xerophthalamia, keratinomalacia, and Bitot’s spots arediagnosed visually by trained medical personnel.\nTreatment\nVitamin A deficiency can be prevented or treated by\ntaking vitamin supplements or by getting injections ofthe vitamin. The specific doses given are oral retinylpalmitate (110 mg), retinyl acetate (66 mg), or injectedretinyl palmitate (55 mg) administered on each of twosuccessive days, and once a few weeks later if symptomsare not relieved.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for correcting night blindness is\nexcellent. Xerophthalamia can be corrected with vitaminA therapy. Ulcerations, tissue death , and total blindness,\ncaused by severe vitamin A deficiency, cannot be treatedwith vitamin A.\nPrevention\nVitamin A deficiency can be prevented by including\nfoods rich in vitamin A or beta-carotene as a regular com-ponent of the diet; liver, meat, eggs, milk, and dairy prod-ucts are examples. Foods rich in beta-carotene include red\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3512Vitamin A deficiencypeppers, carrots, pumpkins, as well as those just men-\ntioned. Margarine is rich in beta-carotene, because thischemical is used as a coloring agent in margarine produc-tion. In Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines, vitamin Adeficiency is prevented by public health programs thatsupply children with injections of the vitamin.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrody, T.

Vitamin B6deficiency is\nrare, since most foods eaten contain the vitamin.\nDescription\nVitamin B6is a water-soluble vitamin. The recom-\nmended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin B6is 2.0\nmg/day for the adult man and 1.6 mg/day for the adultwoman. Vitamin B\n6in the diet generally occurs as a form\ncalled pyridoxal phosphate. In this form, it cannot beabsorbed by the body. During the process of digestion,the phosphate group is removed, and pyridoxal is pro-duced. However, the body readily absorbs pyridoxal, andconverts it back to the active form of the vitamin (pyri-doxal phosphate).\nPoultry, fish, liver, and eggs are good sources of vit-\namin B\n6, comprising about 3-4 mg vitamin/kg food; meat\nand milk contain lesser amounts of the vitamin. The vita-min also occurs, at about half this level, in a variety ofplant foods, including beans, broccoli, cabbage, andpeas. Vitamin B\n6tends to be destroyed with prolonged\ncooking, with storage, or with exposure to light.\nAs mentioned, vitamin B6takes various forms. One\nof these forms, called pyridoxine, is relatively stable. Forthis reason, pyridoxine is the form of vitamin B\n6that is\nused in vitamin supplements, or when foods are fortified.Apples and other fruits are poor sources of the vitamin,containing only 0.2-0.6 mg vitamin/kg food.\nVitamin B\n6, used mainly in the body for the process-\ning of amino acids, performs this task along with certainenzymes. The enzyme that participates in this type of com-plex is aminotransferase. Several types of aminotrans-ferase exist. With vitamin B\n6deficiency, while aminotrans-\nferase continues to occur in the various organs of the body,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3513Vitamin B6deficiencythere is an abnormally low level of the active vitamin\nB6/aminotransferase complex present. Thus, this vitamin\ndeficiency results in the impairment of a variety of activi-ties in the body. With supplement correction of the vitaminB\n6deficiency, the aminotransferase then readily forms the\nactive complex, and normal metabolism is restored.\nVitamin B6converts certain amino acids (glutamic\nacid, aspartic acid, glycine) to energy. This allows thebody to process all dietary protein, even when the dietaryprotein is in excess of the body’s needs. Vitamin B\n6also\nallows the body to synthesize certain amino acids. Forexample, if the diet is deficient or low in certain aminoacids, such as glycine or serine, vitamin B\n6enables the\nbody to make them from sugar. Vitamin B6is used also\nfor the synthesis of certain hormones, such as adrenaline.\nCauses and symptoms\nVitamin B6deficiency occurs rarely. When it does, it\nis usually associated with poor absorption of nutrients inthe gastrointestinal tract (as in alcoholism , or with\nchronic diarrhea ), the taking of certain drugs (as isoni-\nazid, hydrolazine, penicillamine) that inactivate the vita-KEY TERMS\nAmino acid —Amino acids are small molecules\nthat are used as building blocks for all proteins.Some amino acids are also used in the body forthe manufacture of hormones.

These include nervousness, irri-tability, insomnia , muscle weakness, and difficulty in\nwalking. Vitamin B\n6deficiency may produce fissures and\ncracking at the corners of the mouth. The deficiencyoccurred in infants fed early versions of commercialcanned infant formula, when the vitamin had been inad-vertently omitted from the formula. This error resulted ininfants failing to grow, in irritability, and in seizures.\nDiagnosis\nVitamin B6status is measured by the transaminase\nstimulation test. This test requires extraction of red bloodcells, and placement of the cells in two test tubes. Specialchemicals (reagents) are added to both test tubes to allowfor measurement of aminotransferase. This enzymerequires pyridoxal phosphate. A known quantity of purepyridoxal phosphate is added to one of the test tubes. Theactivity level of the enzyme is measured, and compared,in both test tubes. If the added pyridoxal phosphate didnot stimulate activity, the patient is considered not to bedeficient in vitamin B\n6. Neither is the patient considered\ndeficient if only slight stimulation occurred. But if astimulation of four-fold or more occurred, a vitamin B\n6\ndeficiency is present.\nTreatment\nVitamin B6deficiency can be prevented or treated\nwith consumption of the recommended dietary allowance,as supplied by food or by vitamin supplements.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for correcting vitamin B6deficiency\nis excellent.\nPrevention\nVitamin B6deficiency is not a major concern for\nmost people. The deficiency can be prevented with con-sumption of a mixed diet that includes poultry, fish, eggs,meat, vegetables, and grains.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrody, T. Nutritional Biochemistry.

    "title": "Vitamin D deficiency",
    "content": "Vitamin D deficiency\nDefinition\nVitamin D deficiency exists when the concentration\nof 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OH-D) in the blood serumoccurs at 12 ng/ml (nanograms/milliliter), or less. Thenormal concentration of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D in theblood serum is 25-50 ng/ml. When vitamin D deficiencycontinues for many months in growing children, the dis-ease commonly referred to as rickets will occur. A pro-longed deficiency of the vitamin in adults results inosteomalacia. Both diseases involve defects in bones.\nDescription\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it is able\nto be dissolved in fat. While some vitamin D is supplied bythe diet, most of it is made in the body. To make vitamin D,cholesterol, a sterol that is widely distributed in animal tis-sues and occurs in the yolk of eggs, as well as in variousoils and fats, is necessary. Once cholesterol is available inthe body, a slight alteration in the cholesterol moleculeoccurs, with one change taking place in the skin. This alter-ation requires the energy of sunlight (or ultraviolet light).Vitamin D deficiency, as well as rickets and osteomalacia,tends to occur in persons who do not get enough sunlightand who fail to eat foods that are rich in vitamin D.\nOnce consumed, or made in the body, vitamin D is\nfurther altered to produce a hormone called 1,25-dihy-droxy-vitamin D (1,25-diOH-D). The conversion of vita-min D to 1,25-diOH-D does not occur in the skin, but inthe liver and kidney. First, vitamin D is converted to 25-OH-D in the liver; it then enters the bloodstream, whereit is taken-up by the kidneys. At this point, it is convertedto 1,25-diOH-D. Therefore, the manufacture of 1,25-diOH-D requires the participation of various organs ofthe body—the liver, kidney, and skin. \nThe purpose of 1,25-diOH-D in the body is to keep\nthe concentration of calcium at a constant level in thebloodstream. The maintenance of calcium at a constantlevel is absolutely required for human life to exist, sincedissolved calcium is required for nerves and muscles towork. One of the ways in which 1,25-diOH-D accom-plishes this mission is by stimulating the absorption ofdietary calcium by the intestines.\nThe sequence of events that can lead to vitamin D\ndeficiency, then to bone disease, is as follows: a lack ofvitamin D in the body creates an inability to manufacture1,25-diOH-D, which results in decreased absorption ofdietary calcium and increased loss of calcium in thefeces. When this happens, the bones are affected. Vita-min D deficiency results in a lack of bone mineralization(calcification) in growing persons, or in an increaseddemineralization (decalcification) of bone in adults.\nCauses and symptoms\nVitamin D deficiency can be caused by conditions\nthat result in little exposure to sunlight. These conditionsinclude: living in northern countries; having dark skin;being elderly or an infant, and having little chance to gooutside; and covering one’s face and body, such as forreligious reasons. Many Arab women cover the entirebody with black cloth, and wear a veil and black gloveswhen they go outside. These women may acquire vitaminD deficiency, even though they live in a sunny climate.\nMost foods contain little or no vitamin D. As a\nresult, sunshine is often a deciding factor in whether vita-min D deficiency occurs. Although fortified milk andfortified infant formula contain high levels of vitamin D,human breast milk is rather low in the vitamin. The termfortified means that vitamins are added to the food by\nthe manufacturer.\nTo say that a food is high or low in vitamin D means\nhow much of that food needs to be eaten in order to pre-vent vitamin deficiency and maintain good health. Anexact meaning can be provided by comparing the Recom-mended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D with the amountof vitamin D supplied by a particular food per day. TheRecommended Dietary Allowance, also referred to asRDA, is a recommendation based on data derived fromdifferent population groups and ages. The RDA for vita-min D for adults is 200 International Units (IU) per day,and can be supplied by eating approximately 1.5 kg ofbeef, 2.0 kg of corn oil, or 100 kg of cabbage. Few people,though, would want to eat a kilogram of beef in one day,and no human being is capable of eating 100 kg of cab-bage in a day; therefore, these foods are poor sources ofvitamin D. However, saltwater fish such as salmon, her-ring, and sardines are rich in vitamin D, supplied from theoils produced by these fish. The RDA can also be suppliedby eating roughly 50 g of salmon or 2.0 g of cod liver oil,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3515Vitamin D deficiencyand since fortified milk contains 400 IU per quart, half a\nquart of milk provides the RDA. For comparison, humanbreast milk contains only 4 to 60 IU per quart. \nNo harm is likely to result from vitamin D deficien-\ncy that occurs for only a few days a year. If the deficien-cy occurs for a period of many months or years, however,rickets or osteomalacia may develop. The symptoms ofrickets include bowed legs and bowed arms. The bowedappearance is due to the softening of bones, and theirbending if the bones are weight-bearing. Bone growthoccurs through the creation of new cartilage, a soft sub-stance at the ends of bones. When the mineral calciumphosphate is deposited onto the cartilage, a hard structureis created. In vitamin D deficiency, though, calcium isnot available to create hardened bone, and the result issoft bone. Other symptoms of rickets include particularbony bumps on the ribs called rachitic rosary (beadlikeprominences at the junction of the ribs with their carti-lages) and knock-knees. Seizures may also occasionallyoccur in a child with rickets, because of reduced levels ofdissolved calcium in the bloodstream.\nAlthough osteomalacia is rare in the United States,\nsymptoms of this disease include reduced bone strength,an increase in bone fractures , and sometimes bone pain ,\nmuscle weakness, and a waddling walk.\nDiagnosis\nVitamin D deficiency is diagnosed by measuring the\nlevel of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D in the blood serum. Thenormal level or concentration of this form of the vitaminranges from 25-50 ng/ml. Deficiency occurs when thislevel decreases to about 12 ng/ml or less. As mentionedpreviously, 25-OH-D is not the active form of the vita-min. It must be converted to 1,25-diOH-D in order tocause responses in various organs of the body. However,the levels of vitamin D, or of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin Din the blood, do not give a reliable picture of whether aperson is deficient in the vitamin. For this reason, theyare not measured when testing for vitamin D deficiency.\nRickets is diagnosed by x-ray examination of leg\nbones. A distinct pattern of irregularities, abnormalities,and a coarse appearance can be clearly seen with rickets.Osteomalacia is also diagnosed with x-ray examination.Measurements of blood plasma 25-OH-D, blood plasmacalcium, and blood plasma parathyroid hormone mustalso be obtained for the diagnosis of these diseases.Parathyroid hormone and 1,25-diOH-D work together inthe body to regulate the levels of calcium in the blood.\nTreatment\nRickets heals promptly with 4,000 IU of oral vita-\nmin D per day administered for approximately onemonth. During this treatment, the doctor should monitor\nthe levels of 25-OH-D in the plasma to make certain theyare raised to a normal value. The bone abnormalities(visible by x ray) generally disappear gradually over aperiod of 3-9 months. Parents are instructed to take theirinfants outdoors for approximately 20 minutes per daywith their faces exposed. Children should also be encour-aged to play outside. Foods that are good sources of vita-min D include cod liver oil, egg yolks, butter, and oilyfish. Some foods, including milk and breakfast cereals,are also fortified with synthetic vitamin D.\nOsteomalacia is treated by eating 2,500 IU per day\nof vitamin D for about three months. Measurements of25-OH-D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone should beobtained after the treatment period to make sure the ther-apy did, in fact, result in normal blood values.\nCare must be taken in treating vitamin D deficiency,\nsince high doses of vitamin D are toxic and can result inthe permanent deposit of minerals in the heart, lungs, and\nkidneys. Symptoms of toxicity are nausea, vomiting, painin joints, and lack of interest in eating food. In adults, vit-amin D toxicity occurs with eating 50,000 IU or more perday. In infants, toxicity occurs with 1,000 IU per day. Thecontinued intake of toxic doses results in death .\nRickets and osteomalacia are almost always treated\nwith oral supplements of vitamin D, with the recommen-dation to acquire daily exposure to direct sunlight. Analternative to sunlight is the use of an ultraviolet (UV)lamp. When using UV lamps, the eyes must be coveredto protect them against damage. Many types of sunglass-es allow UV light to pass through, so only those that areopaque to UV light should be used. Attempts to acquiresunlight through glass windows fail to help the bodymake vitamin D. This is because UV light does not passthrough window glass.\nRickets may also occur with calcium deficiency,\neven when a child is regularly exposed to sunshine. Thistype of rickets has been found in various parts of Africa.The bone deformities are similar to, or are the same as,those that occur in typical rickets; however, calcium defi-ciency rickets is treated by increasing the amount of cal-cium in the diet. No amount of vitamin D can cure therickets of a child with a diet that is extremely low in cal-cium. For this reason, it is recommended that calcium begiven in conjunction with vitamin D supplementation.\nPrognosis\nThe prognoses for correcting vitamin D deficiency,\nrickets, and osteomalacia are excellent. Vitamin D treat-ment results in the return of bone mineralization to a nor-mal rate, the correction of low plasma calcium levels, theprevention of seizures, and a recovery from bone pain.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3516Vitamin D deficiencyOn the other hand, deformities such as bowed legs and\nthe rachitic rosary persist throughout adult life. \nPrevention\nFood fortification has almost completely eliminated\nrickets in the United States. Vitamin D deficiency can beprevented by acquiring the RDA through drinking fortifiedmilk and eating fortified cereals. For those who cannotdrink milk, supplements of pills might be considered. Insome older people, a 400 IU supplement may not be enoughto result in the normal absorption of calcium; therefore,daily doses of 10,000 IU per day may be needed. For infantswho are fed only breast milk (and rarely exposed to sun-shine), a daily supplement of 200-300 IU is recommended.\nRickets continues to be a problem in Africans and\nAsian Indians who migrate to Canada or Great Britain,KEY TERMS\n25-hydroxy-vitamin D —This is the form of vita-\nmin D that is measured in order to assess vitaminD deficiency.\nCholesterol —A fat-soluble steroid alcohol (sterol)\nfound in animal fats and oils, and in egg yolks.The human body needs cholesterol to producevitamin D.\nFat-soluble vitamin —A vitamin that dissolves easi-\nly in fat or oil, but not in water.

    "title": "Vitamin E deficiency",
    "content": "Vitamin E deficiency\nDefinition\nVitamin E deficiency is a very rare problem that\nresults in damage to nerves. When vitamin E deficiencydoes occur, it strikes people with diseases that preventthe absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble nutrients.Since vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, it has some ofthe properties of fat.\nDescription\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vita-\nmin E is 10 mg/day for the adult man, 8 mg/day for theadult woman, and 3 mg/day for the infant. Vitamin Eoccurs in foods in a variety of related forms. The mostpotent and useful form of vitamin E is called alpha-toco-pherol. The best sources of vitamin E are vegetable oils,such as corn oil, soy oil, and peanut oil. Animal fats, suchas butter and lard, contain lower levels of the vitamin.Corn oil contains about 16 mg of alpha-tocopherol per 100\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3517Vitamin E deficiencyg oil. Wheat-germ oil contains 120 mg alpha-tocopherol\nper 100 g oil. Fish, eggs, and beef contain relatively lowlevels of the vitamin, with about 1 mg per 100 g food.\nVitamin E seems to have only one function in the\nbody: the prevention of the natural and continual processof deterioration of all body tissues. This deterioration isprovoked by a number of causes; one of these is toxic oxy-gen. During the body’s metabolism of atmospheric oxy-gen, toxic oxygen is produced continuously in the body bythe formation of by-products. These toxic by-productsinclude hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and hypochlorite.\nHypochlorite is a natural product, produced by cells\nof the immune system. It is also the active component ofbleach. Once formed, toxic oxygen can damage variousparts of the body, such as the membranes which form theboundaries of every cell. Vitamin E serves the body in pro-tecting membranes from toxic oxygen damage. In con-trast, vitamin C serves to protect the aqueous, or watery,regions of the cell from toxic oxygen damage. The mem-branes that are most sensitive to toxic oxygen damage arethe membranes of nerves; therefore, the main symptom ofvitamin E deficiency is damage to the nervous system.KEY TERMS\nFat-soluble vitamin —Fat-soluble vitamins can be\ndissolved in oil or in melted fat.\nRecommended Dietary Allowance —The Recom-\nmended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are quantitiesof nutrients in the diet that are required to main-tain good health in people. RDAs are establishedby the Food and Nutrition Board of the NationalAcademy of Sciences, and may be revised everyfew years. A separate RDA value exists for eachnutrient. The RDA values refer to the amount ofnutrient expected to maintain good health in peo-ple. The actual amounts of each nutrient requiredto maintain good health in specific individuals dif-fer from person to person.\nToxic oxygen —Oxygen is required for life, as it is\nneeded for energy production. When oxygen isused by the body, most of it is converted to water.However, a small fraction of the oxygen breathedis converted to toxic oxygen. The body uses sever-al different processes for preventing and repairingtoxic-oxygen damage. One of these processesinvolves vitamin E.\nWater-soluble vitamins —Water-soluble vitamins\ncan be dissolved in water or juice.Causes and symptoms\nAs mentioned, when vitamin E deficiency occurs, it\nstrikes people with diseases that prevent the absorptionof dietary fats and fat-soluble nutrients. These diseasesinclude cystic fibrosis ,pancreatitis , and cholestasis\n(bile-flow obstruction). Bile salts, produced in the liver,are required for the absorption of fats. Cholestasis causesa decrease in the formation of bile salts and the conse-quent failure of the body to absorb dietary fats. For thisreason, this disease may result in vitamin E deficiency.Premature infants may be at risk for vitamin E deficiencybecause they may be born with low tissue levels of thevitamin, and because they have a poorly developedcapacity for absorbing dietary fats. Infants suffering fromfat-malabsorption diseases can develop symptoms of vit-amin E deficiency by age two. In adults, the onset of afat-malabsorption disease can provoke vitamin E defi-ciency after a longer period, as an example, ten years.\nVitamin E deficiency in humans results in ataxia\n(poor muscle coordination with shaky movements),decreased sensation to vibration, lack of reflexes, andparalysis of eye muscles. One particularly severe symp-\ntom of vitamin E deficiency is the inability to walk.\nDiagnosis\nVitamin E status is measured by assessment of the\ncontent of alpha-tocopherol in the blood plasma, using amethod called high-pressure liquid chromatography.Blood plasma levels of alpha-tocopherol that are 5.0mg/l, or above, indicate normal vitamin E status; levelsbelow 5.0 mg/l indicate vitamin E deficiency.\nTreatment\nVitamin E deficiency that occurs with cholestatic\nliver disease, or other malabsorption syndromes, can betreated with weekly injections of 100 mg alpha-toco-pherol that may continue for six months.Vitamin E defi-ciency in premature infants may require treatment foronly a few weeks.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for correcting the neurological symp-\ntoms of vitamin E deficiency is fair to excellent.\nPrevention\nThe prevention of vitamin E deficiency should not\nbe a concern for most people, since the vitamin is foundin a wide variety of foods. Attention has been given tothe theory that vitamin E serves to protect against cancer\nand atherosclerosis . The evidence that normal levels of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3518Vitamin E deficiencyvitamin E protect against atherosclerosis is fairly con-\nvincing. However, there is little or no proof that vitaminE intake, above and beyond the recommended dailyallowance (RDA), can prevent cancer or atherosclerosis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrody, T.

    "title": "Vitamin K deficiency",
    "content": "Vitamin K deficiency\nDefinition\nVitamin K deficiency exists when chronic failure to\neat sufficient amounts of vitamin K results in a tendencyfor spontaneous bleeding or in prolonged and excessivebleeding with trauma or injury. Vitamin K deficiencyoccurs also in newborn infants, as well as in people treat-ed with certain antibiotics . The protein in the body most\naffected by vitamin K deficiency is a blood-clotting pro-tein called prothrombin.\nDescription\nVitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin. The recommend-\ned dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin K is 80 mg/dayfor the adult man, 65 mg/day for the adult woman, and 5mg/day for the newborn infant. The vitamin K present inplant foods is called phylloquinone; while the form of thevitamin present in animal foods is called menaquinone.Both of these vitamins are absorbed from the diet and\nconverted to an active form called dihydrovitamin K.\nSpinach, lettuce, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cab-\nbage are good sources of vitamin K, containing about 8mg vitamin K/kg food. Cow milk is also a good source ofthe vitamin.\nA portion of the body’s vitamin K is supplied by bac-\nteria living in the intestine rather than by dietary sources.Vitamin K plays an important role in blood clot-\nting. Without the vitamin, even a small cut would causecontinuous bleeding in the body, and death . Blood clot-\nting is a process that begins automatically when anyinjury produces a tear in a blood vessel. The process ofblood clotting involves a collection of molecules, whichcirculate continuously through the bloodstream. Whenan injury occurs, these molecules rapidly assemble andform the blood clot. The clotting factors are proteins,and include proteins called Factor II, Factor VII, FactorIX, and Factor X. Factor II is also called prothrombin.These proteins require vitamin K for their synthesis inthe body. The blood-clotting process also requires adozen other proteins that do not need vitamin K fortheir synthesis.\nCauses and symptoms\nNewborns are especially prone to vitamin K defi-\nciency. A nursing-mother’s milk is low in the vitamin;breast milk can supply only about 20% of the infant’srequirement. Infants are born with low levels of vitaminK in their body; they do not have any vitamin K-produc-ing bacteria in their intestines. Their digestive tracts aresterile. As a result, a form of vitamin K deficiency, calledhemorrhagic disease of the newborn, may develop. Thisdisease involves spontaneous bleeding beneath the skinor elsewhere in the infant’s body, and occurs in about 1%of all infants. In rare cases, it causes death due to sponta-neous bleeding in the brain.\nVitamin K deficiency in adults is rare. When it\noccurs, it is found in people with diseases that preventthe absorption of fat. These diseases include cystic\nfibrosis ,celiac disease , and cholestasis . Vitamin K\ndeficiency can exist in adults treated with antibioticsthat kill the bacteria that normally live in the digestivetract. As mentioned, the intestine-bacteria supply partof our daily requirement of vitamin K. Vitamin K defi-ciency can result in bleeding gums, and in skin that iseasily bruised.\nDiagnosis\nVitamin K status is measured by the prothrombin\ntime test. The normal prothrombin time is about 13 sec-\nonds. With vitamin K deficiency, the prothrombin timecan be several minutes. The test involves taking a sam-ple of blood, placing it in a machine called a fibrometer,and measuring the time it takes for blood-clot formation.Blood-clotting problems can also be caused by a raregenetic disease called hemophilia . Hemophilia is not\nrelated to vitamin K deficiency. Once vitamin K defi-ciency is suspected, further tests must be used to distin-guish it from possible hemophilia. Where a bleeding dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3519Vitamin K deficiencyorder can be corrected by vitamin K treatment, the diag-\nnosis of vitamin K deficiency is proven to be correct.\nTreatment\nVitamin K deficiency in newborn infants is treated\nand prevented with a single injection of phylloquinone (5mg). Adults with vitamin K deficiency are treated withdaily oral doses of 10 mg phylloquinone for one week.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for correcting vitamin K deficiency,\nand associated blood-clotting problems, is excellent.\nPrevention\nAside from newborns and young infants, vitamin K\ndeficiency is not a concern for the general population.Vitamin K deficiency can be prevented by assuring thatthe diet contains foods such as spinach, cabbage, brusselssprouts, and eggs. Soybean oil, canola oil, and olive oilare good sources of the vitamin, while corn oil andpeanut oil are very poor sources.KEY TERMS\nFat-soluble vitamin —Fat-soluble vitamins can be\ndissolved in oil or in melted fat.\nHemorrhage —Bleeding that continues for an\nabnormally long period of time.\nProthrombin —Prothrombin is a blood-clotting\nprotein.

    "content": "Vitamin tests\nDefinition\nVitamin tests measure the levels of certain vitamins\nin an individual’s blood. They are generally used to aid inthe diagnosis of vitamin deficiencies or in detecting toxicamounts of a vitamin in a patient’s system.\nPurpose\nVitamins are components of food that are needed for\ngrowth, reproduction, and maintaining good health. Thevitamins include vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin A, andvitamin K, which are the fat-soluble vitamins, and folate,vitamin B\n12, biotin, vitamin B6, niacin, thiamin,\nriboflavin, pantothenic acid, and ascorbic acid, which arethe water-soluble vitamins. Vitamins are required in thediet in only tiny amounts, in contrast to the energy com-ponents of the diet, such as sugars, starches, and fats.However, not receiving sufficient quantities of a certainvitamin can be devastating, resulting in vitamin deficien-cy diseases such as scurvy ,pellagra , or rickets. Con-\nversely, consuming too much of a certain vitamin can betoxic to a person’s system. Vitamin tests are used toassess the level of certain vitamins in an individual’sblood so that doctors can more accurately diagnose vita-min deficiency diseases or vitamin overdoses and deviseeffective therapy. The vitamins that are most commonlymeasured by doctors are folate, vitamin B\n12, vitamin K,\nvitamin D, and vitamin A.\nDescription\nMost of the vitamin tests are conducted by acquiring\na sample of blood, and then preparing plasma or serum\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3520Vitamin testsfrom the blood sample. Each vitamin occurs at extremely\nsmall concentrations when compared to levels of mostother molecules in the blood. Blood contains a greatnumber of chemicals and molecules, and many of thesetend to interfere with the vitamin tests. For this reason, aprocedure that separates the vitamin from contaminatingsubstances is usually performed immediately prior toconducting the actual test. Most laboratories use highpressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), also calledhigh performance liquid chromatography, as this purifi-cation step. In HPLC, the sample is pumped at high pres-sure through a tube lined with an absorbent material, towhich the different molecules cling at different rates.Following separation or purification by HPLC, the vita-min is detected by a color reaction or fluorescence reac-tion. In these reactions, the amount of color or fluores-cence that is formed is proportional to the amount of vit-amin in the sample, allowing the analyst to calculate theamount of vitamin present in the original sample. In thecase of some vitamins, the purified vitamin is reactedwith a special chemical (reagent) prior to detection.\nLevels of some vitamins may be measured indirectly\nby a biological test that mimics the actual function of thevitamin in the body. Riboflavin status is often measuredby a test in which the rate by which a certain enzymeconverts one molecule into another indicates how muchVitamin B\n2is present in a person’s blood. Vitamin K is\noften measured by a test that times how long it takes for aspontaneous blood clot to form in a prepared sample. Vit-amin E status is often measured by placing the red bloodcells in a test tube, adding hydrogen peroxide, and theassessing the resulting breakdown of the red blood cells.When a vitamin E deficiency exists, the red blood cells\nhave a greater tendency to break.\nPreparation\nMost vitamin tests require no preparation; however,\nsome may require that the patient fast for at least eighthours before giving a blood sample, or stop using somemedications.\nNormal results\nThe values that are considered to be normal for each\nvitamin can vary slightly. This variability can arise fromdifferent testing machines or from different types ofchemistry that are used in conducting the vitamin assays.In interpreting data on plasma vitamin levels, it shouldalso be noted that different normal ranges may exist fordifferent age groups and genders. For example, the nor-mal range for plasma vitamin B\n6for males is 7-52\nnanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) for males and 2-26ng/mL for females.The normal ranges for levels of certain vitamins are\nas follows. Please note that, by convention, the unitsreferring to the levels of each of the vitamins may differfrom each other.

    "title": "Vitamin toxicity",
    "content": "Vitamin toxicity\nDefinition\nVitamin toxicity is a condition in which a person\ndevelops symptoms as side effects from taking massivedoses of vitamins . Vitamins vary in the amounts that are\nrequired to cause toxicity and in the specific symptomsthat result. Vitamin toxicity, which is also called hypervit-aminosis or vitamin poisoning , is becoming more com-\nmon in developed countries because of the popularity of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3521Vitamin toxicityvitamin supplements. Many people treat themselves for\nminor illnesses with large doses (megadoses) of vitamins.\nDescription\nOverview\nVitamins are organic molecules in food that are needed\nin small amounts for growth, reproduction, and the mainte-nance of good health. Some vitamins can be dissolved in oilor melted fat. These fat-soluble vitamins include vitamin D,vitamin E, vitamin A (retinol), and vitamin K. Other vita-mins can be dissolved in water. These water-soluble vita-mins include folate ( folic acid ), vitamin B\n12, biotin, vitamin\nB6, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin\nC (ascorbic acid). Taking too much of any vitamin can pro-duce a toxic effect. Vitamin A and vitamin D are the mostlikely to produce hypervitaminosis in large doses, whileriboflavin, pantothenic acid, biotin, and vitamin C appear tobe the least likely to cause problems.\nVitamins in medical treatment\nVitamin supplements are used for the treatment of\nvarious diseases or for reducing the risk of certain dis-eases. For example, moderate supplements of folic acidappear to reduce the risk for certain birth defects (neural\ntube defects), and possibly reduce the risk of cancer .\nTherapy for diseases brings with it the risk for irre-versible vitamin toxicity only in the case of vitamin D.This vitamin is toxic at levels which are only moderatelygreater than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA).Niacin is commonly used as a drug for the treatment ofheart disease. Niacin is far less toxic than vitamin D. Vit-amin toxicity is not a risk with medically supervisedtherapy using any of the other vitamins.\nVitamin megadoses\nWith the exception of folic acid supplements, the\npractice of taking vitamin supplements by healthy indi-viduals has little or no relation to good health. Mostadults in the United States can obtain enough vitamins byeating a well-balanced diet. It has, however, becomeincreasingly common for people to take vitamins at lev-els far greater than the RDA. These high levels are some-times called vitamin megadoses. Megadoses are harm-less for most vitamins. But in the cases of a few of thevitamins—specifically vitamin D, vitamin A, and vita-min B\n6—megadoses can be harmful or fatal. Researchers\nhave also started to look more closely at megadoses ofvitamin C and of vitamin E, since indirect evidence sug-gests that these two vitamins may reduce the risks of can-cer, heart disease, and aging . It is not yet clear whether\nmegadoses of either of these vitamins has any influenceon health. Some experts think that megadoses of vitaminC may protect people from cancer. On the other hand,\nother researchers have gathered indirect evidence thatvitamin C megadoses may cause cancer.\nCauses and symptoms\nFat-soluble vitamins\nVITAMIN D. Vitamin D and vitamin A are the most\ntoxic of the fat-soluble vitamins. The symptoms of vita-min D toxicity are nausea, vomiting, pain in the joints,\nand loss of appetite. The patient may experience consti-\npation alternating with diarrhea , or have tingling sensa-\ntions in the mouth. The toxic dose of vitamin D dependson its frequency. In infants, a single dose of 15 mg orgreater may be toxic, but it is also the case that dailydoses of 1.0 mg over a prolonged period may be toxic. Inadults, a daily dose of 1.0-2.0 mg of vitamin D is toxicwhen consumed for a prolonged period. A single dose ofabout 50 mg or greater is toxic for adults. The immediateeffect of an overdose of vitamin D is abdominal cramps,nausea and vomiting . Toxic doses of vitamin D taken\nover a prolonged period of time result in irreversibledeposits of calcium crystals in the soft tissues of the bodythat may damage the heart, lungs, and kidneys.\nVITAMIN A. Vitamin A toxicity can occur with long-\nterm consumption of 20 mg of retinol or more per day.The symptoms of vitamin A overdosing include accumu-lation of water in the brain ( hydrocephalus ), vomiting,\ntiredness, constipation, bone pain, and severe headaches.The skin may acquire a rough and dry appearance, withhair loss and brittle nails. Vitamin A toxicity is a specialissue during pregnancy . Expectant mothers who take 10\nmg vitamin A or more on a daily basis may have aninfant with birth defects. These birth defects includeabnormalities of the face, nervous system, heart, and thy-mus gland. It is possible to take in toxic levels of vitaminA by eating large quantities of certain foods. For exam-ple, about 30 grams of beef liver, 500 grams of eggs, or2,500 grams of mackerel would supply 10 mg of retinol.The livers of polar bears and other arctic animals maycontain especially high levels of vitamin A.\nVITAMIN E. Megadoses of vitamin E may produce\nheadaches, tiredness, double vision, and diarrhea inhumans. Studies with animals fed large doses of vitaminE have revealed that this vitamin may interfere with theabsorption of other fat-soluble vitamins. The termabsorption means the transfer of the vitamin from the gutinto the bloodstream. Thus, large doses of vitamin E con-sumed over many weeks or months might result in defi-ciencies of vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamin K.\nVITAMIN K. Prolonged consumption of megadoses\nof vitamin K (menadione) results in anemia, which is a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3522Vitamin toxicityreduced level of red blood cells in the bloodstream.\nWhen large doses of menadione are given to infants, theyresult in the deposit of pigments in the brain, nerve dam-age, the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), anddeath . A daily injection of 10 mg of menadione into an\ninfant for three days can kill the child. This tragic factwas discovered during the early days of vitamin research,when newborn infants were injected with menadione toprevent a disease known as hemorrhagic disease of thenewborn. Today a different form of vitamin K is used toprotect infants against this disease.\nWater-soluble vitamins\nFOLATE. Folate occurs in various forms in food.\nThere are over a dozen related forms of folate. The folatein oral vitamin supplements occurs in only one form,however—folic acid. Large doses of folic acid (20grams/day) can result in eventual kidney damage. Folateis considered, however, to be relatively nontoxic, exceptin cases where folate supplementation can lead to perni-\ncious anemia .\nVITAMIN B 12.Vitamin B12is important in the treat-\nment of pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is morecommon among middle-aged and older adults; it is usu-ally detected in patients between the ages of 40 and 80.The disease affects about 0.1% of all persons in the gen-eral population in the United States, and about 3% of theelderly population. Pernicious anemia is treated withlarge doses of vitamin B\n12. Typically, 0.1 mg of the vita-\nmin is injected each week until the symptoms of perni-cious anemia disappear. The patient then takes oral dosesof vitamin B\n12for the rest of his or her life. Although vit-\namin B12toxicity is not an issue for patients being treated\nfor pernicious anemia, treatment of these patients withfolic acid may cause problems. Specifically, perniciousanemia is often first detected because the patient feelsweak or tired. If the anemia is not treated, the patientmay suffer irreversible nerve damage. The problem withfolic acid supplements is that the folic acid treatment pre-vents the anemia from developing, but allows the eventu-al nerve damage to occur.\nVITAMIN B 6.Vitamin B6is clearly toxic at doses\nabout 1000 times the RDA. Daily doses of 2-5 grams ofone specific form of this vitamin can produce difficultyin walking and tingling sensations in the legs and soles ofthe feet. Continued megadoses of vitamin B\n6result in\nfurther unsteadiness, difficulty in handling small objects,and numbness in the hands. When the high doses arestopped, recovery begins after two months. Completerecovery may take two to three years.\nVITAMIN C. The RDA for vitamin C in adults is 60 mg\nper day. Large doses of vitamin C are considered to betoxic in persons with a family history of or tendency to\nform kidney stones or gallbladder stones. Kidney and gall-\nbladder stones usually consist of calcium oxalate. Oxalateoccurs in high concentrations in foods such as cocoa,chocolate, rhubarb, and spinach. A fraction of the vitaminC in the body is normally broken down in the body to pro-duce oxalate. A daily supplement of 3.0 grams of vitamin Chas been found to double the level of oxalate that passesthrough the kidneys and is excreted into the urine.\nNIACIN. The RDA for niacin is 15-19 mg per day in\nadults. Niacin comes in two forms, nicotinic acid andnicotinamide. Either form can satisfy the adult require-ment for this vitamin. Nicotinic acid, however, is toxic atlevels of 100 times the RDA. It can cause flushing of theskin, nausea, diarrhea, and liver damage. Flushing is anincrease in blood passing through the veins in the skin,due to the dilation of arteries passing through deeperparts of the face or other parts of the body. In spite of theside effects, however, large doses of nicotinic acid areoften used to lower blood cholesterol in order to preventheart disease. Nicotinic acid results in a lowering ofLDL-cholesterol (“bad cholesterol”), an increase inHDL-cholesterol (“good cholesterol”), and a decrease inplasma triglycerides. Treatment involves daily doses of1.5-4.0 grams of nicotinic acid per day. Flushing of theskin occurs as a side effect when nicotinic acid therapy isstarted, but may disappear with continued therapy.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of vitamin toxicity is usually made on\nthe basis of the patient’s dietary or medical history.Questioning the patient about the use of vitamin supple-ments may shed light on some of his or her physicalsymptoms. With some vitamins, the doctor can confirmthe diagnosis by ordering blood or urine tests for specificvitamins. When large amounts of the water-soluble vita-mins are consumed, a large fraction of the vitamin isabsorbed into the bloodstream and promptly excretedinto the urine. The fat-soluble vitamins are more likely tobe absorbed into the bloodstream and deposited in the fatand other tissues. In the cases of both water-soluble andfat-soluble vitamins, any vitamin not absorbed by theintestines is excreted in the feces. Megadoses of many ofthe vitamins produce diarrhea, because the non-absorbednutrient draws water out of the body and into the gut,resulting in the loss of this water from the body.\nTreatment\nIn all cases, treatment of vitamin toxicity requires dis-\ncontinuing vitamin supplements. Vitamin D toxicity needsadditional action to reduce the calcium levels in the blood-stream because it can cause abnormally high levels of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3523Vitamin toxicityplasma calcium ( hypercalcemia ). Severe hypercalcemia\nis a medical emergency and may be treated by infusing asolution of 0.9% sodium chloride into the patient’s blood-stream. The infusion consists of two to three liters of saltwater given over a period of one to two days.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for reversing vitamin toxicity is excel-\nlent for most patients. Side effects usually go away assoon as overdoses are stopped. The exceptions are severevitamin D toxicity, severe vitamin A toxicity, and severevitamin B\n6toxicity. Too much vitamin D leads to deposits\nof calcium salts in the soft tissue of the body, which can-not be reversed. Birth defects due to vitamin A toxicitycannot be reversed. Damage to the nervous system causedby megadoses of vitamin B\n6can be reversed, but complete\nreversal may require a recovery period of over a year.\nPrevention\nVitamin toxicity can be prevented by minimizing the\nuse of vitamin supplements. If vitamin D supplements arebeing used on a doctor’s orders, vitamin toxicity can beprevented by monitoring the levels of plasma calcium. Thedevelopment of hypercalcemia with vitamin D treatmentindicates that the patient is at risk for vitamin D toxicity.KEY TERMS\nAbsorption —The transfer of a vitamin from the\ndigestive tract to the bloodstream.\nAscorbic acid —Another name for vitamin C.\nHypercalcemia —Hypercalcemia is a condition\nmarked by abnormally high levels of calcium inthe blood.

    "title": "Vitamins",
    "content": "Vitamins\nDefinition\nVitamins are organic components in food that are\nneeded in very small amounts for growth and for main-taining good health. The vitamins include vitamin D, vit-amin E, vitamin A, and vitamin K, or the fat-soluble vita-mins, and folate ( folic acid ), vitamin B\n12, biotin, vitamin\nB6, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and vita-\nmin C (ascorbic acid), or the water-soluble vitamins. Vit-amins are required in the diet in only tiny amounts, incontrast to the energy components of the diet. The energycomponents of the diet are sugars, starches, fats, and oils,and these occur in relatively large amounts in the diet.\nMost of the vitamins are closely associated with a\ncorresponding vitamin deficiency disease. Vitamin D\ndeficiency causes rickets, a disease of the bones. Vita-\nmin E deficiency occurs only very rarely, and causes\nnerve damage. Vitamin A deficiency is common\nthroughout the poorer parts of the world, and causesnight blindness. Severe vitamin A deficiency can resultin xerophthalamia, a disease which, if left untreated,results in total blindness. Vitamin K deficiency results\nin spontaneous bleeding. Mild or moderate folate defi-ciency is common throughout the world, and can resultfrom the failure to eat green, leafy vegetables or fruitsand fruit juices. Folate deficiency causes megaloblasticanemia, which is characterized by the presence of largeabnormal cells called megaloblasts in the circulatingblood. The symptoms of megaloblastic anemia are tired-ness and weakness. Vitamin B\n12deficiency occurs with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3524Vitaminsthe failure to consume meat, milk or other dairy prod-\nucts. Vitamin B12deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia\nand, if severe enough, can result in irreversible nervedamage. Niacin deficiency results in pellagra . Pellagra\ninvolves skin rashes and scabs, diarrhea , and mental\ndepression. Thiamin deficiency results in beriberi , a dis-\nease resulting in atrophy, weakness of the legs, nervedamage, and heart failure . Vitamin C deficiency results\nin scurvy , a disease that involves bleeding. Specific dis-\neases uniquely associated with deficiencies in vitaminB\n6, riboflavin, or pantothenic acid have not been found in\nthe humans, though persons who have been starving, orconsuming poor diets for several months, might be\nexpected to be deficient in most of the nutrients, includ-ing vitamin B\n6, riboflavin, and pantothenic acid. \nSome of the vitamins serve only one function in the\nbody, while other vitamins serve a variety of unrelatedfunctions. Hence, some vitamin deficiencies tend toresult in one type of defect, while other deficienciesresult in a variety of problems.\nPurpose\nPeople are treated with vitamins for three reasons.\nThe primary reason is to relieve a vitamin deficiency,when one has been detected. Chemical tests suitable forthe detection of all vitamin deficiencies are available.The diagnosis of vitamin deficiency is often aided byvisual tests, such as the examination of blood cells with amicroscope, the x ray examination of bones, or a visualexamination of the eyes or skin.A second reason for vitamin treatment is to prevent\nthe development of an expected deficiency. Here, vita-mins are administered even with no test for possible defi-ciency. One example is vitamin K treatment of newborninfants to prevent bleeding. Food supplementation isanother form of vitamin treatment. The vitamin D addedto foods serves the purpose of preventing the deficiencyfrom occurring in persons who may not be exposed muchto sunlight and who fail to consume foods that are forti-fied with vitamin D, such as milk. Niacin supplementa-tion prevents pellagra, a disease that occurs in peoplewho rely heavily on corn as the main source of food, andwho do not eat much meat or milk. In general, the Amer-ican food supply is fortified with niacin.\nA third reason for vitamin treatment is to reduce the\nrisk for diseases that may occur even when vitamin defi-ciency cannot be detected by chemical tests. One exam-ple is folate deficiency. The risk for cardiovascular dis-ease can be slightly reduced for a large fraction of thepopulation by folic acid supplements. And the risk forcertain birth defects can be sharply reduced in certain\nwomen by folic acid supplements.\nVitamin treatment is important during specific dis-\neases where the body’s normal processing of a vitamin isimpaired. In these cases, high doses of the needed vita-min can force the body to process or utilize it in the nor-mal manner. One example is pernicious anemia , a dis-\nease that tends to occur in middle age or old age, andimpairs the absorption of vitamin B\n12. Surveys have\nrevealed that about 0.1% of the general population, and2-3% of the elderly, may have the disease.

Injections are useful for personswith diseases that prevent absorption of fat-soluble vita-mins. Oral vitamin supplements are especially useful forpersons who otherwise cannot or will not consume foodthat is a good vitamin source, such as meat, milk or otherdairy products. For example, a vegetarian who will notconsume meat may be encouraged to consume oral sup-plements of vitamin B\n12. \nTreatment of genetic diseases which impair the\nabsorption or utilization of specific vitamins may requiremegadoses of the vitamin throughout one’s lifetime.Megadose means a level of about 10-1,000 times greaterthan the RDA.

Peo-ple with vitiligo may have eye abnormalities and alsohave a higher incidence of thyroid disease, diabetes mel-\nlitus, and pernicious anemia . Vitiligo affects about 1-2%\nof the world’s population. It is more easily observed insun-exposed areas of the body and in darker skin types,but it affects any area of the body and all races. Vitiligoseems to affect men and women equally, although womenmore frequently seek treatment for the disorder.\nVitiligo may appear as one or two well-defined\nwhite patches or it may appear over large portions of thebody. Typical sites for generalized vitiligo are areas sur-rounding body openings, bony areas, fingers, and toes. Itcan begin at any age but about 50% of the time it startsbefore the age of 20. \nCauses and symptoms\nVitiligo is a disorder with complex causes. People\nwith vitiligo seem to inherit a genetic predisposition forthe disorder, and the appearance of disorder can bebrought on by a variety of precipitating causes. Manypeople report that their vitiligo first appeared following atraumatic or stressful event, such as an accident, job loss,death of a family member, severe sunburn , or serious\nillness. There are at least three theories about the under-lying mechanism of vitiligo. One theory says nerve end-ings in the skin release a chemical that is toxic to themelanocytes. A second theory states that the melanocytessimply self-destruct. The third explanation is that vitiligois a type of autoimmune disease in which the immunesystem targets the body’s own cells and tissues.\nThe primary symptom of vitiligo is the loss of skin\ncolor. Hair growing from the affected skin areas alsolacks color. In addition, people with vitiligo may havepigment abnormalities of the retina or iris of the eyes. Aminority of patients also may have inflammation of theretina or iris, but vision is not usually impaired.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of vitiligo is usually made by observa-\ntion. Progressive, white areas found at typical sites pointto a diagnosis of vitiligo. If the diagnosis is not certain,the doctor will test for other conditions which can mimicvitiligo, such as chemical leukoderma or systemic lupus\nerythematosus . If the tests rule out other conditions,\nvitiligo is confirmed.\nTreatment\nVitiligo cannot be cured, but it can be managed.\nCosmetics can be used to improve the appearance of thewhite areas not covered by clothing. Sunscreens prevent\nburning of the affected areas and also prevent the normalskin around the patches from becoming darker. Skincreams and oral medications are available for severecases, but they have side effects that may make themundesirable. Autologous transplantation of skin is anoption for those who are severely affected. Bleaching ordepigmentation of the normal skin is another option.\nIn addition to treating the skin, attention should be\npaid to the psychological well-being of the individual.Extreme cases of vitiligo can be unattractive and mayaffect a person’s outlook and social interactions.\nPrognosis\nThe condition is usually gradually progressive.\nSometimes the patches grow rapidly over a short period,and then the condition remains stable for many years.\nPrevention\nNo measures are currently known to prevent vitiligo.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFitzpatrick, Thomas B., et al., eds.

    "title": "Vocal cord paralysis",
    "content": "Vocal cord paralysis\nDefinition\nV ocal cord paralysis is the inability to move the\nvocal cords and the resulting loss of vocal cord function.\nDescription\nThe vocal cords are a pair of tough, fibrous bands\nthat lie across the air column in the middle of the voicebox. They assist three functions: breathing, swallowing,and speaking. When vocal cords vibrate, they producesound, allowing us to speak. V ocal cords temporarilystop breathing to aid coughing and for expelling foreign\nobjects . During swallowing, the vocal cords shut the air-\nway so that food is not inhaled. When vocal cords areparalyzed, all three functions are affected.\nThe relaxed position of the vocal cords is halfway\nopen. There is one set of muscles that closes them all theway and one set that opens them. Each set of muscles iscontrolled by a different nerve. Each nerve comes from adifferent direction—one from above and one from below(the recurrent laryngeal nerve). V ocal cords can either bepartially paralyzed on one side or completely paralyzedon both sides.\nCauses and symptoms\nV ocal cord paralysis can result from injury, tumors,\nor surgery in the neck and upper chest. Brain tumors andstroke can also affect the nerves. Infectious diseases that\ndamage nerves—like whooping cough ,tetanus and\npolio—can also cause vocal cord paralysis. V ocal cordparalysis can also appear as a congenital defect. If con-genital, the most frequent cause is a brain defect, whichcan often be effectively treated. The most dangerous form of vocal cord paralysis is\none that affects the opening function, controlled by therecurrent laryngeal nerve. If both vocal cords are para-lyzed, breathing stops or becomes very labored. Fortunate-ly, injury during trauma or surgery often involves only oneside, but the congenital causes can damage both sides.\nV ocal cord paralysis produces several symptoms.\n• The voice is always affected; at best it is breathy and\nweak. At worst, it is not there at all. In infants, the crycan be weak. Older children will suppress laughing andcoughing because it is hard to do.\n• Swallowing may be hindered so that food ends up in\nthe airway, causing violent coughing and often leadingto pneumonia.\n• Breathing is obstructed on inspiration, producing a con-\ndition known as stridor . Closing the airway while\nbreathing in produces creaking noises in the throat andchanges the shape of the chest. The breast bone isdrawn inward, much more visibly in the flexible chestof a small child.\nDiagnosis\nThe voice box must be observed during breathing to\ncharacterize the problem. A viewing instrument called alaryngoscope, either flexible or rigid, is passed throughthe nose or throat until the cords becomes visible. Themotion of each cord can then be seen, and other prob-lems in the area identified. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3530Vocal cord paralysisX rays, CT, or MRI scans of the skull may be done if\na brain disorder is suspected.\nTreatment\nAn adequate airway is immediately necessary, usu-\nally secured with an endotracheal tube in the windpipe. Ifa cure cannot be achieved, a permanent breathing hole(tracheostomy) is cut in the neck. Brain problems that arerelieved within 24 hours usually allow the cords to regaintheir function. Care must be taken to assure that swallow-ing takes place normally. \nAlternative treatment\nV ocal cord paralysis can be addressed with constitu-\ntional homeopathy . This will work with the whole person,\nnot just the symptoms, to help bring about healing. Botani-cal medicine and deep tissue massage to the area can alsobring some resolution, although it may not be long term. \nResources\nBOOKS\nBallenger, John Jacob.

In 1926Dr. von Willebrand noticed that many male and femalemembers of a large family from the Aland Islands hadincreased bruising (bleeding into the skin) and prolongedepisodes of bleeding. The severity of the bleeding variedbetween family members and ranged from mild to severeand typically involved the mouth, nose, genital and uri-nary tracts, and occasionally the intestinal tract. Exces-sive bleeding during the menstrual period was also expe-rience by some of the women in this family. What differ-entiated this bleeding disorder from classical hemophilia\nwas that it appeared not to be associated with muscle andjoint bleeding and affected women and men rather thanjust men. Dr. von Willebrand named this disorder heredi-\ntary pseudohemophilia .\nPseudohemophilia, or von Willebrand disease\n(VWD) as it is now called, is caused when the body doesnot produce enough of a protein called von Willebrandfactor(vWF) or produces abnormal vWF. vWF is involvedin the process of blood clotting (coagulation). Blood clot-ting is necessary to heal an injury to a blood vessel. Whena blood vessel is injured, vWF enables blood cells calledplatelets to bind to the injured area and form a temporaryplug to seal the hole and stop the bleeding. vWF is secret-ed by platelets and by the cells that line the inner wall ofthe blood vessels (endothelial cells). The platelets releaseother chemicals, called factors, in response to a bloodvessel injury, which are involved in forming a strong per-manent clot. vWF binds to and stabilizes factor VIII, oneof the factors involved in forming the permanent clot.\nA deficiency or abnormality in vWF can interfere\nwith the formation of the temporary platelet plug andalso affect the normal survival of factor VIII, which canindirectly interfere with the production of the permanentclot. Individuals with VWD, therefore, have difficulty informing blood clots and as a result they may bleed forlonger periods of time. In most cases the bleeding is dueto an obvious injury, although it can sometimes occurspontaneously.\nVWD is classified into three basic types: type 1, 2,\nand 3 based on the amount and type of vWF that is pro-duced. Type 1 is the most common and mildest form andresults when the body produces slightly decreasedamounts of typically normal vWF. Type 2 can be classi-fied into five subtypes (A,B,M,N) and results when thebody produces an abnormal type of vWF. Type 3 is therarest and most severe form and results when the bodydoes not produce any detectable vWF.\nApproximately one out of 100 people are affected\nwith VWD, making it the most common inherited bleed-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3531von Willebrand diseaseing disorder (hemophilia). VWD affects people of all eth-\nnic backgrounds. Approximately 70–80% of people withVWD have type 1 and close to 20–30% have type 2.Type 3 is very rare and occurs in less than one percent ofpeople with VWD.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe genetics of VWD are complex and involve a\ngene that produces vWF and is found on chromosome12. Since we inherit two of each type of chromosome weinherit two vWF genes. There are different types ofchanges in the vWF gene that can affect the productionof vWF. Some types of changes can cause the vWF geneto produce decreased amounts of normal vWF, whileother changes can cause the gene to produce abnormalvWF. Most of the gene changes are significant enoughthat a change in only one vWF gene is sufficient to causeVWD. Some gene changes only cause VWD if bothgenes are changed, which often leads to more severesymptoms. Type 1 VWD is called an autosomal domi-nant condition since it is caused by a change in only onevWF gene. Since type 1 VWD results in only a slightdecrease in the amount of vWF produced, the symptomsare often mild and even non-existent in some patients.Most cases of Type 2 VWD are autosomal dominantsince they are caused by a change in only one vWF genethat results in the production of an abnormal protein. Anautosomal dominant form of VWD can be inherited fromeither parent or can occur spontaneously in the embryothat is formed when the egg and sperm cells cometogether during fertilization.\nSome cases of type 2 VWD and all cases of type 3\nVWD are autosomal recessive since they are caused bychanges in both vWF genes. A person with an autosomalrecessive form of VWD has inherited a changed genefrom his or her mother and a changed gene from his orher father. Parents who have a child with an autosomalrecessive form of VWD are called carriers, since theyeach possess one changed vWF gene and one unchangedvWF gene. Many carriers for the autosomal recessiveforms of type 2 VWD and type 3 VWD do not have anysymptoms, although some people with type 3 VWD areborn to parents who have type 1 VWD and may havesymptoms. Each child born to parents who are both carri-ers for VWD has a 25% chance of having VWD, a 50%chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being nei-ther a carrier nor affected with VWD disease. A personwith an autosomal dominant form of VWD has a 50%chance of passing the changed gene on to his or her chil-dren who may or may not have symptoms.\nVWD is usually a relatively mild disorder character-\nized by easy bruising, recurrent nosebleeds, heavy men-strual periods, and extended bleeding after surgeries and\ninvasive dental work. There is a great deal of variabilityin the severity of symptoms, which can range from clini-cally insignificant to life threatening. Even people withinthe same family who are affected with the same type ofVWD may exhibit different symptoms. An individualwith VWD may exhibit a range of symptoms over thecourse of his or her lifetime and may experience animprovement in symptoms with age. The severity of thedisease is partially related to the amount and type ofvWF that the body produces, but is also influenced byother genetic and non-genetic factors.\nType 1\nType 1, the mildest form of VWD, is usually associ-\nated with easy bruising, recurrent nosebleeds, heavymenstrual periods, and prolonged bleeding after surg-eries and invasive work. Many people with type 1 VWDdo not have any noticeable symptoms or only have pro-longed bleeding after surgery or significant trauma. Theamount of vWF produced by the body increases duringpregnancy , so prolonged bleeding during delivery is\nuncommon in people with type 1 VWD.\nType 2\nPeople with type 2 VWD usually have symptoms\nfrom early childhood and symptoms may even be presentat birth. They usually experience prolonged bleedingfrom cuts, easy bruising, nose bleeds, skin hematomas,and prolonged bleeding from the gums following teethextraction and minor trauma. More than 50% of womenwith type 2 VWD experience heavy periods that mayrequire a blood transfusion . Gastrointestinal bleeding is\nrare but can be life-threatening. Some women with type 2VWD exhibit prolonged bleeding during delivery.\nType 3\nType 3 VWD can be quite severe and is associated with\nbruising and bleeding from the mouth, nose, intestinal, geni-tal and urinary tracts. Type 3 is also associated with sponta-neous bleeding into the muscles and joints, which can resultin joint deformities. Some women with type 3 VWD experi-ence prolonged bleeding during delivery.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnostic testing\nMany people with VWD have mild symptoms or\nsymptoms that can be confused with other bleeding dis-orders making it difficult to diagnose VWD on the basisof clinical symptoms. VWD should be suspected in anyperson with a normal number of platelets in their blood\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3532von Willebrand diseaseand bleeding from the mucous membranes such as the\nnose, gums and gastrointestinal tract. Testing for an indi-vidual with suspected VWD often includes the measure-ment of:\n• how long it takes for the bleeding to stop after a tiny cut\nis made in the skin (the bleeding time )\n• the amount of vWF (vWF antigen measurement)• the activity of vWF (ristocetin co-factor activity)• the amount of factor VIII (factor VIII antigen measure-\nment)\n• activity of factor VIII\nPeople with type 1 VWD usually have an increased\nbleeding time but they may have an intermittently normalbleeding time. They also have a decreased amount ofvWF, and decreased vWF activity and usually haveslightly decreased factor VIII levels and activity. Peoplewith type 2 VWD have a prolonged bleeding time,decreased activity of vWF and may have decreasedamounts of vWF and factor VIII, and may havedecreased factor VIII activity. Type 3 individuals haveundetectable amounts of vWF, negligible vWF activity,factor VIII levels of less than 5–10%, and significantlyreduced factor VIII activity. The activity of vWF isreduced for all types of VWD, making it the most sensi-tive means of identifying all three types of VWD.Patients with borderline results should be tested two tothree times over a three month period.\nOnce a patient is diagnosed with VWD, further test-\ning such as vWF multimer analysis and ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) may need to be per-formed to determine the subtype. Multimer analysis eval-uates the structure of the vWF, and RIPA measures howmuch ristocetin is required to cause the clumping ofplatelets in a blood sample. The vWF multimer analysisis able to differentiate people with a structurally normalvWF (type 1) from people with a structurally abnormalvWF (type 2) and is often able to identify the subtype ofpatients with type 2 VWD. People with type 1 VWD usu-ally have normal to decreased RIPA concentrations.Depending on the subtype, patients with type 2 VWDeither have increased or decreased RIPA. RIPA is usuallyabsent and the multimer analysis shows undetectablevWF in people with type 3 VWD.\nIn some cases DNA testing can be a valuable adjunct\nto biochemical testing. The detection of gene alteration(s)can confirm a diagnosis and can determine the type andsubtype of VWD. It can also help to facilitate prenataltesting and testing of other family members. Unfortunate-ly, as of 2001, many people with VWD possess DNAchanges that are not detectable through DNA testing. Aperson who has a mother, father, or sibling diagnosedwith VWD should undergo biochemical testing for VWD.\nIf the relative with VWD possesses a detectable genechange, then DNA testing should also be considered.\nPrenatal testing\nIf one parent has been diagnosed with an autosomal\ndominant form of VWD or both parents are carriers for anautosomal recessive form of VWD, then prenatal testingcan be considered. If the parent with an autosomal domi-nant form of VWD possesses a detectable gene change orboth parents who are carriers for an autosomal recessiveform of VWD possess detectable mutations, then DNAtesting of their fetus would be available. DNA testing canbe performed through amniocentesis or chorionic villus\nsampling . If the DNA change in the parent(s) is unknown\nthen prenatal testing can sometimes be performed throughbiochemical testing of blood obtained from the fetalumbilical cord, which is less accurate and is associatedwith a higher risk of pregnancy loss.\nTreatment\nVWD is most commonly treated by replacement of\nvWF through the administration of blood products thatcontain vWF or through treatment with desmopressin(DDA VP, 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin). DDA VPfunctions by increasing the amount of factor VIII andvWF in the bloodstream. Treatment with blood productsor DDA VP may be started in response to uncontrollablebleeding or may be administered prior to proceduressuch as surgeries or dental work. The type of treatmentchosen depends on the type of VWD and a patient’sresponse to a preliminary treatment trial.\nTreatment with desmopressin\nDDA VP is the most common treatment for people\nwith type 1 VWD. About 80% of people with type 1VWD respond to DDA VP therapy. Treatment withDDA VP can also be used to treat some people with type2 VWD. Patients with Type 2B VWD should not be treat-ed with this medication since DDA VP can induce dan-gerous platelet clumping. Type 3 VWD should not betreated with DDA VP since this medication does notincrease the level of vWF in type 3 patients. DDA VPshould only be used in people who have been shown tobe responsive through a pre-treatment trial transfusionwith this medication.\nDDA VP can be administered intravenously or\nthrough a nasal inhaler. DDA VP has relatively few sideeffects although some people may experience facialflushing, tingling sensations, and headaches after treat-ment with this medication. Often treatment with this\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3533von Willebrand diseasemedication is only required prior to invasive surgeries or\ndental procedures.\nTreatment with blood products\nPatients who are unable to tolerate or are unrespon-\nsive to drug-based treatments are treated with concentrat-KEY TERMS\nAmniocentesis —A procedure performed at 16-18\nweeks of pregnancy in which a needle is insertedthrough a woman’s abdomen into her uterus todraw out a small sample of the amniotic fluid fromaround the baby.

    "title": "Vulvar cancer",
    "content": "Vulvar cancer\nDefinition\nVulvar cancer refers to an abnormal, cancerous\ngrowth in the external female genitalia.\nDescription\nVulvar cancer is a rare disease that occurs mainly in\nelderly women. The vulva refers to the external femalegenitalia, which includes the labia, the opening of thevagina, the clitoris, and the space between the vagina andanus (perineum). There are two pairs of labia (a Latinterm meaning lips). The labia meet to protect the open-ings of the vagina and the tube that connects to the blad-der (urethra). The outer, most prominent folds of skin arecalled labia majora, and the smaller, inner skin folds arecalled labia minora. Vulvar cancer can affect any part ofthe female genitalia, but usually affects the labia.\nApproximately 70% of vulvar cancers involve the\nlabia (usually the labia majora), 15% to 20% involve theclitoris, and 15% to 20% involve the perineum. Forapproximately 5% of the cases, the cancer is present atmore than one location. For approximately 10% of thecases, so much of the vulva is affected by cancer that theoriginal location cannot be determined. Vulvar cancer\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3535Vulvar cancercan spread to nearby structures including the anus, vagi-\nna, and urethra.\nMost vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.\nSquamous cells are the main cell type of the skin. Squa-mous cell carcinoma often begins at the edges of thelabia majora or labia minora or the area around the vagi-na. This type of cancer is usually slow-growing and maybegin with a precancerous condition referred to as vul-var intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), or dysplasia. Thismeans that precancerous cells are present in the surfacelayer of skin.\nOther, less common types of vulvar cancer are\nmelanoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinomas,Paget’s disease of the vulva, and tumors of the connec-tive tissue under the skin. Melanoma, a cancer that devel-ops from the cells that produce the pigment that deter-mines the skin’s color, can occur anywhere on the skin,including the vulva. Melanoma is the second most com-mon type of vulvar cancer, and accounts for 5% to 10%of the cases. Half of all vulvar melanomas involve thelabia majora. Basal cell carcinoma, which is the mostcommon type of cancer that occurs on parts of the skinexposed to the sun, very rarely occurs on the vulva. Ade-nocarcinomas develop from glands, including the glandsat the opening of the vagina (Bartholin’s glands) that pro-duce a mucus-like lubricating fluid.\nVulvar cancer is most common in women over 50\nyears of age. The median age at diagnosis is 65 to 70years old. Additional risk factors for vulvar cancerinclude having multiple sexual partners, cervical cancer ,\nand the presence of chronic vaginal and vulvar inflam-mations. This type of cancer is often associated with sex-\nually transmitted diseases .\nVulvar cancer is most common in women who are\nbetween the ages of 65 and 75 years. In the United Statesthere are approximately 3,000 new cases of vulvar cancerdiagnosed each year. Vulvar cancer accounts for only 1%of all cancers in women. Approximately 5% of all gyne-cologic cancers occur on the vulva. For unknown rea-sons, the incidence of vulvar cancer seems to be rising.\nCauses and symptoms\nCancer is caused when the normal mechanisms that\ncontrol cell growth become disturbed, causing the cellsto continually grow without stopping. This is usually theresult of damage to the DNA in the cell. Although thecause of vulvar cancer is unknown, studies have identi-fied several risk factors for vulvar cancer. These include:\n• Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). This abnormal\ngrowth of the surface cells of the vulva can sometimesprogress to cancer.• Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). This virus\nis sexually transmitted and can cause genital warts .\nAlthough HPV DNA can be detected in most cases ofvulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, it is detected in fewerthan half of all cases of vulvar cancer. Therefore, thelink between HPV infection and vulvar cancer isunclear. As of 2001, it is theorized that two classes ofvulvar cancer exist: one that is associated with HPVinfection and one that is not.\n• Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2). This sexually transmit-\nted virus is also associated with increased risk for vul-var cancer.\n• Cigarette smoking . Smoking in combination with\ninfection by HPV or HSV2 was found to be a particu-larly strong risk factor for vulvar cancer.\n• Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nThis virus, which causes AIDS , decreases the body’s\nimmune ability, leaving it vulnerable to a variety of dis-eases, including vulvar cancer.\n• Chronic vulvar inflammation. Long term irritation and\ninflammation of the vulva and vagina, which may becaused by poor hygiene, can increase the risk of vulvarcancer.\n• Abnormal Pap smears. Women who have had abnormal\nPap smears are at an increased risk of developing vul-var cancer.\n• Chronic immunosuppression. Women who have had\nlong-term suppression of their immune system causedby disease (such as certain cancers) or medication (suchas those taken after organ transplantation) have anincreased risk of developing vulvar cancer.\nThe hallmark symptom of vulvar cancer is itching\n(pruritus), which is experienced by 90% of the womenafflicted by this cancer. The cancerous lesion is readilyvisible. Unfortunately, because of embarrassment ordenial, it is not uncommon for women to delay medicalassessment of vulvar abnormalities. Any abnormalitiesshould be reported to a gynecologist.\nIf squamous cell vulvar cancer is present, it may\nappear as a raised red, pink, or white bump (nodule). It isoften accompanied by pain , bleeding, vaginal discharge,\nand painful urination. Malignant melanoma of the\nvulva usually appears as a pigmented, ulcerated growth.Other types of vulvar cancer may appear as a distinctmass of tissue, sore and scaly areas, or cauliflower-likegrowths that look like warts .\nDiagnosis\nA gynecological examination will be used to\nobserve the suspected area. During this examination, the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3536Vulvar cancerphysician may use a special magnifying instrument\ncalled a colposcope to view the area better. Additionally,the area may be treated with a dilute solution of aceticacid, which causes some abnormal areas to turn white,making them easier to see. During this examination, ifany area is suspected of being abnormal, a tissue sample(biopsy) will be taken. The biopsy can be performed inthe doctor’s office with the use of local anesthetic. Awedge-shaped piece of tissue, which contains the suspectlesion with some surrounding normal skin and the under-lying skin layers and connective tissue, will be removed.Small lesions will be removed in their entirety (excision-al biopsy). The diagnosis of cancer depends on a micro-scopic analysis of this tissue by a pathologist.\nThe diagnosis for vulvar cancer will determine how\nadvanced the cancer is and how much it has spread. Thisis determined by the size of the tumor and how deep ithas invaded the surrounding tissue and organs, such asthe lymph nodes. It will also be determined if the cancerhas metastasized, or spread to other organs. Tests used todetermine the extent of the cancer include x ray and com-puted tomography scan (CT scan). Endoscopic examina-tion of the bladder ( cystoscopy ) and/or rectum (proc-\ntoscopy) may be performed if it is suspected that the can-cer has spread to these organs.\nTreatment\nClinical staging\nThe International Federation of Gynecology and\nObstetrics (FIGO) has adopted a surgical staging systemfor vulvar cancer. The stage of cancer is determined aftersurgery. The previous clinical staging system for vulvarcancer is no longer used. Vulvar cancer is categorizedinto five stages (0, I, II, III, and IV) which may be furthersubdivided (A and B) based on the depth or spread ofcancerous tissue. The FIGO stages for vulvar cancer are:\n• Stage 0. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.• Stage I. Cancer is confined to the vulva and perineum.\nThe lesion is less than 2 cm (about 0.8 in) in size.\n• Stage II. Cancer is confined to the vulva and perineum.\nThe lesion is larger than 2 cm (larger than 0.8 in) in size.\n• Stage III. Cancer has spread to the vagina, urethra, anus,\nand/or the lymph nodes in the groin (inguinofemoral).\n• Stage IV . Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, pelvic\nbone, pelvic lymph nodes, and/or other parts of the body.\nTreatments\nTreatment for vulvar cancer will depend on its stage\nand the patient’s general state of health. Surgery is themainstay of treatment for most cases of vulvar cancer.SURGERY. The primary treatment for stage I and\nstage II vulvar cancer is surgery to remove the cancerouslesion and possibly the inguinofemoral lymph nodes.Removal of the lesion may be done by laser, to burn off aminimal amount of tissue, or by scalpel (local excision),to remove more of the tissue. The choice will depend onthe severity of the cancer. If a large area of the vulva isremoved, it is called a vulvectomy. Radical vulvectomyremoves the entire vulva. A vulvectomy may require skingrafts from other areas of the body to cover the woundand make an artificial vulva. Because of the significantmorbidity and the psychosexual consequences of radicalvulvectomy, there is a trend toward minimizing theextent of cancer excision. The specific inguinofemorallymph node that would receive lymph fluid from the can-cerous lesion, known as the sentinel node, may beexposed for examination (lymph node dissection) orremoved (lymphadenectomy), especially in cases inwhich the cancerous lesion has invaded to a depth ofmore than 1 mm. Surgery may also be followed bychemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to kill addi-\ntional cancer cells.\nSurgical treatment of stage III and stage IV vulvar\ncancer is much more complex. Extensive surgery wouldbe necessary to completely remove the cancerous tissue.Surgery would involve excision of pelvic organs (pelvicexenteration), radical vulvectomy, and lymphadenecto-my. Because this extensive surgery comes with a sub-stantial risk of complications, it may be possible to treatadvanced vulvar cancer with minimal surgery by usingradiation therapy and/or chemotherapy as additionaltreatment (adjuvant therapy).\nAn intraoperative technique that is used to identify\nthe sentinel node in breast cancer and melanoma is\nbeing applied to vulvar cancer. This technique, calledlymphoscintigraphy, is performed during surgical treat-ment of vulvar cancer and allows the surgeon to immedi-ately identify the sentinel node. A radioactive compound(technetium 99m sulfur colloid) is injected into the can-cerous lesion approximately two hours prior to surgery.This injection causes little discomfort, so local anesthe-sia is not required. During surgery, a radioactivity detec-tor is used to locate the sentinel node and any other nodesto which cancer has spread. Though still in the experi-mental stage, vulvar lymphoscintigraphy shows promisein reducing morbidity and hospital length of stay.\nThe most common complication of vulvectomy is\nthe development of a tumor-like collection of clear liquid(wound seroma). Other surgical complications includeurinary tract infection, wound infection, temporary nerveinjury, fluid accumulation ( edema ) in the legs, urinary\nincontinence , falling or sinking of the genitals (genital\nprolapse), and blood clots (thrombus).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3537Vulvar cancerRADIATION THERAPY. Radiation therapy uses high-\nenergy radiation from x rays and gamma rays to kill thecancer cells. The skin in the treated area may become redand dry and may take as long as a year to return to normal.Fatigue , upset stomach, diarrhea , and nausea are also\ncommon complaints of women having radiation therapy.Radiation therapy in the pelvic area may cause the vaginato become narrow as scar tissue forms. This phenomenon,known as vaginal stenosis, makes intercourse painful.\nCHEMOTHERAPY. Chemotherapy uses anticancer\ndrugs to kill the cancer cells. The drugs are given by mouth\n(orally) or intravenously. They enter the bloodstream andcan travel to all parts of the body to kill cancer cells. Gener-ally, a combination of drugs is given because it is moreeffective than a single drug in treating cancer. The sideeffects of chemotherapy are significant and include stomachupset, vomiting, appetite loss, hair loss, mouth or vaginalsores, fatigue, menstrual cycle changes, and premature\nmenopause . There is also an increased chance of infections.\nAlternative treatment\nAlthough alternative and complementary therapies\nare used by many cancer patients, very few controlledKEY TERMS\nAdjuvant therapy —A treatment that is intended to\naid primary treatment. Adjuvant treatments forvulvar cancer are radiation therapy andchemotherapy.\nBiopsy —Removal of a small piece of tissue for\nmicroscopic examination. This is done under localanesthesia and removed by either using a scalpelor a punch, which removes a small cylindricalportion of tissue.\nColposcope —An instrument used for examination\nof the vagina and cervix. Part of the instrumentincludes a magnifying lens for better visualization.\nMetastasis —The movement of cancer cells from\none area of the body to another. This occursthrough the blood vessels or the lymph vessels.\nPelvic exenteration —Surgical removal of the\norgans of the true pelvis which includes theuterus, vagina, and cervix.\nSentinel lymph node —The first lymph node to\nreceive lymph fluid from a tumor. If the sentinelnode is cancer-free, then it is likely that the can-cerous cells have not metastasized.studies on the effectiveness of such therapies exist.\nMind-body techniques such as prayer, biofeedback ,\nvisualization, meditation , and yoga have not shown any\neffect in reducing cancer but can reduce stress and lessen\nsome of the side effects of cancer treatments. Clinicalstudies of hydrazine sulfate found that it had no effect oncancer and even worsened the health and well- being ofthe study subjects. One clinical study of the drug amyg-dalin (Laetrile) found that it had no effect on cancer.Laetrile can be toxic and has caused death . Shark carti-\nlage, although highly touted as an effective cancer treat-ment, is an improbable therapy that has not been the sub-ject of clinical study.\nThe American Cancer Society has found that the\n“metabolic diets” pose serious risk to the patient. Theeffectiveness of the macrobiotic, Gerson, and Kelleydiets and the Manner metabolic therapy has not been sci-\nentifically proven. The FDA was unable to substantiatethe anticancer claims made about the popular Cancelltreatment.\nThere is no evidence for the effectiveness of most\nover-the-counter herbal cancer remedies. However, someherbals have shown an anticancer effect. As shown inclinical studies, Polysaccharide krestin, from the mush-room Coriolus versicolor , has significant effectiveness\nagainst cancer. In a small study, the green alga Chlorella\npyrenoidosa has been shown to have anticancer activity.\nIn a few small studies, evening primrose oil has shownsome benefit in the treatment of cancer.\nPrognosis\nFactors that are correlated with disease outcome\ninclude the diameter and depth of the cancerous lesion,involvement of local lymph nodes, cell type, HPV status,and age of the patient. Vulvar cancers that are HPV posi-tive have a better prognosis than those that are HPV nega-tive. The 5-year survival rate is 98% for stage I vulvar can-cer and 87% for stage II vulvar cancer. The survival ratedrops steadily as the number of affected lymph nodesincreases. The survival rate is 75% for patients with one ortwo, 36% for those with three or four, and 24% for thosewith five or six involved lymph nodes. The previous statis-tics were obtained from studies of patients who receivedsurgical treatment only and cannot be used to determinesurvival rates when adjuvant therapy is employed.\nVulvar cancer can spread locally to encompass the\nanus, vagina, and urethra. Because of the anatomy of thevulva, it is not uncommon for the cancer to spread to thelocal lymph nodes. Advanced stages of vulvar cancer canaffect the pelvic bone. The lungs are the most commonsite for vulvar cancer metastasis. Metastasis through theblood (hematogenous spread) is uncommon.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3538Vulvar cancerPrevention\nThe risk of vulvar cancer can be decreased by avoid-\ning risk factors, most of which involve lifestyle choices.Specifically, to reduce the risk of vulvar cancer, womenshould not smoke and should refrain from engaging inunsafe sexual behavior. Good hygiene of the genital areato prevent infection and inflammation may also reducethe risk of vulvar cancer.\nBecause vulvar cancer is highly curable in its early\nstages, women should consult a physician as soon as avulvar abnormality is detected. Regular gynecologicalexaminations are necessary to detect precancerous condi-tions that can be treated before the cancer becomes inva-sive. Because some vulvar cancer is a type of skin can-cer, the American Cancer Society also recommends self-examination of the vulva using a mirror. If moles are pre-\nsent in the genital area, women should employ theABCD rule:\n• Asymmetry. A cancerous mole may have two halves of\nunequal size.\n• Border irregularity. A cancerous mole may have ragged\nor notched edges.\n• Color. A cancerous mole may have variations in color.\n• Diameter. A cancerous mole may have a diameter wider\nthan 6 mm (1/4 in).\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Cancer Society’s Guide to Complementary and\nAlternative Cancer Methods.

    "title": "Vulvovaginitis",
    "content": "Vulvovaginitis\nDefinition\nInflammation of the vagina and vulva most often\ncaused by a bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection.\nDescription\nVulvovaginitis, vulvitis, and vaginitis are general\nterms that refer to the inflammation of the vagina and/orvulva (the external genital organs of a woman).Theseconditions can be caused by bacterial, fungal, or parasiticinfections. Also, vulvovaginitis can be caused by lowestrogen levels (called “atrophic vaginitis”) or any typeof allergic or irritation response from things such as sper-micidal products, condoms, soaps, and bubble bath.\nIn general, vulvovaginitis causes vaginal discharge,\nirritation, and itching . One of the most common reasons\nwhy women visit their doctor is because of a change invaginal discharge. It is completely normal for a womanto have a vaginal discharge, the amount and consistencyof which varies during the course of the menstrual cycle.Each of the three most common types of vulvovaginitiswill be described separately. \nBacterial vaginosis\nBacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of\nvaginitis during the childbearing years. Forty percent to50% of vaginitis cases are caused by bacterial vaginosis.The occurrence of bacterial vaginosis is difficult to deter-mine but studies have proposed that 10% to 41% of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3539Vulvovaginitiswomen have had it at least once. The occurrence of bacter-\nial vaginosis in the United States is highest amongAfrican-American women and women who have had mul-tiple sexual partners and lowest among Asian women andwomen with no history of sexual contact with men. Bacte-rial vaginosis is not considered a sexually transmitted dis-ease although it can be acquired by sexual intercourse.\nBacterial vaginosis is not caused by a particular\norganism but is a change in the balance of normal vaginalbacteria. Ninety percent of the bacteria found in ahealthy vagina belong to the Lactobacillus family. For\nunknown reasons, there is a shift in the bacterial popula-tion that results in overgrowth of other bacteria. Patientssuffering from bacterial vaginosis have very high num-bers of bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis ,\nMycoplasmahominis ,Bacteroides species, and Mobilun-\ncusspecies. These bacteria can be found at numbers 100\nto 1000 times greater than found in the healthy vagina. Incontrast, Lactobacillus bacteria are in very low numbers\nor completely absent from the vagina of women withbacterial vaginosis.\nCandida vulvovaginitis\nCandida vulvovaginitis also has been called “vulvo-\nvaginal candidiasis,” “candidal vaginitis,” “monilialinfection,” or “vaginal yeast infection.” Twenty to 25%of the vaginitis cases are candida vulvovaginitis. It hasbeen estimated that about 75% of all women get a vagi-nal yeast infection at least once. In 80-90% of the cases,candida vulvovaginitis is caused by an overgrowth of theyeast Candida albicans . The remaining cases are caused\nby other species of Candida . It is not known what causes\nthe yeast overgrowth. However, antibiotics can inadver-\ntently kill normal bacteria in the vagina and cause anovergrowth of Candida.\nCandida vulvovaginitis is not considered a sexually\ntransmitted disease because Candida species are com-\nmonly found in the healthy vagina. It is a rare disease ingirls before puberty and celibate women. Vaginal yeast\ninfections tend to occur more frequently in women whoare pregnant, diabetic and not controlling their disease,taking birth control pills, or taking antibiotics. Somewomen have four or more attacks per year which iscalled “recurrent vaginal candidiasis.”\nTrichomoniasis\nTrichomoniasis , which is sometimes called “trich,”\naccounts for 15-20% of the cases of vaginitis. It is esti-mated that two million to three million American womenget trichomoniasis each year. Unlike the previous twocauses of vulvovaginitis, trichomoniasis is a sexuallytransmitted disease. This means that the disease is passedfrom person-to-person only by sexual contact. Trichomo-\nniasis occurs in both men and women and is caused by aninfection with the single-celled parasite Trichomonas\nvaginalis . Infection with Trichomonas vaginalis is fre-\nquently associated with other sexually transmitted dis-\neases and assists the spread of the AIDS virus.\nCauses and symptoms\nVulvovaginitis is most often caused by a bacterial,\nfungal, or parasitic infection as described above. Othermicroorganisms may cause vulvovaginitis, or it may becaused by allergic reaction, irritation, injury, low estrogenlevels, and certain diseases. Risk factors for bacterial vagi-nosis include using an intrauterine device ( IUD), non-\nwhite race, prior pregnancy , first sexual activity at an\nearly age, having multiple sexual partners, and having ahistory of sexually transmitted diseases. Persons at anincreased risk for candida vulvovaginitis include thosewho have had previous candida infections, frequent sexualintercourse, use birth control pills, have AIDS, are preg-nant, are taking antibiotics or corticosteroids , are diabetic,\nuse douches, use perfumed feminine hygiene sprays, weartight clothing, or use vaginal sponges or an IUD.\nThe typical symptoms of vulvovaginitis are: vaginal\ndischarge, itching, and irritation. Women may have fewor no symptoms, while others may have pronouncedsymptoms. The main symptom of bacterial vaginosis is afishy-smelling, thin, milky-white or gray vaginal dis-charge but itching and burning may also be present. Thefishy smell is stronger after sexual intercourse. Thesymptoms of candida vulvovaginitis are itching, sore-ness, painful sexual intercourse, and a thick, curdy, white(like cottage cheese) vaginal discharge. Trichomoniasissymptoms are: painful urination, painful sexual inter-course, and a yellow-green to gray, foul smelling, some-times frothy, vaginal discharge.\nDiagnosis\nVulvovaginitis can be diagnosed and treated by a\nnurse practitioner or physician. Most insurance compa-nies cover the costs of diagnosis and treatment. To diag-nose vulvovaginitis, the doctor will examine the vagina(using a speculum to keep the vagina open) and take asample of the vaginal discharge for tests and microscopicanalysis. Laboratory culture results should be availablein two to three days but the microscopic examination ofthe vaginal discharge may be immediately performed inthe doctor’s office. Diagnosis may be difficult becausethere are many different causes of vulvovaginitis.Women who think that they have vulvovaginitis shouldalways visit their doctor to get an accurate diagnosis.Many women assume that they have a yeast infection and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3540Vulvovaginitistake over-the-counter medicines without first consulting\ntheir doctors.\nThere are four signs that indicate that a woman has\nbacterial vaginosis. These signs (called “Amsel’s crite-ria”) are: a thin, milky white discharge that clings to thewalls of the vagina, presence of a fishy odor, a vaginalpH of greater than 4.5, and the presence of “clue cells” inthe vagina. Clue cells are vaginal cells that are coveredwith small bacteria. A diagnosis of candida vulvovagini-tis is made after finding a normal vaginal pH (4 to 4.5)and the presence of many yeast cells in the sample ofvaginal discharge or growth of yeast on laboratorymedia. A trichomoniasis diagnosis is made when the par-asites are found in the vaginal discharge either by micro-scopic examination or in laboratory cultures.\nTreatment\nBoth bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis require\nprescription medication for treatment. Candida vulvo-vaginitis may be treated with either prescription or over-the-counter medicines. It is not advisable to take over-the-counter vaginal yeast infection medicines if one doesnot have a yeast infection. An Institute of Epidemiologi-cal Research survey of 390 gynecologists found that 44%of the women who were diagnosed with bacterial vagi-nosis had first treated themselves with over-the-counteryeast infection medications.\nBacterial vaginosis should be treated daily for one\nweek with the antibiotics metronidazole (Flagyl, Proto-stat) or clindamycin (Cleocin) either as pills taken orallyor in a gel or cream form put into the vagina. Trichomo-niasis is treated with either a large, single dose ofmetronidazole or with a smaller dose taken twice dailyfor one week. Male sexual partners of women with tri-chomoniasis also must be treated.\nCandida vulvovaginitis is most often treated by the\napplication of medicated gels, creams, or suppositoriesapplied directly to the vagina. The antifungal drugs usedto treat candida vulvovaginitis include oral fluconazole(Diflucan), butoconazole (Femstat), clotrimazole (Gyne-lotrimin, Mycelex), miconazole (Monistat), and ticona-zole (Vagistat). Most require only one or a few days oftherapy to be effective. Women who have recurrent candi-da infections may receive treatment for several weeks andthen some form of a long-term preventative treatment.\nAlternative treatment\nOne of the primary focuses of alternative treatment\nfor vaginal conditions including vulvovaginitis is rebal-ancing the normal vaginal flora. To assist with this rebal-ancing, Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bifidus are rec-\nommended, either taken internally or introduced directlyKEY TERMS\nParasite —An animal or plant that can only survive\nby living inside or upon another animal or plant.\nVulva —The external genital organs of a woman,\nincluding the outer and inner lips, clitoris, andopening of the vagina.\ninto the vagina. Garlic ( Allium sativum ), both taken inter-\nnally and inserted into the vagina (a peeled whole clovewrapped in gauze), may be helpful due to its antibacterialand antifungal actions. A variety of other herbs can beused as douches or in suppository form to help treat acuteflare-ups of vaginal symptoms. For example a douchemade by steeping 1–2 tsp. of calendula ( Calendula offici-\nnalis ) in boiling water (let the water cool before using)\nmay help reduce inflammation. A boric acid douche canhelp to acidify the vaginal pH so that unwanted bacteriacannot survive and multiply. For atrophic vaginitis, espe-cially in menopausal women, topical application of prog-esterone cream can help with the thinning of the tissue sothat symptoms can abate. \nDietary modification and nutritional supplementation\nmay also be helpful in the treatment of vulvovaginitis.Antioxidant vitamins , including A, C, and E, as well as B\ncomplex vitamins, and vitamin D, are recommended.Foods to avoid include cheese, alcohol, chocolate, soysauce, sugar, vinegar, fruits, and any fermented foods.Wearing cotton underwear and loose fitting clothes andavoiding panty hose can help keep the vagina cool anddry, thus helping to prevent some forms of vulvovaginitis.Cases of chronic vulvovaginitis should be addressed onsystemic level by an alternative practitioner.\nPrognosis\nVulvovaginitis is a disease with minor symptoms\nand most women respond well to medications. It isbelieved that certain vaginal infections, if left untreated,can lead to more serious conditions such as pelvic\ninflammatory disease , endometritis, postsurgical infec-\ntions, and spread of the AIDS virus.\nPrevention\nVaginal infections may be prevented by following\nthese suggestions:\n• Over-the-counter yeast infection treatments should not\nbe taken unless the woman had been diagnosed withcandidiasis before and recognizes the symptoms. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3541Vulvovaginitis• Douching should be avoided because it may disturb the\nbalance of organisms in the vagina and may spreadthem higher into the reproductive system.\n• Thoroughly dry oneself after bathing and remove a wet\nbathing suit promptly. \n• Avoid wearing tight clothing and wear cotton under-\nwear.\n• Clean diaphragms, cervical caps, and spermicide appli-\ncators after use. Use condoms to avoid sexually trans-mitted disease.\n• After a bowel movement, wipe from front to back to\navoid spreading intestinal bacteria to the vagina.Resources\nPERIODICALS\nSobel, Jack D. “Vaginitis.” The New England Journal of Medi-\ncine 337 (Dec. 1997): 1896-1903.\nORGANIZATIONS\nNational Vaginitis Association. 117 South Cook St., Suite 315,\nBarrington, IL 60010.

It was first identified in 1944, bythe Swedish physician Jan Gosta Waldenström, inpatients who had a thickening of the serum, or liquidpart, of the blood. Their blood serum contained a greatdeal of a very large molecule called a globulin. Thus, thedisorder is called macroglobulinemia.\nLymphomas are cancers that originate in tissues of the\nlymphatic system. All lymphomas other than Hodgkin’s\ndisease , including WM, are known collectively as non-\nHodgkin’s lymphomas. There are 13 major types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and others that are very rare. Othernames that are sometimes used for WM include: lympho-plasmacytic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic leukemia,macroglobulinemia of Waldenström, primary macroglobu-linemia, Waldenström’s syndrome, Waldenström’s purpu-ra, or hyperglobulinemic purpura. Purpura refers to purplespots on the skin, resulting from the frequent bleeding andbruising that can be a symptom of WM.\nWM is classified as a low-grade or indolent form of\nlymphoma because it is a slow-growing cancer that pro-duces fewer symptoms than other types of lymphomas.WM most often affects males over the age of 65. Fre-quently, this disease produces no symptoms and does notrequire treatment. It has not been studied as extensivelyas other types of lymphoma.\nThe lymphatic system\nThe lymphatic system is part of the body’s immune\nsystem, for fighting disease, and part of the blood-pro-ducing system. It includes the lymph vessels and nodes,and the spleen, bone marrow, and thymus. The narrowlymphatic vessels carry lymphatic fluid from throughoutthe body. The lymph nodes are small, pea-shaped organsthat filter the lymphatic fluid and trap foreign substances,including viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. The spleen,in the upper left abdomen, removes old cells and debrisfrom the blood. The bone marrow, the spongy tissueinside the bones, produces new blood cells.\nB lymphocytes or B cells are white blood cells that\nrecognize disease-causing organisms. They circulatethroughout the body in the blood and lymphatic fluid.Each B lymphocyte recognizes a specific foreign sub-stance, or antigen. When it encounters its specific anti-gen, the B cell begins to divide and multiply, producinglarge numbers of identical (monoclonal), mature plasmacells. These plasma cells produce large amounts of anti-body that are specific for the antigen. Antibodies arelarge proteins called immunoglobulins (Igs) that bind toand remove the specific antigen.\nA type of Ig, called IgM, is part of the early immune\nresponse. The IgM molecules form clusters in the blood-stream. When these IgM clusters encounter their specificantigen, usually a bacterium, they cover it so that it canbe destroyed by other immune system cells.\nPlasma cell neoplasm\nWM is a type of plasma cell neoplasm or B-cell\nlymphoma. These are lymphomas in which certain plas-ma cells become abnormal, or cancerous, and begin togrow uncontrollably. In WM, the cancerous plasma cellsW\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3543overproduce large amounts of identical (monoclonal)\nIgM antibody. This IgM also is called M protein, formonoclonal or myeloma protein.\nMacroglobulinemia refers to the accumulation of\nthis M protein in the serum of the blood. This largeamount of M protein can cause the blood to thicken,causing hyperviscosity. The malignant plasma cells ofsome WM patients also produce and secrete partialimmunoglobulins called light chains, or Bence-Jonesproteins. The malignant plasma cells can invade varioustissues, including the bone marrow, lymph nodes, andspleen, causing these tissues to swell.\nWM accounts for about 1-2% of non-Hodgkin’s\nlymphomas. It is estimated that it may affect about fiveout of every 100,000 people. It usually affects peopleover the age of 50, and most often develops after age65. It is more common in men than in women. In theUnited States, WM is more common among Caucasiansthan among African Americans. The disease can run infamilies.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of WM is not known.\nMany individuals with WM have no symptoms of\nthe disease. This is known as asymptomatic macroglobu-linemia. When symptoms of WM are present, they mayvary greatly from one individual to the next.\nHyperviscosity syndrome\nAt least 50% of individuals with WM have hypervis-\ncosity syndrome, an increased viscosity or thickening ofthe blood caused by the accumulation of IgM in theserum. Hyperviscosity can cause a slowing in the circula-tion through small blood vessels. This condition can leadto a variety of symptoms:\n•fatigue\n• weakness• rash\n• bruising\n• nose bleeds• gastrointestinal bleeding• weight loss\n• night sweats\n• increased and recurrent infections• poor blood circulation in the extremities\nPoor blood circulation, or Raynaud’s phenomenon,\ncan affect any part of the body, but particularly the fin-gers, toes, nose, and ears.Cold weather can cause additional circulatory prob-\nlems, by further thickening the blood and slowing downcirculation. In some cases, the excess blood protein mayprecipitate out of the blood in the cold, creating particlesthat can block small blood vessels. This is called cryo-globulinemia. The extremities may turn white, or apatchy red and white. The hands, feet, fingers, toes, ears,and nose may feel cold, numb, or painful.\nHyperviscosity may affect the brain and nervous\nsystem, leading to additional symptoms. These symp-toms include:\n• peripheral neuropathy, caused by changes in the nerves,\nleading to pain or numbness in the extremities\n• dizziness\n• headaches• vision problems or loss of vision• mental confusion• poor coordination• temporary paralysis• mental changes\nHyperviscosity can clog the tubules that form the fil-\ntering system of the kidneys, leading to kidney damageor kidney failure. Existing heart conditions can be aggra-vated by WM. In extreme cases, WM may result in heart\nfailure . Late-stage WM also may lead to mental changes\nthat can progress to coma .\nAnemia\nThe accumulation of IgM in the blood causes an\nincrease in the volume of the blood plasma. This effec-tively dilutes out the red blood cells and other bloodcomponents. The lowered concentration of red bloodcells can lead to anemia and cause serious fatigue. Like-wise, a deficiency in platelets ( thrombocytopenia ),\nwhich cause the blood to clot, can result in easy bleedingand bruising. As the cancer progresses, there may beabnormal bleeding from the gums, nose, mouth, andintestinal tract. There may be bluish discoloration of theskin. In the later stages of the disease, leukopenia, a defi-ciency in white blood cells, also can develop.\nOrgan involvement\nIn 5-10% of WM cases, the IgM may be deposited in\ntissues. Thus, some individuals with WM have enlarge-ment of the lymph nodes, the spleen, and/or the liver.\nIf Bence-Jones proteins are produced by the malig-\nnant plasma cells, they may be deposited in the kidneys.There they can plug up the tiny tubules that form the fil-tering system of the kidneys. This can lead to kidneydamage and kidney failure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3544Waldenström’s macroglobulinemiaDiagnosis\nSince many individuals with WM have no symp-\ntoms, the initial diagnosis may result from blood teststhat are performed for some other purpose.

In this procedure, a needle is insertedinto a bone and a small amount of marrow is removed.Microscopic examination of the marrow may reveal ele-vated levels of lymphocytes and plasma cells. However,less than 5% of patients with WM have lytic bonelesions, caused by cancerous plasma cells in the bonemarrow that are destroying healthy cells. Bone lesionscan be detected with x rays.\nTreatment\nClinical staging, to define how far a cancer has\nspread through the body, is the common method forchoosing a cancer treatment. However, there is no gener-ally-accepted staging system for WM.\nThere also is no generally-accepted course of treat-\nment for WM. Treatment may not be necessary forasymptomatic macroglobulinemia. However, if IgMserum levels are very high, treatment may be initiatedeven in the absence of symptoms. If symptoms are pre-sent, treatment is directed at relieving symptoms andretarding the disease’s development. Of major concern isthe prevention or alleviation of blood hyperviscosity.Therefore, the initial treatment depends on the viscosityof the blood at diagnosis.\nHyperviscosity\nPlasmapheresis , or plasma exchange transfusion ,i s\na procedure for thinning the blood. In this treatment,blood is removed and passed through a cell separator thatremoves the plasma, containing the IgM, from the red andwhite blood cells and platelets. The blood cells are trans-fused back into the patient, along with a plasma substituteor donated plasma. Plasmapheresis relieves many of theacute symptoms of WM. Individuals with WM may begiven fluid to counter the effects of hyperviscous blood.\nLow blood cell counts\nTreatments for low blood cell levels include:\n• the drug Procrit to treat anemia• transfusions with packed red blood cells to treat anemia\nin later stages of the disease\n• antibiotics to treat infections caused by a deficiency in\nwhite blood cells\n• transfusions with blood platelets\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy , the use of anti-cancer drugs, helps\nto slow the abnormal development of plasma cells, butdoes not cure WM. It can reduce the amount of IgM in the\nbone marrow. In particular, chemotherapy is used to treatsevere hyperviscosity and anemia that are caused by WM.\nChlorambucil (Leukeran), possibly in combination\nwith prednisone, is the typical chemotherapy choice forWM. This treatment is effective in 57% of cases. Thesedrugs are taken by mouth. Prednisone is a corticosteroidthat affects many body systems. It has anti-cancer andanti-inflammatory effects and is an immune system sup-pressant. Other drug combinations that are used to treatWM include cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), vincristine,and prednisone, with or without doxorubicin. Fludarib-ine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and corticosteroids also\nmay be used.\nside effects of chemotherapy may include:\n• mouth sores\n• nausea and indigestion\n• hair loss\n• increased appetite\n• nervousness\n• insomnia\nThese side effects disappear after the chemotherapy\nis discontinued.\nThe long-term management of WM usually is\naccomplished through a combination of plasmapheresisand chemotherapy.\nAlternative treatment\nBiological therapy or immunotherapy, with the\npotent, immune system protein interferon alpha, is usedto relieve the symptoms of WM. Interferon alpha worksby boosting the body’s immune response. Interferon cancause flu-like symptoms, such as fever , chills, and\nfatigue. It also can cause digestive problems and mayaffect blood pressure.\nThe drug rituximab, an antibody that is active against\nantibody-producing cells, is effective in about 30% ofindividuals with WM. Rituximab is a monoclonal anti-body produced in the laboratory. Monoclonal antibodytreatment may cause a an allergic reaction in some people.\nPrognosis\nThere is no cure for WM. In general, patients go into\npartial or complete remission following initial treat-ments. However the disease is not cured and follow-uptreatment may be necessary.\nThe prognosis for this cancer depends on an individ-\nual’s age, general health, and genetic (hereditary) make-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3546Waldenström’s macroglobulinemiaup.

    "title": "Warts",
    "content": "Warts\nDefinition\nWarts are small, benign growths caused by a viral\ninfection of the skin or mucous membrane. The virusinfects the surface layer. The viruses that cause warts aremembers of the human papilloma virus (HPV) family.Warts are not cancerous but some strains of HPV , usuallynot associated with warts, have been linked with cancer\nformation. Warts are contagious from person to person andfrom one area of the body to another on the same person.\nDescription\nParticularly common among children, young adults,\nand women, warts are a problem for 7-10% of the popu-lation. There are close to 60 types of HPV that causewarts, each preferring a specific skin location. Forinstance, some types of HPV cause warts to grow on theskin, others cause them to grow inside the mouth, whilestill others cause them to grow on the genital and rectalareas. However, most can be active anywhere on thebody. The virus enters through the skin and producesnew warts after an incubation period of one to eightmonths. Warts are usually skin-colored and feel rough tothe touch, but they also can be dark, flat, and smooth.\nWarts are passed from person to person, directly and\nindirectly. Some people are continually susceptible towarts, while others are more resistant to HPV and sel-dom get them. The virus takes hold more readily when\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3547Wartsthe skin has been damaged in some way, which may\nexplain why children who bite their nails tend to havewarts located on their fingers. People who take a medica-tion to suppress their immune system or are on long-termsteroid use are also prone to a wart virus infection. Thissame is true for patients with AIDS .\nCauses and symptoms\nThe more common types of warts include:\n• common hand warts \n• foot warts • flat warts •genital warts\nHand warts\nCommon hand warts grow around the nails, on the\nfingers, and on the backs of hands. They appear more fre-quently where skin is broken, such as in areas where fin-gernails are bitten or hangnails picked.\nFoot warts\nFoot warts are called plantar warts because the word\nplantar is the medical term for the sole of the foot, thearea where the wart usually appears as a single lesion oras a cluster. Plantar warts, however, do not stick up abovethe surface like common warts. The ball of the foot, theheel and the plantar part of the toes are the most likelylocations for the warts because the skin in those areas issubject to the most weight, pressure and irritation, mak-ing a small break or crack more likely.Plantar warts are familiar to all ages groups, appear-\ning frequently in children between the ages of 12-16. Ado-lescents often come into contact with a wart virus in alocker room, swimming pool area, or by walking barefoot-ed on dirty surfaces. The blood vessels feeding them arethe black dots that are visible on the wart. If left untreated,these warts can grow to an inch or more in circumferenceand spread into clusters of several warts. They are knownto be very painful at times, the pain usually compared to\nthe feeling of a permanent stone in the shoe particularly ifthe wart is on a pressure point of the foot. People with dia-\nbetes mellitus are prone to complications from plantar\nwarts related to the development of sores or ulceration andthe poor healing potential associated with diabetes. \nFlat warts\nFlat warts tend to grow in great numbers and are\nsmaller and smoother than other warts. They can eruptanywhere, appearing more frequently on the legs ofwomen, the faces of children, and on the areas of the facethat are shaved by young adult males.\nGenital warts\nGenital warts, also called condyloma acuminata or\nvenereal warts, are one of the most common causes ofsexually transmitted disease (STD) in this country.According to the Journal of the American Medical Asso-\nciation’s STD Information Center, they are contracted by\nsexual contact with an infected person who carries HPVand are more contagious than other warts. It is estimatedthat two-thirds of the people who have sexual contactwith a partner with genital warts will develop the diseasewithin three months of contact. As a result, about onemillion new cases of genital warts are diagnosed in theUnited States each year.\nGenital warts tend to be small flat bumps or they\nmay be thin and tall. They are usually soft and not scalylike other warts. In women, genital warts appear on thegenitalia, within the vagina, on the cervix, and around theanus or within the rectum. In men, genital warts usuallyappear on the tip of the penis but may also be found onthe scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts can alsodevelop in the mouth of a person who has had oral sexualcontact with an infected person.\nDiagnosis\nPatients who notice warts in their genital area should\nsee a doctor. The doctor may be able to diagnose thewarts with a simple examination. If the warts are small,the doctor may put a vinegar-like liquid on the skin,which makes the warts turn white and easier to see, andthen use a magnifying glass to look for them.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3548Warts\nCluster of warts on finger. (Custom Medical Stock Photo.\nReproduced by permission.)Treatment\nHome/self treatment\nMany of the nonprescription wart remedies available\nat drug stores will remove simple warts from hands andfingers. These medications may be lotions, ointments, orplasters and work by chemically removing the skin thatwas affected by the wart virus. The chemicals are strong,however, and should be used with care since they canremove healthy as well as infected skin. These solutionsshould be avoided by diabetics and those with cardiovas-cular or other circulatory disorders whose skin may beinsensitive and not appreciate irritation.\nFlat warts are best treated with topical retinoides\n(retinoic acid) or a gel containing salicylic acid. The aciddoesn’t actually kill the wart virus, but waterlogs the skinso that the surface layer, with the virus, peels off. Theseproducts can take up to three months of treatmentdepending on the size and depth of the wart. Patches arealso good to use. Rather than applying drops, a small padis placed on the wart and left for 48 hours and thenreplaced with a new one. The patch usually contains ahigher concentration of salicylic acid and may irritate thesurrounding skin. If this occurs, patients should switch toa gel or stop medication for a period. To help the healingprocess for flat facial warts, men should shave with anelectric shaver or temporarily grow a beard. Women withflat warts on areas that are shaved should use other meth-ods to remove hair such as depilatory cream or wax.\nProfessional treatment\nPhysicians should be consulted if there are no signs\nof progress after a month of self treatment. Doctors havemany ways of removing warts, including using strongertopically applied chemicals than those available in drug-stores. Some of these solutions include podofilox, topi-cal podophyllum, and trichloracetic acid (TCA). Someburning and discomfort for one or more days followingtreatment can be expected. Although these chemicals areeffective, they may not destroy all warts completely. Asecond method of removal is freezing or cryosurgery onthe wart using liquid nitrogen. Cryotherapy is relative-\nly inexpensive, does not require anesthesia, and usuallydoes not result in scarring. Although temporarilyuncomfortable, it provides an effective and safe way todeliver freezing temperatures to a particular area on theskin, and healing is usually quick. Physicians may alsochoose to burn the wart with liquid nitrogen or numb theskin and then scrape off the wart. Another removalprocess is electrocautery (electric burning), destroyingthe wart by burning it with an electric needle. Laser\nsurgery is also becoming a more common option for\nremoving warts.Genital warts are the most difficult to treat. They can\nbe removed, but the viral infection itself cannot be cured.Often, because the warts are so small, more than onetreatment may be needed. The virus continues to live inthe deeper skin, which is why warts often return afterthey have been removed. Strong chemicals may beapplied as well as surgical excision with or without elec-trocautery. This therapy requires a small operative proce-dure and a local anesthetic. Laser therapy, although moreexpensive, is often used for treating venereal warts thatare more extensive. The use of lasers which vaporize thelesion can theoretically transmit the HPV . It is not at allclear, however, if this occurs.\nThere is no one recommended method for eliminat-\ning plantar warts. If detected early, cryotherapy is usuallyenough. However, they can be very resilient, requiringtreatment over several months. Treatment ranges fromthe conservative approach of applying chemical solutionsto the more aggressive option of surgery. Patients withdiabetes or vascular disease are usually treated with themore conservative methods.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are a variety of alternative approaches to\nthe treatment of warts. The suggestions describedbelow apply to common warts and plantar warts, notto genital or cervical warts. Since genital and cervialwarts are transmitted sexually, they should be treatedby a physician\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3549Warts\nSeborrhoeic warts appearing on this patient’s back. (Cus-\ntom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)For the treatment of common or plantar warts, alter-\nnative practitioners may recommend these remedies.\n• Apply a paste made of vitamin C powder to the wart for\none to two weeks. \n• Place a crushed or sliced garlic clove over the wart for\nseven consecutive nights while sleeping.\n• Soak the wart in water, put cross-hatches over it with a\nsterile needle, and apply drops of thuja ( Thuja occiden-\ntalis) tincture onto the wart. Repeat the cross-hatching\nand tincture application until the wart is saturated withthe tincture. Repeat several times each day for one totwo weeks. (A tincture is an herbal extract made withalcohol.)\n• Tape a piece of banana peel, latex side down, over the\nwart and leave it on overnight. Repeat nightly for one totwo weeks.\nBecause warts are caused by a virus, general immune\nsystem support can be effective in helping to keep wartsfrom coming back after treatment or to keep them frommultiplying or growing. Eating a well balanced diet highin sources of vitamins A, C, and E can help strengthen\nthe immune system. Avoiding stress , which is believed to\ncompromise the immune system, is also helpful.\nPrognosis\nEven though genital warts may be removed, the virus\nitself continues to live. The HPV can cause tissue changesin the cervix of women with cervical infection. The gen-KEY TERMS\nCondyloma acuminata —Another term for genital\nwarts.\nCryotherapy —Freezing with liquid nitrogen for\nremoval.\nEndometritis —Inflammation of the endometrium\nor mucous membrane of the uterus.\nEpidermis —The outer layer of human skin.\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) —A family of virus-\nes that causes hand warts, foot warts, flat wartsand genital warts.\nRetinoic acid —Vitamin A\n1acid which is used topi-\ncally to treat acne.\nSalicylic acid —An agent prescribed in the treat-\nment of hyperkeratotic skin conditions and fungalinfections.eral recommendation for women who have a history of\ngenital warts is to see their doctors every six months forPap smears to monitor any changes that may occur.\nFor plantar warts, the treatment goal is to destroy the\nwart and its virus without causing much damage tohealthy skin. It is not unusual for treatment to cause painuntil the foot heals because of the weight put on the foot. \nPrevention\nGenital warts can be prevented by using condoms\nand avoiding unprotected sex. Barrier protection will not,however, prevent the spread of wart-causing HPV touncovered areas such as the pubis and upper thighs. Plan-tar warts can be prevented by wearing shoes, changingshoes daily, keeping feet clean and dry, and not ignoringskin growths and changes in the skin.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Editors of Time-Life Books.

    "content": "Wechsler intelligence test\nDefinition\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scales are a series of\nstandardized tests used to evaluate cognitive abilities andintellectual abilities in children and adults.\nPurpose\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (regu-\nlar, revised, and third edition) and Wechsler Preschooland Primary Scale of Intelligence are used as tools inschool placement, in determining the presence of a learn-ing disability or a developmental delay, in identifyinggiftedness, and in tracking intellectual development.\nThe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales (regular and\nrevised) are used to determine vocational ability, toassess adult intellectual ability in the classroom, and todetermine organic deficits. Both adult and children’sWechsler scales are often included in neuropsychologicaltesting to assess the brain function of individuals withneurological impairments.\nPrecautions\nIntelligence testing requires a clinically trained\nexaminer. The Wechsler scales should be administered,scored, and interpreted by a trained professional, prefer-ably a psychologist or psychiatrist.\nDescription\nAll of the Wechsler scales are divided into six verbal\nand five performance subtests. The complete test takes60-90 minutes to administer. Verbal and Performance IQsare scored based on the results of the testing, and then acomposite Full Scale IQ score is computed. Although ear-lier editions of some of the Wechsler Scales are still avail-able, the latest revisions are described below:\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised\n(WAIS-R)\nThe WAIS-R, the 1981 revision of the original\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, is designed for adults,age 16-74. The 11 subtests of the WAIS-R include infor-mation, digit span, vocabulary, arithmetic, comprehen-sion, similarities, picture completion, picture arrange-ment, block design, object assembly, and digit symbol.An example of questions on the subtest of similaritiesmight be: “Describe how the following pair of words arealike or the same—hamburger and pizza.” A correctresponse would be “Both are things to eat.”\nWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third\nEdition (WISC-III) \nThe WISC-III subtests includes many of the same\ncategories of subtests as the WAIS-R. In addition, thereare two optional performance subtests: symbol searchand mazes.\nWechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of\nIntelligence (WPPSI)\nThe WPPSI is designed for children age 4-\n6&frac12; years. The test is divided into six verbal andfive performance subtests. The eleven subtests are pre-sented in the following order: information, animal houseand animal house retest, vocabulary, picture completion,arithmetic, mazes, geometric design, similarities, blockdesign, comprehension, and sentences.\nThe 1997 Medicare reimbursement rate for psycho-\nlogical and neuropsychological testing, including intelli-gence testing, is $58.35 an hour. Billing time typicallyincludes test administration, scoring and interpretation,and reporting. Many insurance plans cover all or a por-tion of diagnostic psychological testing. \nNormal results\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scales are standardized\ntests, meaning that as part of the test design, they wereadministered to a large representative sample of the tar-get population, and norms were determined from theresults. The scales have a mean, or average, standardscore of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The standarddeviation indicates how far above or below the norm thesubject’s score is. For example, a ten-year-old is assessedwith the WISC-III scale and achieves a full-scale IQscore of 85. The mean score of 100 is the average level atwhich all 10-year-olds in the representative sample per-formed. This child’s score would be one standard devia-tion below that norm.\nWhile the full-scale IQ scores provide a reference\npoint for evaluation, they are only an average of a varietyof skill areas. A trained psychologist will evaluate andinterpret an individual’s performance on the scale’s sub-tests to discover their strengths and weaknesses and offerrecommendations based upon these findings.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3551Wechsler intelligence testResources\nBOOKS\nMaddox, Taddy.

One of themain features of the disease is an inflammation of theblood vessels ( vasculitis ). The inflammation narrows the\nblood vessels and reduces the blood flow to the affectedorgans. This destroys tissues and damages vital organs.\nDescription\nWegener’s granulomatosis (WG) is not a contagious\ndisease, and there is no evidence to suggest that it ishereditary either. It is a very rare disease, affecting only 1in every 30,000-50,000 people. About 500 new cases arediagnosed each year. The disease can occur at any age,however, it mostly affects individuals in their 30s and40s. It affects males and females equally. Ninety sevenpercent of all patients are Caucasian, 2% are Black and1% are of another race.\nCauses and symptoms\nNo viral, bacterial, or other causative agent has yet\nbeen identified for WG. It is thought to be an autoim-mune disease, meaning that the body’s immune systemattacks “itself,” that is, the body’s own tissues.\nWhenever there is an infection in the body, pro-\nteins called antibodies, which are capable of attackingthe infectious agent, are formed in the blood. In WG,the antibodies that are formed are directed against thewhite blood cells of the immune system. They aretherefore called “auto-antibodies” (antibodies againstone’s own body cells). These auto-antibodies bind tothe blood cells and forms clumps known as immunecomplexes. The complexes accumulate in the tissuesand the blood vessels, leading to a tumor-like (granu-lomatous) inflammation of the blood vessels. Thisslows down the blood flow to the different organs andtissues, causing damage and resulting in the manysymptoms of WG.\nThe symptoms of WG, and the severity of the symp-\ntoms, vary from patient to patient. One of the most com-mon features is a chronic runny nose and other cold-likesymptoms that do not respond to standard treatment. Thecold symptoms gradually worsen and could lead tosinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), middle ear infec-\ntion ( otitis media ),cough , coughing of blood, and\ninflammation of the lung (pleuritis and pneumonia ).\nOther symptoms include fever ,fatigue , loss of appetite,\nweight loss, joint pain , night sweats, change in urine\ncolor, and weakness.\nKidney (renal) disease is the most serious develop-\nment of WG. Patients who do not have renal disease aresaid to have “Limited Wegener’s.”\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3552Wegener’s granulomatosisDiagnosis\nEarly diagnosis is critical for the most effective treat-\nment of the disease. However, there are no specific labo-ratory tests for WG. Blood tests are used to rule out othercauses of the symptoms and to determine which organsare affected. The blood tests often show anemia (low redcell count) and high white blood cell counts. If the kid-neys are involved, red blood cells are seen in the urinewhen viewed under a microscope. Also, blood tests aimedat measuring kidney function may show abnormalities.\nChest x rays are used to determine if the lungs are\ninvolved. Computed tomography scans (CT scans) of\nsinuses and lungs, and kidney biopsy , are also important\ntools used in diagnosing WG.\nA specific type of antibody called anti-neutrophil\ncytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) is seen in the blood ofabout 90% of the patients with WG. The ANCA are agroup of antibodies directed against the individual’s ownwhite blood cells (namely, the neutrophils). These anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are also found in otherinflammatory conditions and diseases (such as HIVinfection). Though the ANCA test is useful, it cannot beused by itself to make a diagnosis of WG. However, theamount of ANCA in the blood can be measured and cor-relates well with the progression of the disease. Whenthere is a relapse or a flare-up, the ANCA levels go up.Levels decrease when the disease is controlled by appro-priate treatment.\nSince there are no definitive laboratory tests for WG,\nand the initial symptoms of the disease are not very spe-cific, it takes five to 15 months, on an average, to make adiagnosis of WG.\nTreatment\nCyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) which is an anti-can-\ncer drug, and corticosteroids , such as prednisone, are\nused to treat WG. These are powerful drugs that suppressthe immune system. However, they are also very toxicand can have serious side effects. The patient has to bewatched carefully by the doctors and the dosage of thedrugs has to be adjusted, if needed.\nSince the patient’s immune system is suppressed\nwhile on these drugs, he or she is at an increased risk forcontracting infections. Vaccinations for flu and pneumo-nia are recommended.\nPrognosis\nIn the past, approximately 80% of the patients with\nuntreated WG died within a year of contracting the dis-ease and 90% died within two years. Today, however, theKEY TERMS\nAuto-antibodies —An antibody that is produced\nin, and reacts with, an antigen in the same personor animal.\nAutoimmune disease —Any disease which causes\ntissue injury due to an immunological reaction ofantibodies against the patient’s own tissues.\nGranulomatous —Resembling a tumor made of\ngranular material.\nImmune complexes —Clusters or aggregates of\nantigen and antibody bound together.\nVasculitis —Inflammation of the walls of the blood\nvessels.\nprognosis has been dramatically improved. With appro-\npriate treatment, patients can survive for much longerperiods and lead relatively normal lives.\nApproximately 50% of the patients with WG will\nhave a relapse of the disease. This generally happenswithin two years of stopping the medication, but canoccur at any point either during treatment or after stop-ping treatment. Therefore, it is extremely important thatpatients continue to see their doctors regularly even afterstopping the medications.\nPrevention\nAt present, there are no preventive measures known\nfor Wegener’s granulomatosis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

    "content": "Wheezing\nDefinition\nWheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound associ-\nated with labored breathing. \nDescription\nWheezing occurs when a child or adult tries to\nbreathe deeply through air passages that are narrowed orfilled with mucus as a result of:\n• allergy\n• infection\n• illness\n• irritation\nWheezing is most common when exhaling. It is\nsometimes accompanied by a mild sensation of tightnessin the chest. Anxiety about not being able to breathe eas-\nily can cause muscle tension that makes matters worse.\nCauses and symptoms\nWheezing is the symptom most associated with\nasthma . It can be caused by:\n• exposure to allergens (food, pollen, and other sub-\nstances, that cause a person to have an allergic reaction)\n• fumes\n• ice-cold drinks, or very cold air• medication• strenuous exercise\n• weather changes.\n• foreign objects trapped in the airway• cystic fibrosis, and other genetic disorders• respiratory illnesses like pneumonia ,bronchitis , con-\ngestive heart failure , and emphysemaDiagnosis\nA family physician, allergist, or pulmonary special-\nist takes a medical history that includes questions aboutallergies , or unexplained symptoms that may be the\nresult of allergic reactions. If the pattern of the patient’ssymptoms suggests the presence of allergy, skin andblood tests are performed to identify the precise nature ofthe problem.\nA pulmonary function test may be ordered to mea-\nsure the amount of air moving through the patient’sbreathing passages. X rays are sometimes indicated forpatients whose wheezing seems to be caused by chronicbronchitis or emphysema. \nTreatment\nMild wheezing may be relieved by drinking plenty\nof juice, water, weak tea, and broth.

    "title": "Whiplash",
    "content": "Whiplash\nDefinition\nWhiplash is a sudden, moderate-to-severe strain\naffecting the bones, discs, muscles, nerves, or tendons ofthe neck.\nDescription\nThe neck is composed of seven small bones. Known\nas the cervical spine, these bones:\n• support the head • help maintain an unobstructed enclosure for the spinal\ncord • influence the shape and structure of the spine \n• affect posture and balance\nAbout 1,000,000 whiplash injuries occur in the Unit-\ned States every year. Most are the result of motor vehicleaccidents or collisions involving contact sports. Whenunexpected force jerks the head back, then forward thebones of the neck snap out of position and irritated nervescan interfere with flow of blood and transmission of nerveimpulses. Pinched nerves can damage or destroy the func-tion of body parts whose actions they govern.\nRisk factors\nOsteoarthritis of the spine increases the risk of\nwhiplash injury. So do poor driving habits, driving in badweather, or driving when tired, tense, or under the influ-ence of alcohol or other drugs.\nCauses and symptoms\nTension shortens and tightens muscles. Fatigue\nrelaxes them. Either condition increases the likelihoodthat whiplash will occur and the probability that theinjury will be severe.\nSometimes symptoms of whiplash appear right away.\nSometimes they do not develop until hours, days, or weeksafter the injury occurs. Symptoms of whiplash include:\n•pain or stiffness in the neck, jaw, shoulders, or arms \n• dizziness \n• headache • loss of feeling in an arm or hand • nausea and vomiting\nDepression and vision problems are rare symptoms\nof this condition.\nDiagnosis\nWhiplash is difficult to diagnose because x rays and\nother imaging studies do not always reveal changes inbone structure. Organs affected by nerve damage orreduced blood supply may generate symptoms not clear-ly related to whiplash.\nDiagnosis is based on observation of the patient’s\nsymptoms, medical history, physical examination , and\nneurological studies to determine whether the spine hasbeen injured.\nTreatment\nMedication, physical therapy, and supportive mea-\nsures are used to treat whiplash. Chiropractors gentlyrealign the spine to relax pinched nerves or improveblood flow. A patient whose symptoms are severe may\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3555Whiplashwear a soft, padded collar (Thomas collar or cervical col-\nlar) until the pain diminishes.\nWhen pressure on the root of the nerve causes loss\nof strength or sensation in a hand or arm, a cervical trac-\ntion apparatus may be recommended.\nSelf-care\nInflammation and cramping can be alleviated by\nwrapping ice or an ice pack in a thin towel and applying itto the injured area for 10-20 minutes every hour. After thefirst 24 hours, painful muscle spasms can be prevented byalternating cold packs with heat treatments . Letting a\nwarm shower run on the neck and shoulders for 10-20minutes twice a day is recommended. Between showers,warm towels or a heat lamp should be used to warm andsoothe the neck for 10-15 minutes several times a day.\nImproving posture is important, and gentle massage\ncan be beneficial. Sleeping without a pillow promotes heal-ing, and a cervical collar or small rolled towel pinned underthe chin can provide support and prevent muscle fatigue.\nAlcohol should be avoided. A chiropractor, primary\ncare physician, or orthopedic specialist should be noti-fied whenever a painful neck injury occurs. Another situ-ation requiring attention is if the face or arm weaken orbecome painful or numb following a neck injury.\nPrognosis\nWith treatment, whiplash can usually be cured in\none week to three months after injury occurs. If nerveroots are damaged, numbness and weakness may lastuntil recovery is complete.\nPrevention\nChiropractors can recommend diet and exercise\ntechniques to reduce stress and tension. Careful, defen-\nsive driving, wearing seatbelts, and using padded auto-mobile headrests can lessen the likelihood of whiplash.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nSturzenegger, M., et al. “Presenting Symptoms and Signs after\nWhiplash Injury: The Influence of Accident Mecha-nisms.” Neurology 44 (1994): 688.\nOTHER\n“Whiplash.” ThriveOnline. 6 June 1995 <http://thriveonline.\noxygen.com>.\n“Whiplash.” Loyola University Health System. 6 June 1998\n<http://www.luhs.org>.\nHaggerty, Maureen. “Whiplash.” A Healthy Me Page. 7 June\n1998 <http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/topic100587681>.\nMaureen HaggertyWhipple’s disease seeMalabsorption\nsyndrome\nWhite blood cell count \nand differential\nDefinition\nThe white blood cell count and differential deter-\nmine the number of white blood cells and the percentageof each type of white blood cell in a person’s blood.These tests are included in general health examinationsand help investigate a variety of illnesses, includinginfection, allergy, and leukemia.\nPurpose\nThe white blood cell count provides a clue to the\npresence of illness. White cells protect the body by fight-ing infection and attacking foreign material. When extrawhite cells are needed, the bone marrow increases pro-duction.\nThere are five types of white cells, each with differ-\nent functions: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,eosinophils, and basophils. The differential reveals ifthese cells are present in a normal distribution, or if onecell type is increased or decreased. This informationhelps diagnose specific types of illness.\nConditions or medications that weaken the immune\nsystem, such as AIDS or chemotherapy , cause a\ndecrease in white cells.

A sample of blood is mixed with a chemicalto burst the red blood cells. The remaining white cells arecounted by the instrument.\nThe differential is done by spreading a drop of blood\non a microscope slide. The slide is stained with a specialstain and examined under a microscope. One-hundredwhite cells are counted and identified as either neutrophils,bands, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils or basophils.Any atypical or immature cells also are counted. Cells areidentified by the shape and appearance of the nucleus, thecolor of cytoplasm (the background of the cell), and thepresence and color of granules. The percentage of eachcell type is reported. At the same time, red cells andplatelets are examined for abnormalities in appearance.Some instruments perform an automated differential.\nBoth the white blood cell count (also called white\ncount or leukocyte count) and the differential (also calleddiff) are covered by insurance. Results are available thesame day.\nPreparation\nThis test requires 7 mL of blood. A healthcare work-\ner ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper arm, locates avein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a needle intothat vein.

    "title": "Whooping cough",
    "content": "Whooping cough\nDefinition\nWhooping cough , also known as pertussis, is a high-\nly contagious disease which causes classic spasms\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3557Whooping cough(paroxysms) of uncontrollable coughing, followed by a\nsharp, high-pitched intake of air which creates the char-acteristic “whoop” of the disease’s name.\nDescription\nWhooping cough is caused by a bacteria called Bor-\ndatella pertussis . B. pertussis causes its most severe\nsymptoms by attaching itself to those cells in the respira-tory tract which have cilia. Cilia are small, hair-like pro-jections that beat continuously, and serve to constantlysweep the respiratory tract clean of such debris as mucus,bacteria, viruses, and dead cells. When B. pertussis inter-\nferes with this normal, janitorial function, mucus and cel-lular debris accumulate and cause constant irritation tothe respiratory tract, triggering coughing and increasingfurther mucus production. \nWhooping cough is a disease which exists through-\nout the world. While people of any age can contractwhooping cough, children under the age of two are at thehighest risk for both the disease and for serious compli-cations and death . Apparently, exposure to B. pertussis\nbacteria earlier in life gives a person some immunityagainst infection with it later on. Subsequent infectionsresemble the common cold .Causes and symptoms\nWhooping cough has four somewhat overlapping\nstages: incubation, catarrhal stage, paroxysmal stage, andconvalescent stage.\nAn individual usually acquires B. pertussis by inhal-\ning droplets infected with the bacteria coughed into theair by someone already suffering with the infection.Incubation is the symptomless period of seven to 14 daysafter breathing in the B. pertussis bacteria, and during\nwhich the bacteria multiply and penetrate the lining tis-sues of the entire respiratory tract.\nThe catarrhal stage is often mistaken for an exceed-\ningly heavy cold. The patient has teary eyes, sneezing,fatigue , poor appetite, and an extremely runny nose (rhi-\nnorrhea). This stage lasts about 10-14 days.\nThe paroxysmal stage, lasting two to four weeks,\nbegins with the development of the characteristic whoop-ing cough. Spasms of uncontrollable coughing, the“whooping” sound of the sharp inspiration of air, and vom-iting are all hallmarks of this stage. The whoop is believedto occur due to inflammation and mucous which narrowthe breathing tubes, causing the patient to struggle to get airinto his/her lungs; the effort results in intense exhaustion.The paroxysms (spasms) can be induced by over activity,feeding, crying, or even overhearing someone else cough.\nThe mucus which is produced during the paroxysmal\nstage is thicker and more difficult to clear than the morewatery mucus of the catarrhal stage, and the patientbecomes increasingly exhausted attempting to clear therespiratory tract through coughing. Severely ill childrenmay have great difficult maintaining the normal level ofoxygen in their systems, and may appear somewhat blueafter a paroxysm of coughing, due to the low oxygen con-tent of their blood. Such children may also suffer fromswelling and degeneration of the brain (encephalopathy),which is believed to be caused both by lack of oxygen tothe brain during paroxysms, and also by bleeding into thebrain caused by increased pressure during coughing.Seizures may result from decreased oxygen to the brain.Some children have such greatly increased abdominalpressure during coughing that hernias result (hernias arethe abnormal protrusion of a loop of intestine through aweak area of muscle). Another complicating factor duringthis phase is the development of pneumonia from infec-\ntion with another bacterial agent; the bacteria takes holddue to the patient’s already-weakened condition.\nIf the patient survives the paroxysmal stage, recov-\nery occurs gradually during the convalescent stage, usu-ally taking about three to four weeks. However, spasmsof coughing may continue to occur over a period ofmonths, especially when a patient contracts a cold, orother respiratory infection.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3558Whooping cough\nA magnified image of a pertussis toxin crystal that causes\nwhooping cough. (National Institutes of Health/Custom Med-\nical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)Diagnosis\nDiagnosis based just on the patient’s symptoms is not\nparticularly accurate, as the catarrhal stage may appear tobe a heavy cold, a case of the flu, or a simple bronchitis .\nOther viruses and tuberculosis infections can cause\nsymptoms similar to those found during the paroxysmalstage. The presence of a pertussis-like cough along withan increase of certain specific white blood cells (lympho-cytes) is suggestive of pertussis (whooping cough). How-ever, cough can occur from other pertussis-like viruses.The most accurate method of diagnosis is to culture (growon a laboratory plate) the organisms obtained from swab-bing mucus out of the nasopharynx (the breathing tubecontinuous with the nose). B. pertussis can then be identi-\nfied by examining the culture under a microscope.\nTreatment\nTreatment with the antibiotic erythromycin is help-\nful only at very early stages of whooping cough, duringincubation and early in the catarrhal stage. After the ciliaand the cells bearing those cilia, are damaged, theprocess cannot be reversed. Such a patient will experi-ence the full progression of whooping cough symptoms;symptoms will only improve when the old, damaged lin-ing cells of the respiratory tract are replaced over timewith new, healthy, cilia-bearing cells. However, treat-ment with erythromycin is still recommended, todecrease the likelihood of B. pertussis spreading. In fact,\nall members of the household where a patient withwhooping cough lives should be treated with ery-thromycin to prevent the spread of B. pertussis through-\nout the community. The only other treatment is support-ive, and involves careful monitoring of fluids to preventdehydration , rest in a quiet, dark room to decrease\nparoxysms, and suctioning of mucus.\nPrognosis\nJust under 1% of all cases of whooping cough cause\ndeath. Children who die of whooping cough usually haveone or more of the following three conditions present:\n• severe pneumonia, perhaps with accompanying en-\ncephalopathy\n• extreme weight loss, weakness, and metabolic abnor-\nmalities due to persistent vomiting during paroxysms ofcoughing\n• other pre-existing conditions, so that the patient is\nalready in a relatively weak, vulnerable state (such con-ditions may include low birth weight babies, poornutrition , infection with the measles virus, presence of\nother respiratory or gastrointestinal infections or dis-eases)KEY TERMS\nCilia—Tiny, hair-like projections from a cell. In the\nrespiratory tract, cilia beat constantly in order tomove mucus and debris up and out of the respira-tory tree, in order to protect the lung from infec-tion or irritation by foreign bodies.\nEncephalopathy —Swelling and degeneration of\nthe brain.\nPrevention\nThe mainstay of prevention lies in programs similar\nto the mass immunization program in the United Stateswhich begins immunization inoculations when infantsare two months old. The pertussis vaccine, most oftengiven as one immunization together with diphtheria and\ntetanus , has greatly reduced the incidence of whooping\ncough. Unfortunately, there has been some concern aboutserious neurologic side effects from the vaccine itself.This concern led huge numbers of parents in England,Japan, and Sweden to avoid immunizing their children,which in turn has led to major epidemics of disease inthose countries. However, several carefully constructedresearch studies have disproved the idea that the pertussisvaccine is the cause of neurologic damage. Furthermore,a newer formulation of the pertussis vaccine is available.Unlike the old whole cell pertussis vaccine, which iscomposed of the entire bacterial cell which has beendeactivated (and therefore unable to cause infection), thenewer acellular pertussis vaccine does not use a wholecell of the bacteria, but is made up of (between two andfive) chemical components of the B. pertussis bacteria.\nThe acellular pertussis vaccine appears to greatly reducethe risk of unpleasant reactions to the vaccine, includinghigh fever and discomfort following vaccination . \nResources\nBOOKS\n“Pertussis.” In Sherris Medical Microbiology: An Introduction\nto Infectious Diseases. 3rd ed.

Wilder-ness medicine has evolved to deal with situations inwhich definitive medical care is hours or days away, andin which patients may require quick or extended atten-tion. Wilderness medicine utilizes first aid techniques,but requires additional skills that take into accountdemanding environments, uncommon threats to health,hazardous or lengthy travel to medical facilities, and dif-ficulties in obtaining food, water, and shelter.\nWilderness medicine uses techniques to assess and\ntreat a variety of conditions and injuries, including:\n•wounds and burns\n• external and internal bleeding• cardiac arrest• head injuries• spinal cord injuries•fractures and dislocations\n•altitude sickness\n• problems from cold and heat• allergic and anaphylactic reactions• lightning strikes• near drowning• insect, reptile and animal bites• poisoning• emergency child birth\nPrecautions\nIn wilderness situations caregivers should follow the\nmaxim of first, do no harm. Uninjured members of\ngroups should not attempt rescues that place themselvesin danger. People administering first aid or wildernessmedicine should remain calm and organized at all times.Only those with experience should administer medica-tions and medical procedures. Injured people should notbe moved until they are fully evaluated, or unless envi-ronmental conditions are threatening and require imme-diate shelter.\nPeople with certain medical conditions should avoid\ntravel in the wilderness, which can make existing condi-tions worse. These conditions include metastatic cancer ,\npeptic ulcers, coronary artery disease , chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease, clotting or bleeding disorders, high-altitude sickness, chronic rheumatoid arthritis , chronic\nsevere back pain, and chronic knee and hip joint disease.\nDescription\nThe first stage of wilderness medicine begins with an\nassessment of the injury or condition. Primary assessmentis used to quickly determine if a patient is in a life-threat-ening situation and to provide immediate emergency care.Secondary assessment is the thorough evaluation of apatient after life-threatening circumstances are relieved.\nPrimary assessment\nA rule of thumb for the first steps of primary assess-\nment, recommended by the Wilderness Medicine Insti-tute, is the ABCDE procedure. It stands for Airway,Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure assess-ment. First, a patient’s airway should be checked by closeobservation of whether or not air can move in and out andany obstructions to breathing should be alleviated. Inunconscious people the tongue can often fall to the backof the throat and block breathing and the head should betilted back and the lower jaw raised to alleviate theobstruction. If neck or spinal cord injuries are suspected,the head must be handled with extreme care to avoid fur-ther injury to the delicate spinal cord. In these cases, thelower jaw can be pulled forward to open the airway. If theneck is severely out of alignment due to an injury or fall,it may be gently realigned to free the airway.\nAfter the airway is cleared and breathing is ensured, a\npatient’s circulation is checked by noting the pulse of thecarotid artery, on the neck, the pulse of the femoral arteryin the front groin, and by listening to the heartbeat. If pulseis lacking, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR ) may\nbe required, which requires chest compression and mouth-to-mouth breathing. Circulation checks include surveyinga patient for bleeding. If severe bleeding is present, itshould be stopped by direct pressure to the injured area,and by elevating the wound level to the heart if possible.\nDisability assessment means checking for damage to\nthe spinal cord, particularly in the cervical region of theneck. Assessment of exposure determines if environmentalconditions, such as heat or cold, are immediate threats to apatient’s life, which may require actions such as seekingshelter or covering the patient with protective clothing.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3560Wilderness medicineSecondary assessment\nDuring this stage, a thorough physical examination\nof the patient is made from head to toe to determine theextent of injuries or problems. Caretakers performing theassessment should write detailed notes in order to informphysicians or emergency workers later. Patients are thor-oughly interviewed to determine the scope of problemsand any previous medical issues that might be related.Patients should be spoken to calmly to determine theirmental states and how well they respond to stimuli. Vitalsigns such as heart rate and respiration rate should benoted and monitored. The skin should be carefullyobserved for injuries, boils ,rashes , and discoloration.\nRed or flushed skin may indicate fever or heat-related\nconditions, while pale or blotchy skin can point to shock\nor hypothermia . A bluish tint to the skin may mean a\nlack of oxygen. Contact lenses should be removed frompatients in cold conditions, as they can freeze to the eyes.During secondary assessment the patient should beclosely monitored over time until improvement is notedor further treatment decisions are made. At all times inwilderness injuries, shock must be watched for andimmediately treated.\nShock\nIn wilderness situations shock should be suspected\nafter traumatic injuries, significant loss of blood due tointernal or external bleeding, extreme loss of fluids fromvomiting or diarrhea , heart attacks, and spinal cord\ninjuries. Shock is easiest to alleviate when it is treatedearly; when not treated properly, it can progress tounconsciousness and death . When the likelihood of\nshock occurs, patients should be continually monitoredand supported.\nSymptoms of shock begin with anxiety and restless-\nness, with increased heart rates and labored, shallowbreathing. Shock victims tend to sweat profusely with cooland clammy skin. Thirst and nausea are also symptoms.\nShock is treated in the wilderness by maintaining an\nopen airway for the patient to breathe, by treating anyinjuries such as bleeding wounds, by reducing pain ifpossible, and by replenishing fluids. Patients should bekept calm and warm and their feet should be elevated ifpossible to increase blood flow to the organs. If shocksymptoms progress, plans should be quickly made to gethelp or evacuate the patient.\nEvacuation\nEvacuation of a patient may be a crucial decision in\nthe wilderness, depending upon the severity of an injuryor condition, the difficulty of moving the patient, thetime considerations involved, and the availability of out-\nside help. In general if a patient with severe symptoms isnot improving despite care then evacuation becomes nec-essary. The Wilderness Medical Society lists symptomsthat require postponing travel or evacuating patients:\n• progressive deterioration with symptoms of dizziness ,\nfainting , abnormally slow (bradycardia) or fast (tachy-\ncardia) heart rate, labored breathing, poor mental sta-tus, progressive weakness, constant vomiting or diar-rhea, intolerance of oral fluids, or recurrent loss of con-sciousness due to head injuries\n• debilitating pain\n• inability to sustain pace due to medical problems\n• passage of blood by mouth or rectum• symptoms of serious high-altitude illness• infections that get worse despite treatment• chest pain that is not musculoskeletal in origin\n• psychological status threatening the individual or group\nIf a patient cannot be moved without risk of further\ninjury, then other members of a party, preferably two ormore, should be sent to get outside help. When request-ing outside assistance, the safety of incoming rescuersand time constraints should be weighed. Requests foroutside help should be made in writing, and include anassessment of the patient and situation as well as adetailed location of the incident. In some regions, heli-copter evacuation may be an option, and should be usedif an injury is life-threatening.\nDuring evacuation patients must be handled with\nextreme care, as well as insulated from heat, cold andfurther injuries. Larger wilderness expeditions may havespecial devices available for transporting injured mem-bers, while smaller parties may have to improvise trans-porting devices by using backpacks, ropes and otheravailable materials.\nWounds and burns\nIn wilderness situations wound management strives\nto stop bleeding, prevent infection, and speed healing.Bleeding from wounds should be controlled by directpressure. Wounds and burns should be cleaned gentlyand thoroughly, treated with antibiotic ointment, andcovered with bandages to avoid infections. Wounds thathave high risks of infections, such as large cuts, openfractures, and animal bites, should be watched closely.\nExternal and internal bleeding\nExternal bleeding should be stopped by direct pres-\nsure, such as firmly applying a clean bandage or compress\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3561Wilderness medicineto an open wound. Secondary pressure may be applied to\npressure points, such as the large arteries in the upper armor groin, to slow bleeding. Tourniquets are recommendedonly in life-threatening situations, as they can cause com-plications and infections. Symptoms of internal bleedinginclude dizziness, fainting, rapid heartbeat, weak pulse,shortness of breath , thirst, loss of color, vomiting blood,\nblood in the feces or urine, and severe pain or swelling inthe abdomen. If internal bleeding is suspected, medicalhelp should be sought immediately. With all cases of sig-nificant blood loss, shock must be carefully considered.\nCardiac arrest\nCardiac arrest in the wilderness may require CPR,\nalthough CPR is less effective in remote regions that lackaccess to the life support technology that ambulances\nquickly supply. CPR should be administered to patientswho have suffered near drowning, hypothermia, lightningstrikes, and drug overdoses. CPR generally should not beadministered in the wilderness if it endangers the rescuers,if the time of the cardiac arrest is unknown, if the patientappears to be dead or rigor mortis has set in, or if cardiacarrest was caused by severe trauma or lethal injuries.\nHead injuries\nHead injuries that do not cause loss of consciousness\nin the victim are rarely dangerous. Short-term loss of con-sciousness following head injuries is known as concus-\nsion, and these patients should be closely monitored for\n24 hours, including waking them every three hours duringsleep to check for mental alertness. For head injuries thatcause prolonged unconsciousness, the airway and cervi-cal spine must be protected. Severe brain injury is indicat-ed by relapses into unconsciousness, bad headaches,bleeding from the ears, clear fluid draining from the nose,vomiting, persistent disorientation, personality changes,seizures, irregular heartbeat and breathing, and unequal orunreactive pupils. Severe head injuries must be treated byseeking immediate medical help or evacuation.\nSpinal cord injuries\nIf spinal cord injuries are suspected, patients must be\nimmobilized. Some expeditions or rescue teams maycarry special splints or vests in their medical kits. If nosuch equipment is available, spineboards may be fash-\nioned from available materials such as backpacks, poles,or ice axes to prevent unnecessary movement of theinjured backbone.\nFractures and dislocations\nWilderness care for fractures recommends immobi-\nlization by using splints and slings. If manufacturedsplints and slings are not available in the medicine kit,\nthey can be improvised by using natural materials, skipoles, ice axes, clothing, or parts of backpacks. In thecase of dislocations, standard wilderness procedure is tosplint, tape and stabilize the injury in the current position.However, if circulation or nerve function is impaired, or ifthe injured person is in extreme pain, relocation may benecessary by realigning the injured area. Relocation ismost effective if it is done immediately following theinjury, before stiffness or muscle spasms set in.\nAltitude sickness\nSymptoms of altitude sickness include headache ,\nnausea, fatigue , vomiting, and bluish skin. Ataxia, or\nloss of muscular control and balance indicates moresevere altitude sickness. Altitude sickness can occur ataltitudes above 8,000 feet. The best prevention of thecondition is allowing plenty of time for acclimatizationat high altitudes, drinking plenty of fluids, and eating adiet rich in carbohydrates. Aspirin or acetaminophen\nmay be taken, while the drug acetazolamide (Diamox)can relieve symptoms of mild acute mountain sickness(AMS). Other related conditions, which can cause death,are high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), which causes\nfluid accumulation on the brain, and high altitude pul-\nmonary edema (HAPE), which causes fluid in the lungs.\nThe main treatment for acute mountain sickness is torapidly descend to lower altitudes. In some cases oxygenmay be available to ease symptoms.\nProblems from cold and heat\nFrostbite is localized tissue damage from exposure\nto cold, and is remedied by the slow warming of exposedparts, preferably in heated water. Hypothermia is thecondition resulting from lowered body core temperature,and is a common affliction in wilderness medicine. Mildhypothermia occurs when the body’s core temperature(measured rectally) falls from normal to 95°F (35°C)Fahrenheit. Moderate hypothermia gives temperaturesbetween 90-95°F (32.2-35°C), while severe hypothermiaoccurs when a body’s core temperature falls below 90°F(32.2°C). Symptoms include severe shivering, confusion,apathy, drowsiness, slurred speech, and impaired reflex-es, and progresses to the point of unconsciousness.\nEven cases of the mildest hypothermia must be\ncared for closely. Patients in whom hypothermia is sus-pected should be immediately warmed by gently remov-ing wet clothing and providing dry clothing, blankets andshelter. They should be monitored for body temperaturechanges. Severe hypothermia cannot be remedied in thewilderness; victims must be immediately and gentlyevacuated. Warming severe hypothermia victims too\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3562Wilderness medicinequickly is dangerous. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR) may be initiated on victims of severe hypothermiawho have cardiac arrest. In cases of near drowning,hypothermia must always be suspected.\nIllness from heat includes heat exhaustion and the\nmore severe heat stroke . Symptoms include confusion,\nrapid weak pulse, cramps, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea,headache, and high measured temperatures. Sweatingmay or may not occur, and the skin may be clammy andblotched. The principle treatment for heat illness in thewilderness is immediate cooling of the patient, by pro-viding shade, fanning, sponging and immersion in coldwater. Heat exhaustion will correct itself with enoughrest and water. Heat stroke is life threatening and requiresimmediate cooling and rehydration with fluids, prefer-ably intravenous ones. Prevention of heat illness includesproper conditioning, protective clothing, and avoidingdehydration .\nInsect, reptile, and animal bites\nWilderness medicine must deal with an array of\nbites and stings , from bears, snakes, reptiles, spiders,\nscorpions, bees, fish and ticks. Prevention includesknowledge of the threats in the region being explored, aswell as packing appropriate supplies such as bee stingkits for anaphylactic shock and snakebite kits for ven-omous attacks. The goal of treatment is to stop bleeding,prevent infection, and alleviate envenomation, or expo-sure to poison. The Sawyer Extractor is a suction toolused to remove snake venom, while the Epipen and Ana-kit are available by prescription for anaphylactic shockdue to stings and severe allergic reactions.\nPreparation\nKnowledge and sound planning can be the difference\nbetween success and disaster in the backcountry. Mem-bers of extended wilderness outings should undergo thor-ough examinations by their physicians and dentists priorto undertaking expeditions. People going on wildernessoutings should begin in a state of sound physical fitnessby undertaking appropriate conditioning programs, aswell as becoming acclimatized to special conditions suchas altitude or extreme temperatures. Those with medica-tions should be aware of potential side effects and compli-cations, and inform other members of their group. At leasttwo, and preferably all, members of wilderness expedi-tions should be familiar with first aid, wilderness medi-cine and rescue procedures. All members of wildernessoutings should carry appropriate clothing, equipment,food, water, and first aid supplies. Trip itineraries shouldbe recorded with park rangers or other official services.Means of communication with rescue facilities should beconsidered in advance in case emergencies arise.Carrying adequate medical supplies is a crucial\npreparation for wilderness outings. These supplies willvary depending on the length of the trip and the region.Medical kits should contain basic first aid supplies suchas bandages, dressings, pain relievers, water purificationtablets, sunscreen, antiseptics , and ointments. Additional\nmedical supplies include antibiotics , medications for\ngastrointestinal problems, antihistamines and emer-\ngency kits for asthma or allergic reactions, snake and\ninsect bite kits, splints, and basic surgical supplies.Extended expeditions or those facing extreme conditionsmight include intravenous fluids, oxygen bottles for alti-tude problems, rescue gear and evacuation equipment,and specific medications for regional diseases and infec-tions, such as malaria .\nImmunizations are a very important preparation for\nthose entering wilderness areas, particularly in ThirdWorld countries. Immunizations should be planned as farin advance as possible, as some take several weeks tobecome effective and others cannot be given together.Some immunizations that may be required, depending onthe region, include tetanus , poliovirus, measles ,\nmumps ,rubella ,cholera ,yellow fever , meningococ-\ncus, hepatitis, bubonic plague ,typhoid fever and\nrabies . See Resources below for sources of specific\nimmunization information.\nSeveral organizations provide training and certifica-\ntion for various levels of wilderness medicine. The mostbasic levels of preparation are first aid and first respondercertifications, followed by outdoor emergency care(OEC) training. More rigorous training provides thewilderness first responder (WFR), the wilderness emer-gency medical technician (WEMC), or the wildernessprehospital emergency care (WPHEC) certifications. Themost advanced level of wilderness medical certificationis search and rescue (SAR) emergency care, which pro-vides expertise in a sophisticated array of rescue tech-niques and equipment.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAuerbach, Paul, MD.

Over time, these cellsbecome more specialized. The cells mature and organizeinto the normal kidney structure. Sometimes, clumps ofthese cells remain in their original, primitive form. Ifthese cells begin to multiply after birth, they may ulti-mately form a large mass of abnormal cells. This isknown as a Wilms’ tumor.\nWilms’ tumor is a type of malignant tumor. This\nmeans that it is made up of cells that are significantlyimmature and abnormal. These cells are also capable ofKEY TERMS\nAnaphylactic shock —Severe allergic reaction\ncharacterized by airway constriction, tissueswelling, and lowered blood pressure.\nCardiac arrest —Heart failure or heart attack.\nDislocation —Displacement of bones at a joint.\nEnvenomation —Exposure to venom by bites or\nstings from insects, reptiles, and fish.\nWilderness —Large backcountry areas lacking roads,\ncommunication and other modern infrastructure.invading nearby structures within the kidney and travel-\ning out of the kidney into other structures. Malignantcells can even travel through the body to invade otherorgan systems, most commonly the lungs and brain.These features of Wilms’ tumor make it a type of cancer\nthat, without treatment, would eventually cause death .\nHowever, advances in medicine during the last 20 yearshave made Wilms’ tumor a very treatable form of cancer.\nWilms’ tumor occurs almost exclusively in young\nchildren. The average patient is about three years old.Females are only slightly more likely than males todevelop Wilms’ tumors. In the United States, Wilms’tumor occurs in 8.3 individuals per million in whitechildren under the age of 15 years. The rate is higheramong African-Americans and lower among Asian-Americans. Wilms’ tumors are found more commonlyin patients with other types of birth defects . These\ndefects include:\n• absence of the colored part (the iris) of the eye (aniridia)\n• enlargement of one arm, one leg, or half of the face\n(hemihypertrophy) \n• certain birth defects of the urinary system or genitals\n• certain genetic syndromes (WAGR syndrome, Denys-\nDrash syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome)\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of Wilms’ tumor is not completely under-\nstood. Because 15% of all patients with this type oftumor have other heritable defects, it seems clear that atleast some cases of Wilms’ tumor may be due to an herit-ed alteration. It appears that the tendency to develop aWilms’ tumor can run in families. In fact, about 1.5% ofall children with a Wilms’ tumor have family memberswho have also had a Wilms’ tumor. The genetic mecha-nisms associated with the disease are unusually complex.\nSome patients with Wilms’ tumor experience\nabdominal pain , nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure,\nor blood in the urine. However, the parents of many chil-dren with this type of tumor are the first to notice a firm,rounded mass in their child’s abdomen. This discovery isoften made while bathing or dressing the child and fre-quently occurs before any other symptoms appear.Rarely, a Wilms’ tumor is diagnosed after there has beenbleeding into the tumor, resulting in sudden swelling ofthe abdomen and a low red blood cell count (anemia).\nAbout 5% of Wilms’ tumor cases involve both kid-\nneys during the initial evaluation. The tumor appears oneither side equally. When pathologists look at thesetumor cells under the microscope, they see great diversi-ty in the types of cells. Some types of cells are associated\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3564Wilms’ tumorwith a more favorable outcome in the patient than others.\nIn about 15% of cases, physicians find some degree ofcancer spread (metastasis). The most common sites inthe body where metastasis occurs are the liver and lungs.\nResearchers have found evidence that certain types\nof lesions occur before the development of the Wilms’tumor. These lesions usually appear in the form of stro-mal, tubule, or blastemal cells.\nDiagnosis\nChildren with Wilms’ tumor generally first present\nto physicians with a swollen abdomen or with an obviousabdominal mass. The physician may also find that thechild has fever , bloody urine, or abdominal pain. The\nphysician will order a variety of tests before imaging isperformed. These tests mostly involve blood analysis inthe form of a white blood cell count, complete blood\ncount ,platelet count , and serum calcium evaluation.\nLiver and kidney function testing will also be performedas well as a urinalysis .\nInitial diagnosis of Wilms’ tumor is made by looking\nat the tumor using various imaging techniques. Ultra-sound and computed tomography scans (CT scans) are\nhelpful in diagnosing Wilms’ tumor. Intravenous pyelog-raphy, where a dye injected into a vein helps show thestructures of the kidney, can also be used in diagnosingthis type of tumor. Final diagnosis, however, depends onobtaining a tissue sample from the mass (biopsy), andexamining it under a microscope in order to verify that ithas the characteristics of a Wilms’ tumor. This biopsy isusually done during surgery to remove or decrease thesize of the tumor. Other studies (chest x rays, CT scan ofthe lungs, bone marrow biopsy) may also be done inorder to see if the tumor has spread to other locations.\nTreatment\nTreatment for Wilms’ tumor almost always begins\nwith surgery to remove or decrease the size of the kidneytumor. Except in patients who have tumors in both kid-neys, this surgery usually will require complete removalof the affected kidney. During surgery, the surroundinglymph nodes, the area around the kidneys, and the entireabdomen will also be examined. While the tumor canspread to these surrounding areas, it is less likely to do socompared to other types of cancer. In cases where thetumor affects both kidneys, surgeons will try to preservethe kidney with the smaller tumor by removing only aportion of the kidney, if possible. Additional biopsies ofthese areas may be done to see if the cancer has spread.The next treatment steps depend on whether/where thecancer has spread. Samples of the tumor are also exam-ined under a microscope to determine particular charac-\nteristics of the cells making up the tumor.\nInformation about the tumor cell type and the spread\nof the tumor is used to decide the best kind of treatmentfor a particular patient. Treatment is usually a combina-tion of surgery, medications used to kill cancer cells(chemotherapy ), and x rays or other high-energy rays\nused to kill cancer cells ( radiation therapy ). These ther-\napies are called adjuvant therapies, and this type of com-bination therapy has been shown to substantially improveoutcome in patients with Wilms’ tumor. It has long beenknown that Wilms’ tumors respond to radiation therapy.Likewise, some types of chemotherapy have been foundto be effective in treating Wilms’ tumor. These effectivedrugs include dactinomycin, doxorubicin, vincristine,and cyclophosphamide. In rare cases, bone marrow\ntransplantation may be used.\nThe National Wilms’ Tumor Study Group has devel-\noped a staging system to describe Wilms’ tumors. All ofthe stages assume that surgical removal of the tumor hasoccurred. Stage I involves “favorable” Wilms’ tumor cellsand is usually treated successfully with combinationchemotherapy involving dactinomycin and vincristine andwithout abdominal radiation therapy. Stage II tumors\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3565Wilms’ tumor\nWilm’s tumor\nWilm’s tumor. (Illustration by Argosy, Inc.)involving a favorable histology (cell characteristics) are\nusually treated with the same therapy as Stage I. Stage IIItumors with favorable histology are usually treated with acombination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, dactino-mycin, and vincristine along with radiation therapy to theabdomen. Stage IV disease with a favorable histology isgenerally treated with combination chemotherapy withdactinomycin, doxorubicin, and vincristine. These patientsusually receive abdominal radiation therapy and lung radi-ation therapy if the tumor has spread to the lungs.\nIn the case of Stage II through IV tumors with unfa-\nvorable, or anaplastic, cells, then the previously-men-tioned combination chemotherapy is used along with thedrug cyclophosphamide. These patients also receive lungradiation therapy if the tumor has spread to the lungs.Another type of tumor cell can be present in Stages Ithrough IV . This cell type is called clear cell sarcoma ofthe kidney. If this type of cell is present, then patientsreceive combination therapy with vincristine, doxoru-bicin, and dactinomycin. All of these patients receiveabdominal radiation therapy and lung radiation therapy ifthe tumor has spread to the lungs.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for patients with Wilms’ tumor is\nquite good, compared to the prognosis for most types ofcancer.

    "title": "Wilson disease",
    "content": "Wilson disease\nDefinition\nWilson disease is a rare, inherited disorder that caus-\nes excess copper to accumulate in the body. Steadilyincreasing amounts of copper circulating in the blood aredeposited primarily in the brain, liver, kidneys, and thecornea of the eyes.\nDescription\nUnder normal conditions, copper that finds its way\ninto the body through the diet is processed within the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3566Wilson diseaseliver. This processed form of copper is then passed into\nthe gallbladder, along with the other components of bile(a fluid produced by the liver, which enters the smallintestine in order to help in digestive processes). Whenthe gallbladder empties its contents into the first part ofthe small intestine (duodenum), the copper in the bileenters and passes through the intestine with the wasteproducts of digestion. In healthy individuals, copper isthen passed out of the body in stool.\nIn Wilson disease, copper does not pass from the liver\ninto the bile, but rather begins to accumulate within theliver. As copper levels rise in the liver, the damaged organbegins to allow copper to flow into the bloodstream, whereit circulates. Copper is then deposited throughout thebody, building up primarily in the kidneys, the brain andnervous system, and the eyes. Wilson disease, then, is adisorder of copper poisoning occurring from birth.\nWilson disease affects approximately one in 30,000\nto one in 100,000 individuals and can affect people frommany different populations. Approximately one in 90individuals are carriers of the gene for Wilson disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nWilson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive\nmanner. Autosomal recessive refers to the pattern ofinheritance where each parent carries a gene for the dis-ease on one of his or her chromosome pairs. When eachparent passes on the chromosome with the gene for Wil-son disease, the child will be affected with the disease.Both males and females can be affected with Wilson dis-ease. If an individual is a carrier of the Wilson diseasegene they do not have any symptoms of this disease. Inorder to be affected, an individual must inherit twocopies of the gene, one from each parent. Many cases ofWilson disease may not be inherited but occur as a spon-taneous mutation in the gene.\nThe gene for Wilson disease is located on chromo-\nsome number 13. The name of the gene is called ATP7Band is thought to be involved in transporting copper. As of2001, over 70 different mutations of this gene have beenidentified, making diagnosis by genetic testing difficult.\nSymptoms typically present between the ages of\nthree and 60 with age 17 considered to be the averageage a diagnosis is made. About half of all patients experi-ence their first symptoms in the liver. The illness causesswelling and tenderness of the liver, sometimes withfever , mimicking more common disorders, such as viral\nhepatitis and infectious mononucleosis . Abnormal lev-\nels of circulating liver enzymes reveal that the liver isbeing seriously damaged. This form of damage isreferred to as “fatty degeneration.” Without medicalintervention, the liver damage will progress to actual cir-\nrhosis . An often-fatal manifestation of liver disease is\ncalled fulminant hepatitis. This extremely severe inflam-mation of the liver (hepatitis) results in jaundice , fluid\nleaking into the abdomen, low protein circulating in theblood, abnormalities of the blood clotting system,swelling of the brain, and anemia due to the abnormaldestruction of red blood cells.\nNeurological symptoms are the first to occur in half\nof all patients due to copper accumulation in the brain andnervous system. The average age of onset for neurologicalsymptoms is 21. These symptoms include tremors of the\nhands, uncontrollable movements of the limbs, stiffness,drooling, difficulty swallowing, difficulty talking, andheadache . There is no change in patient’s intelligence.\nAbout one third of all patients with Wilson disease\nhave a variety of psychiatric symptoms as the first signsof the disease. These symptoms include inability to cope,depression, irritability, increased anger, and inappropri-ate behavior. Often times patients have trouble complet-ing tasks at work or in school.\nOther symptoms that can affect patients with Wilson\ndisease, and may occur before or after a diagnosis hasbeen made include joint disorders, symptoms of arthritisand skeletal problems such as osteoporosis . Patients\nhave occasionally been affected with kidney stones ,\nabnormal handling of glucose in their body and womenhave menstrual cycle irregularities including stoppingtheir regular cycle temporarily.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of Wilson disease can be performed\nrelatively easily through several different tests howeverbecause Wilson disease is so rare, diagnosis is oftenunfortunately delayed. The tests used to diagnose Wilsondisease can be performed on patients who have and whohave not already shown symptoms of the disease. It isextremely important to make a diagnosis as soon as pos-sible since liver damage can occur before there are anysigns of the disease.\nAn easy way to diagnose Wilson disease is to mea-\nsure the amount of a glycoprotein found in the bloodcalled ceruloplasmin. Low levels of ceruloplasmin candiagnose the disease in about 80% of affected patients.This procedure is not as effective for women taking birthcontrol pills, pregnant women, or infants less than sixmonths of age.\nA second test involving an eye examination to\ndetect a characteristic ring of copper deposited in a mem-brane of the cornea (referred to as Kayser-Fleischerrings)is very easy to perform and is very useful in diag-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3567Wilson diseasenosing patients who have already exhibited symptoms.\nThis test is not as effective in persons without symptoms.This diagnostic test cannot be used by itself to make adiagnosis because some patients with liver disease butnot Wilson disease will test positive.\nA third test for diagnosing Wilson disease involves\nmeasuring the amount of copper in the liver. This can beaccomplished by sampling a portion of the liver, called abiopsy. This is one of the most effective ways in which todiagnose Wilson disease, however the procedure itself ismore difficult to perform than the others.\nOther tests are also useful, for example measuring\nthe amount of copper passed into the urine daily (high inWilson disease). Another lab test measures the ability ofa patient’s ceruloplasmin to bind with a form of copper(decreased in Wilson disease). And finally, as discussedunder genetic profile, some patients can be diagnosedthrough a DNA test to determine whether or not theyKEY TERMS\nAnemia —A blood condition in which the level of\nhemoglobin or the number of red blood cells fallsbelow normal values.

Both of thesedrugs remove copper deposits throughout the body bybinding to the copper which is removed through the bodyin urine. Zinc acetate and a low copper diet are otherways in which to treat Wilson disease.\nPenicillamine has a number of serious side effects:\n• joint pain• neurological problems• systemic lupus erythematosus• decreased production of all blood elements\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3568Wilson disease• interference with clotting\n• allergic reactions\nCareful monitoring is necessary. When patients have\nside effects from penicillamine, the dose can sometimesbe lowered to an effective level that causes fewer diffi-culties. Alternatively, steroid medications may berequired to reduce certain sensitivity reactions. Trientinehas fewer potential side effects, but must still be careful-ly monitored.\nTreatment with zinc is also an effective way to\nremove excess copper from the body. Zinc is a metal thatworks to block copper absorption and bind copper in theintestinal cells until it is all released into the stoolapproximately one week later. The benefit of treatmentwith zinc is there are no toxic side effects however thezinc is a slower acting agent than the other drugs. It takesfour to eight months for the zinc to be effective in reduc-ing the overall amount of copper in the body.\nFinally, patients with Wilson disease are encouraged\nto follow a diet low in copper, with an average copperintake of 1.0 mg/day. Foods to be avoided for the highlevels of copper include liver and shellfish. Patients arealso instructed to monitor their drinking water for excesslevels of copper and drink distilled water instead.\nPrognosis\nWithout treatment, Wilson disease is always fatal.\nWith treatment, symptoms may continue to worsen for thefirst six to eight weeks. After this time, definite improve-ment should begin to be seen. However, it may take sever-al years (two to five) of treatment to reach maximal benefitto the brain and liver. Even then, many patients are notreturned to their original level of functioning. Patients withWilson disease need to maintain some sort of anticoppertreatment for the rest of their lives in order to prevent cop-per levels from rising in the body. Interruptions in treat-ment can result in a relapse of the disease which is notreversible, and can ultimately lead to death .\nResources\nBOOKS\nScheinberg, I.

    "title": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome",
    "content": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome\nDefinition\nWiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare inherited\ndisorder marked by a low level of blood platelets,eczema, recurrent infections, and a high risk of leukemiaor lymph node tumors.\nDescription\nWAS was named for the two physicians who first\nreported the disorder. In 1937, Dr. A. Wiskott, a physi-cian working in Munich, described two affected boys ofGerman ancestry who had repeated infections, a skinrash, and poor blood-clotting ability. Nearly twenty yearslater, Dr. R.A. Aldrich reported similar symptoms inmembers of an American family of Dutch ancestry.\nWAS is inherited as an X-linked genetic disorder\nand will therefore only affect males. The gene responsi-ble for WAS is located on the short arm of the X chro-mosome. Since males have only one X chromosomethey only have one copy of the gene. If that copy carriesthe abnormal gene, they will have WAS. In contrast,females have two X chromosomes. They will have anormal copy of the gene on one chromosome even if anabnormal gene is on the other because the abnormalgene is very rare. The normal copy on one X chromo-some is usually sufficient to prevent females from hav-ing WAS. However, women who have one abnormalcopy of the WAS gene are designated as carriers. Whilethey will not have WAS, they have a 50% risk of pass-ing the gene to each of their sons who will have WAS.Carrier females also have a 50% risk of passing thedefective copy of the gene to their daughters who alsobecome carriers.”\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3569Wiskott-Aldrich syndromeResearchers identified the gene for WAS in 1994\nand pinpointed its location on the short arm of the Xchromosome. As of 2000, over 100 different mutationshave been found in the gene among WAS patients. Thefact that there are many mutations many explain some ofthe variability of symptoms among boys with WAS.However, even within the same family, affected individu-als with the identical WAS gene mutation may have dif-ferent degrees of severity of the disease. The mild form,X-linked thrombocytopenia , is also caused by muta-\ntions in this same gene.\nThe WAS syndrome affects one in every 250,000\nmale children and occurs worldwide. In the year 2000,scientists estimated that about 500 Americans have WAS.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe syndrome is caused by a defect (mutation) in a\nspecific gene called the WAS gene that normally codesfor the protein named Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein(WASP). This vital protein is a component of cells thatare important in the body’s defense against infection(lymphocytes). The same protein also functions in thecells that help prevent bleeding (platelets). A less severeform of the disease, X-linked thrombocytopenia affectsmainly the platelets.\nIncreased susceptibility to infections, eczema, and\nexcessive bleeding are the hallmarks of WAS, althoughthe symptoms can vary signficantly from one patient toanother. The immune system of patients with WAS pro-duces too few B and T cells. B cells are the cells in thebody that make antibodies. There are many types of Tcells. Both B and T cells are needed to defend the bodyagainst infection. Because both types of cells are affect-ed, WAS patients are subject to repeated infections frombacteria, fungi, and viruses. Ear infections, meningitis ,\nand pneumonia are common in boys with WAS.\nWAS patients also have thrombocytopenia, a\ndecreased number of platelets. Platelets are the special-ized blood cells that help to form blood clots and preventuncontrolled bleeding. The platelets may also be smallerthan normal. Some of the earliest symptoms of the syn-drome are hemorrhage from circumcision , bloody diar-\nrhea , and a tendency to bruise very easily.\nAnemia and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) are\nseen in some patients. About 10% of patients developmalignancies, usually leukemia or tumors in the lymphnodes (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma).\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of WAS is usually suspected in male\ninfants who have excessive bleeding, eczema, and fre-quent bacterial or viral infections. Special blood tests can\nthen be ordered to confirm WAS. The blood of Wiskott-Aldrich patients will show a low platelet count and a\nweak immune (antibody) response. It is also possible toconfirm the diagnosis by obtaining a small sample of thepatient’s blood and analyzing the DNA for a mutation inthe WAS gene. Knowledge of the exact mutation com-bined with information about how much WAS protein thedefective gene can produce may help predict how severea form of the disease an individual will have.\nCarrier Testing\nIf the specific WAS gene mutation is identified in an\naffected child, that child’s mother can then be tested toconfirm that she carries the gene. Other members of themother’s family may also want to consider testing to findout if they carry the same gene mutation. The first step instudying other family members is for a geneticist orgenetic counselor to obtain a detailed family history andconstruct a pedigree (family tree) to determine whichfamily members should be offered testing.\nPrenatal Diagnosis\nIn families where there has been one child born with\nWAS, prenatal testing should be offered in subsequentpregnancies. There 50% chance with each subsequentpregnancy that the mother, who is a carrier, will transmit\nthe abnormal copy of the gene to her baby. The key is tofirst identify the particular WAS gene mutation in thechild with WAS. Then, early in a pregnancy, cells can beobtained from the developing fetus by chorionic villus\nsampling or amniocentesis , and checked for the same\nmutation. Women who carry the abnormal WAS geneand are considering prenatal diagnosis should discuss therisks and benefits of this type of testing with a geneticistor genetic counselor.\nTreatment\nStandard treatments for individuals with WAS\ninclude antibiotics for infections and platelet transfu-\nsions to limit bleeding. Immune globulin is given tostrengthen the individual’s immune system. Eczema canbe treated with corticosteroid creams applied directly tothe skin. The spleen is sometimes removed to reduce therisk of bleeding. In individuals with WAS, however,removal of the spleen also increases the risk of infectionunless antibiotics are given to prevent infections. About50% of individuals with WAS are helped by treatmentwith transfer factor, which is a substance derived fromthe T cells of a healthy person. Transfer factor is given toimprove both blood clotting and immune functions.Bone marrow transplantation has been successful in a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3570Wiskott-Aldrich syndromenumber of cases. It has been most successful in boys\nunder five years of age where the donor is a siblingwhose tissue type closely matches that of the individualwith WAS. As of 2000, attempts were also being made totreat individuals with WAS with umbilical cord bloodfrom unrelated newborns in cases where the individualdiagnosed with WAS has no matched sibling donor.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for males diagnosed with Wiskott-\nAdrich syndrome is poor. The average individual livesabout four years; those who survive into adolescence oftendevelop cancer . Death usually occurs from severe bleed-\ning or overwhelming infection in the first few years of life.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBelmont, J. W., and J. M.

This process of eliminating drugsand alcohol from the body is known as detoxification .\nAnxiety ,insomnia , nausea, perspiration, body aches,\nand tremors are just a few of the physical and psycho-\nlogical symptoms of drug and alcohol withdrawal thatmay occur during detoxification.\nDescription\nDrugs and alcohol affect mood by altering brain\nchemistry, specifically the production of neurotransmit-ters. Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the central ner-vous system that enable nerve impulses to travel throughthe central nervous system and regulate thought process-es, behavior, and emotion. Drugs that temporarily elevateneurotransmitter levels are called stimulants. Drugs thatdecrease neurotransmitter levels and depress the centralnervous system are called depressants; they include opi-ates and sedative-hypnotic drugs such as alcohol andbarbiturates . (There are exceptions: Benzodiazepine\nelevates the level of an inhibitory neurotransmitter,GABA, therefore it serves as a tranquilizer)\nWhen drug or alcohol consumption becomes chron-\nic, the body adjusts to the constant presence of the sub-stance by changing its normal production of neurotrans-mitters. If drug and alcohol use suddenly stops, the bodyand central nervous system react to the absence of thesubstance with an array of symptoms known collectivelyas withdrawal syndrome.\nCauses and symptoms\nAcute withdrawal syndrome begins within hours of\nabstinence, and includes a full range of physical and psy-chological symptoms. More long-term, or subacute, with-drawal symptoms, such as intense drug craving, may occurweeks or months after detoxification has taken place.\nAlcohol withdrawal\nAlcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in alcohol-\ndependent individuals who suddenly stop or dramaticallyreduce their alcohol intake. The onset of the syndrome islikely to occur within a week, but usually occurs within 24hours of the individual’s last drink, and is triggered whenthe central nervous system attempts to adjust to the suddenabsence of ethyl alcohol in the body. Symptoms mayinclude extreme anxiety, disorientation, hallucinations ,sleep disorders , hand tremors, nausea, sweating, seizures,\nand racing pulse. Delirium tremens (DTs) are an extreme\nexample of withdrawal. In the worst cases, untreated alco-hol withdrawal syndrome can result in death .\nBarbiturate withdrawal\nBarbiturates are prescribed as anticonvulsants, seda-\ntives, and general anesthetics. They can also mimic someof the characteristics of alcohol intoxication (includingeuphoria, elation, and uninhibited behavior), which makethem candidates for abuse. Commonly abused barbituratesinclude amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal),and secobarbital (Seconal). These drugs depress the respi-ratory and nervous system functions; and, because abusersrapidly build up a tolerance to the effects of the drug, fataloverdose or coma can easily occur. Symptoms of with-\ndrawal syndrome appear 12-20 hours after the last dose;they include anxiety, irritability, elevated heart and respira-tion rate, muscle pain , nausea, tremors, hallucinations,\nconfusion, and seizures. Death is a possibility if the condi-tion is left untreated. Because barbiturates decrease REMsleep (rapid eye movement sleep, during which dreamingtakes place), withdrawal often results in sleep disruptionssuch as nightmares, insomnia, or vivid dreaming.\nOpiate withdrawal\nOpiates are powerfully addictive analgesic drugs\nthat deaden nerve pathways related to pain. Abusers ofpropoxyphene (Darvon), meperidine (Demerol), perco-cet (Oxycodone), heroin, morphine, and other powerfullyaddictive opiates quickly build up a tolerance to thedrugs and need progressively larger doses to achieve thedesired effect. Stopping or reducing the intake of thedrug can cause severe withdrawal symptoms, whichbegin six to eight hours after the last dosage. Symptomsare flu-like, and include gastrointestinal distress, anxiety,nausea, insomnia, muscle pain, fevers, sweating, andrunny nose and eyes.\nStimulant withdrawal\nUse of stimulants, such as cocaine , crack, ampheta-\nmines, and methamphetamines, cause an increase in neu-rotransmitters in the central nervous system and producefeelings of alertness and increased energy. This initial“rush” is followed by a longer period of neurotransmitterloss, characterized by depression, lethargy, and a cravingfor more stimulants—sometimes called a rebound effect.When a stimulant-dependent individual abstains fromstimulant use, withdrawal symptoms, including depres-sion, fatigue , insomnia, and loss of appetite, reflect this\ndrop in neurotransmitter levels. Withdrawal typicallytakes one to two weeks.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3572Withdrawal syndromesDiagnosis\nA detailed history of the patient’s drug or alcohol\nuse taken before detoxification can be helpful in predict-ing the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Standardizedclinical tests, such as the Clinical Institute WithdrawalAssessment for Alcohol, revised, (CIWA-Ar), are used toevaluate the severity of withdrawal symptoms throughoutthe detoxification procedure.\nTreatment\nPharmacologic and medical management is often\nrecommended for withdrawal syndrome. The physicalcondition of the patient is closely monitored throughoutthe detoxification procedure.\nAlcohol withdrawal\nAlcohol withdrawal syndrome can be treated at\nhome or in a hospital or treatment setting. Inpatient treat-ment is recommended for patients who are at risk forserious withdrawal symptoms or re-intoxication if treat-ed as an outpatient. Withdrawal symptoms are minimizedthrough the administration of cross-tolerant sedatives.Long-acting benzodiazepines , such as diazepam (Vali-\num), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and lorazepam (Ati-van), are the pharmacologic treatment of choice in man-aging the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Drug dosageis adjusted to offset the discomfort of withdrawal, with-out causing a euphoric effect, and is then graduallydecreased as withdrawal symptoms lessen.\nBarbiturate withdrawal\nBecause the risk for seizures and other severe com-\nplications is high, barbiturate withdrawal should be mon-itored in a hospital setting. Patients are given low dosesof phenobarbital at a regular interval until mild intoxica-tion is achieved. The dosage amount and frequency isthen gradually decreased until withdrawal is complete.\nOpiate withdrawal\nTwo basic treatment approaches are used for manag-\ning opiate withdrawal. The first involves treating thesymptoms of the withdrawal with appropriate medication.Clondine, an antihypertensive drug, is commonly pre-scribed to reduce muscle pain and cramping. Other symp-tom-specific drugs are administered on an as-needed basis.\nThe second treatment option is to replace the\npatient’s drug of choice with methadone , a long-acting,\ncross-tolerant opiate that does not normally produce a“high.” Doses of methadone are administered every fourto six hours. The patient’s reaction is closely observed,and dosages are slowly decreased until withdrawal symp-KEY TERMS\nAnalgesics —Pain killing drugs that depress respi-\nratory function. Opiates are analgesics.\nAntagonist —A substance that tends to nullify the\naction of another.\nBenzodiazepines —Sedatives used to treat anxiety,\nepilepsy, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome.Diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), and chlor-diazepoxide (Librium) are all benzodiazepines.\nCross-tolerant —A drug that has the same pharma-\ncological effect as another is considered cross-tol-erant. Cross-tolerant drugs are often used in treat-ing withdrawal syndromes.\nDetoxification —The process of physically elimi-\nnating drugs and/or alcohol from the system of asubstance-dependent individual.\nDysphoria —A depressed and anxious mood state.\nNeurotransmitters —Chemicals in the brain that\naffect the nervous system and alter thinking patterns. \nOpiates —Analgesic, pain killing drugs, such as\nheroin and morphine that depress the central ner-vous system.\ntoms have disappeared, and dosages are then discontin-\nued. Methadone withdrawal can be completed withinthree weeks. It is important to note that methadone with-drawal treatment differs from a methadone maintenanceprogram, in which patients who are unwilling to give upopiates are prescribed methadone as a legal, long-termsubstitute for their drug of choice.\nRapid opiate detoxification (ROD) is an emerging\ntreatment option for opiate withdrawal. The RODmethod is reported to be faster and to cause less physicaldiscomfort than traditional forms of opiate detoxifica-tion. The treatment is typically performed in a hospital orprivate clinic setting. Naltrexone, an opiate antagonisticthat blocks opiate receptors and reverses the effects ofopiates, is administered to trigger the withdrawalresponse. Clonidine is given simultaneously to ease thesymptoms of withdrawal. The patient is anesthetizedthroughout the three to four hour procedure, and with-drawal occurs while the patient sleeps. Vital signs aremonitored closely and a ventilator may be employed.\nStimulant withdrawal\nBecause of the depression and dysphoria (feeling of\na psychological low) related to stimulant withdrawal,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3573Withdrawal syndromespsychological and/or medical management is critical.\nTreatment may include a regimen of drugs that increaseneurotransmitter production.\nPrognosis\nA closely observed, medically managed detoxifica-\ntion typically results in a safe and tolerable withdrawalexperience for the patient. Detoxification is only ashort-term solution for obtaining abstinence. An addic-\ntion treatment and long-term recovery program is nec-\nessary to achieve long-term sobriety. Without such atreatment program, the likelihood of recurrence ofabuse and, therefore, the recurrence of withdrawal syn-drome is high.\nPrevention\nAfter detoxification, alcohol and drug dependent\nindividuals are encouraged to maintain their abstinencethrough participation in substance abuse treatment or atwelve-step recovery program.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLandry, Mim J.

The abnormality affects the electricalsignal between the atria and ventricles.\nDescription\nBlood is circulated through the heart and body by a\nmuscular pump and valve system involving the atria andventricles. The right atrium receives oxygen-lackingblood returning to the heart from the body. The blood ispassed from the right atrium into the right ventricle,which contracts and sends blood out to the pulmonaryartery. The pulmonary artery sends the blood into thelungs, where carbon dioxide is removed, and fresh oxy-gen is added. The left atrium receives blood with oxygenfrom the lungs and passes this arterial blood to the leftventricle, where it is emptied into the aorta, the mainartery of the heart.\nThese functions are directed by electrical signals\nwithin the heart. In patients afflicted with Wolff-Parkin-son-White syndrome, an abnormal pathway exists thatcauses additional electrical signals to pass between theatria and ventricles, possibly causing rapid heart rate.\nCauses and symptoms\nCongenital heart disease may contribute to this and\nother arrhythmias . Ebstein’s anomaly, a congenital\nheart defect that involves displacement of the tricuspidvalve, located on the right side of the heart, is one knowncause of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. This anom-aly allows blood to flow via the small hole to the otherside of the heart. Often, there is no known cause forWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Many people with thesyndrome have no symptoms. On the other hand, somepeople experience temporary rapid heartbeat due to cer-tain drugs, smoking , and anxiety .\nDiagnosis\nElectrocardiography (ECG) is used to diagnose\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and other cardiacarrhythmias. A trained physician, normally a cardiolo-gist, can recognize patterns of electrical conduction.With this syndrome, the extra pathway will show a pat-tern different from those of normal conduction. If noirregular patterns show on the ECG, the patient may be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3574Wolff-Parkinson-White syndromesent home with a 24-hour heart monitor, called a Holter\nmonitor, which will help detect intermittent occur-rences. Other studies, such as the cardiac electrophysio-logic study (EPS), may be ordered to pinpoint the loca-tion of the accessory pathway, and to determine a courseof treatment.\nTreatment\nVarious drugs may be used to treat Wolff-Parkinson-\nWhite syndrome, as well as other cardiac arrhythmias.The purpose of these drugs is to slow the electrical sig-nals and excitation of heart muscles. As some of thesedrugs may have side effects, including the rare produc-tion of new or more frequent arrhythmias, the patientshould be carefully observed. Ablative therapies may beaccomplished with radiofrequency or cardiac catheters tocut through the tissue which is causing the abnormalelectrical signals.\nAt one time, only open heart surgery was used, but\nthe procedure can be done now with local anesthesia in aspecial cardiac laboratory. In some cases, surgery maystill be recommended to treat Wolff-Parkinson-Whitesyndrome.Young people with this syndrome may betreated more successfully with surgery, rather thanenduring a lifetime of drug treatments, or the possiblethreat of sudden cardiac death .\nAlternative treatment\nA provider may teach patients methods to help con-\ntrol heart rate. Relaxation techniques, acupuncture ,\nbotanical medicine, and homeopathy can all be helpful\nsupportive therapies.\nPrognosis\nMost patients with this syndrome can lead normal\nlives, even with episodes of tachycardia. In many cases,the syndrome is secondary to the underlying congenitalheart defect. However, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndromecan cause sudden cardiac arrest in certain instances.\nPrevention\nIf the syndrome is not due to congenital heart dis-\nease, the patient may try avoiding behaviors which leadto arrhythmia, such as elimination of caffeine , alcohol,\ncocaine , and smoking.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCurrent Diagnosis.

The average lifeexpectancy has almost doubled for women (79 years forwomen and 73 years for men), when compared withaverages during the turn of the century. Because of thegender gap in lifespan, women comprise approximatelytwo thirds of the population older than 65 and threefourths of the population aged 85 years and older. Cur-rently the fastest growing group in the United States ispersons aged 85 years and older. Because of gender lifeexpectancy differences, it is estimated that at the begin-ning of the twenty-first century, women will outnumbermen in the 85 years and older category by 3:1. The rea-sons for this variance are primarily due to physiologicaldifferences among men and women.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3575Women’s healthDuring different phases of a women’s life cycle\nthere are complex interactions that exist between sex hor-mones, physiological changes, and emotional issues.Physiological changes occur as early as embryonicdevelopment when hormones program structural differ-ences between male and female brains. During reproduc-tive years, sex hormones profoundly influence reproduc-tion and development, which creates a spectrum of gen-der specific health issues. With advancing age and onsetof menopause , women’s risk factors for disease is com-\nparably similar to men’s. Although the same disease mayaffect women as men, it is thought that biological mecha-nisms and psychosocial differences influence the clinicalcourse of the disease (natural history) differently inwomen. The number of women working has doubledwithin the past 50 years. The effect of work stress ,n e w\nenvironmental exposures and multiple roles is expectedto have health and social impact.\nThe leading causes of death among women are car-\ndiovascular disease, malignant cancer , cerebrovascular\ndisease, chronic lung disease, pneumonia/influenza, anddiabetes. Additionally, women can be prone to osteo-\nporosis , alcohol abuse, psychological disorders, human\nimmunodeficiency virus infection, and violence.\nHeart Disease accounts for approximately a third of\nall deaths in women. About 250,000 women die annuallyof coronary heart disease or a one in three chance afterage 40 years. The incidence of heart disease occurs about10 years later in women than in men, since estrogens inpremenopausal women has a protective effect. AfricanAmerican women are more prone to die from heart dis-ease up to age 75. Beyond 75 years of age the propensityis reversed. Native American and Hispanic women havelower death rates from heart disease. \nMalignant cancers are the most common cause of\npremature death among women. Breast cancer is the\nsecond leading cause of death in women and the mostcommonly diagnosed cancer. Lung cancer, secondary tocigarette smoking is the leading cause of cancer death\namong women. \nCerebrovascular disease, or stroked related deaths\naccount for approximately 6% of all deaths in womenand it is the third leading cause of mortality. The leastcommon form of stroke ,subarachnoid hemorrhage ,i s\nthe more common cause in women. \nThe prevalence of cigarette smoking has increased\ngreatly in women and this is correlated with pulmonarydisease. Death rates for pulmonary disease includingcancer and infectious causes of death are expected to risefor women.\nDiabetes, a leading cause of death in women is more\nprevalent among Hispanic, African American, and NativeAmerican women. Past age 45, diabetes affects about one\nin six women.\nWomen can also develop:\n• osteoporosis, or loss of the quantity of bone, common\nin postmenopausal women who have estrogen changes.\n• alcohol abuse, characterized by repeated usage of alco-\nhol despite negative consequences. These women fre-quently do not seek treatment because of fear of conse-quences (i.e., loss of child custody). This disease canalso have adverse affects on fertility and in the develop-ing fetus if the mother continues to consume alcohol(fetal alcohol syndrome).\n• psychological disorders, such as depression and eating\ndisorders.\n• acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ), which\nrepresents the highest percent increase in death rates.\n• violence, a leading cause of death, primarily caused by\na perpetrator who is or was a partner.\nCauses and symptoms\nCardiovascular disease can be caused by blockage of\na blood vessel, high blood pressure, or a secondary com-plication to another disease. There may be an abnormalheart rhythm or cell death. Patients may complain of abroad spectrum of symptoms that may include pain chest\ndiscomfort, high blood pressure, or strain during physicalexertion.\nWhen attempting to define the cause and symptoms\nof cancer, it is important to assess the type of cancer andlocation. Additionally, if the tumor is localized (benign)or has spread to other areas (malignant), is vital for treat-ment planning and overall prognosis. In cases of breastcancer there mat be a lump discovered during self-exami-nation or mammography (special breast x rays). \nCerebrovascular disease may cause tremors (shak-\ning), loss of balance and coordination, or functional andsensation loss of some parts of the body. Patients mayhave sudden transient strokes that could result in tempo-rary loss of consciousness and amnesia of the incident.\nPatients may also develop chronic neurological statesthat causing memory loss and behavioral changes(Alzheimer’s disease ). \nPatients with pulmonary (lung) cancer may develop\nshortness of breath ,fatigue , weight loss, worsening\ncough , and coughing up bright red blood with sputum.\nLung infections such as pneumonia may present with\nhigh fever , weakness, difficulty breathing, and abnormal\nbreathe sounds heard with a stethoscope during physical\nexamination .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3576Women’s healthDiabetes is a syndrome with disordered metabolism\nand high blood sugar due to an abnormality in the chemi-cal that regulates sugar levels. It is characterized by anincreased thirst, urination, and chronic skin infections.\nOsteoporosis may cause the bones to be brittle and\nweak. It is usually not detected until bones start to break.\nThe alcohol abuser will continue to drink despite neg-\native repercussions. The person may not seek treatment toevade legal and/or child custody problems. The patientmay hide alcohol, or confine drinking to specific times.The disease progresses to where there may be permanentliver damage, memory blackouts and malnutrition .\nDepression may manifest a loss of interest and desire.\nPatients may have difficulty getting out of bed. They maylack motivation to work or tend to daily activities.\nPatients with AIDS may not have symptoms for\nyears. When active disease occurs, patients will typical-ly develop recurrent infections that are the usual causeof death.\nDomestic violence is usually associated with a per-\npetrator who is in a relationship with the affected person.Abuse can be manifested by physical violence and/orhomicide.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis can be accomplished with a history, phys-\nical examination, and specialized tests or procedures. Forcardiovascular disease an electrocardiogram can deter-mine the activity of the heart. Additional tests mayinclude echocardiography (ultrasonic waves that gener-\nate an image), stress testing, and studies that requireplacing a catheter with a probe to examine the damage toheart tissue. Special tests with dyes may also be injectedto enhance visualization. Cancer may be detected usingspecialized test called tumor makers and imaging studiessuch as MRI and CAT scans. Cerebrovascular diseasecan be detected with a complete neurological examina-tion and specialized imaging technology. Diabetes isusually detected by a careful history presence of risk fac-tors ( obesity ) and blood analysis of glucose levels.\nOsteoporosis can be evaluated with specialized bonedensitometry. Alcohol abuse can be established by a bio-psycho-social assessment and standardized tests whichscreen for this disorder. Psychological evaluation (suchas the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ,\nMMPI) can usually detect depression or eating disorders.AIDS can be established by a careful history, belongingto high-risk groups and Western blot analysis (examina-tion of blood to detect the protein of human immunodefi-ciency virus). Violence can be established by physicalsigns of beating, such as cuts and bruises .Treatment\nTreatment depends on the extent of disease and the\npresent health status of the patient. Additionally, in somecases treatment may stopped at sometime, or it may alto-gether be refused. Treatment for cardiovascular diseasemay include surgical intervention and/or conservativemedical treatment with medications. Diet, exercise , and\nweight reduction are important parameters for treatmentplanning. Appropriate referrals, counseling, and follow upare usually indicated. Treatment for cancer may include acombination of surgery, chemotherapy or radiation\ntherapy . These treatment modalities may be given singly\nor in combination or at different times during disease pro-gression. Cerebrovascular disease can be treated surgical-ly and/or with medications that thin the blood. Sympto-matic care may be indicated in addition to close monitor-ing if the patient develops disability and/or cognitiveimpairment. Diabetes can be treated by dietary modifica-tions and medications, which treat abnormal levels ofblood glucose (sugar). Osteoporosis can be treatmentwith estrogen replacement and regular vitamin/mineralintake. Alcohol abuse may require long-term therapy,inpatient treatment and medications. Community cen-tered support group meeting are also recommended as aform of treatment maintenance. To date there is no treat-ment for AIDS, other than medications, that offer sympto-matic relief. Alcohol abuse, psychological disorders andviolence require therapy, possible medication, and com-munity centered support group meetings. \nAlternative treatment\nThere are numerous studies which support intake od\ncoenzyme Q10 for cardiovascular health. Studies haveshown that beta-carotene and vitamin E and C have noeffect for cancer. Some studies indicate positive resultsfor reproductive health using acupuncture . Some advo-\ncates proposed certain herbs may be beneficial duringmenopause. According to most medical literature, furtherresearch using scientific method is vital for generalacceptance. \nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the extent of disease and\nthe physical and emotional status of the patient. Progno-sis is also related to tolerance of treatment, adverse drugeffects, and complication during or after surgery, diseaseresurgence and patient compliance with treatment rec-ommendations.\nPrevention\nOne of the most reliable measures of prevention is\neducation and training. The Council on Graduate Medical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3577Women’s healthEducation has provided funding for numerous centers to\nresearch women health issues. On more individual levelpreventive and personal habits are vital for good health.Most physicians believe that a baseline physical examina-tion is a reliable comparative tool. Women should receivecounseling for special issues concerning cigarette smok-ing, exercise, diet, primary disease prevention, safe sexualpractices, alcohol abuse, psychological disorders, andviolence. Additionally, knowledge of family history isimportant since many diseases have a strong propensityamong first-degree relatives. Blood pressure should nor-mally be measured every other year. Screening tests forbreast, cervical, and colorectal cancer is recommended.Pap smears taken during routine pelvic examinations canscreen for disease processes in the reproductive tract.Serum cholesterol monitoring and reduction are advised.Patients may require postmenopausal estrogen replace-ment therapy and vitamin/mineral supplements.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDuthie, Edmund H., et al, eds.

    "content": "Wound culture\nDefinition\nA wound culture is a laboratory test in which\nmicroorganisms from a wound are grown in a specialKEY TERMS\nElectrocardiogram — An instrument that monitors\nheart rate and rhythm.growth medium. It is done to find and identify the\nmicroorganism causing an infection in a wound or anabscess . If a microorganism is found, more testing is\ndone to determine the antibiotics that will be effective in\ntreating the infection.\nPurpose\nWounds are injuries to body tissues caused by dis-\nease processes or events such as burns , punctures, and\nhuman or animal bites. Wounds or abscesses also occurwithin body tissues as a result of surgery or dental proce-dures. Wounds become infected when microorganismsfrom the outside environment, or from within the per-son’s body, enter the open wound and multiply. A woundthat is red, painful, swollen, and draining pus is probablyinfected. A fever following surgery indicates an infection\nat the site of surgery. \nTo enable healing and prevent the spread of infec-\ntion to other body tissues, the infecting microorganismsmust be killed. A wound culture discovers which type ofmicroorganism is causing the infection and the bestantibiotic with which to kill it.\nDescription\nA sample of material, such as pus or a portion of tis-\nsue, is taken from the wound, placed in a sterile contain-er, and sent to the laboratory. In the laboratory, this mate-rial is spread over the surface of several different types ofculture plates and placed in an incubator at body temper-ature for one to two days.\nA Gram stain is done by staining the slide with pur-\nple and red stains, then examining it under a micro-scope. If many white blood cells and bacteria are seen,it is an early confirmation of infection. The color ofstain retained by the bacteria (purple or red), their shape(such as round or rectangular), and their size providevaluable clues as to their identity, and help the physi-cian predict which antibiotics might work best evenbefore the entire test is completed. Bacteria that stainpurple are called gram-positive; those that stain red arecalled gram-negative.\nBacteria can be grouped into two categories: aerobes\nand anaerobes. Aerobes are bacteria that need oxygen tolive; anaerobes live only where there is no oxygen. Deepwounds, closed-off from oxygen, are an ideal environ-ment for an anaerobic infection to develop. Foul-smelling odor, gas, or gangrene at the infection site are\nsigns of an infection caused by an anaerobic bacteria.Routine cultures typically only look for aerobic bacteria.If the physician tells the laboratory to include a culturefor anaerobes, a portion of the wound sample will be put\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3578Wound cultureon culture plates, or in a tube of culture broth, and incu-\nbated in a special chamber without oxygen.\nBacteria present in the wound sample will multiply\nand appear as visible colonies on the plates, or as cloudi-ness in the tube of broth. They are identified by theappearance of their colonies, the results of biochemicaltests, and information from Gram staining part of thebacterial colony.\nA sensitivity test, also called an antibiotic suscepti-\nbility test, is also done. The bacteria are tested againstdifferent antibiotics to determine which will treat theinfection by killing the bacteria.\nIf the physician thinks the wound may be infected\nwith a mold or yeast, a fungal culture is also done. Thewound sample is spread on special culture plates that aretreated to encourage the growth of mold and yeast. Dif-ferent biochemical tests and stains are used to identifymolds and yeast.\nOther more unusual microorganisms, such as\nMycobacterium leprae , may be the cause of a wound\ninfection. The physician must notify the laboratory to cul-ture specifically for these more unusual microorganisms. \nThe initial Gram stain result is available the same\nday, or in less than an hour if requested by the physician.An early report, known as a preliminary report, is usuallyavailable after one day. This report will tell if anymicroorganisms have yet been found, and, if so, theirGram stain appearance. For example, they may have theappearance of a gram-negative rod, or a gram-positivecocci (spherical shape). The final report, usually avail-able in one to three days, includes complete identifica-tion, an estimate of the quantity of the microorganisms,plus a list of the antibiotics to which they are sensitive.Cultures for fungi and anaerobic bacteria may take twoto three weeks.\nWound culture is also called soft tissue culture,\nabscess culture, or wound culture and sensitivity. \nPreparation\nA piece of the infected tissue is the best specimen. If\nthis is not possible, the next best specimen is pus fromthe wound. Because many microorganisms normally liveon skin and mucous membrane, the specimen must notbe allowed to touch the area surrounding the wound.\nThe physician first cleans the surface of the wound\nusing alcohol. Using a syringe, the physician suctions out(aspirates) as much pus as possible from the wound.Next, this is sent to the laboratory in a sterile container. Ifit is impossible to aspirate the pus, pus from within thewound can be collected on a swab.KEY TERMS\nAerobe —Bacteria that require oxygen to live.\nAnaerobe —Bacteria that live only where there is\nno oxygen. \nNormal flora —The mixture of bacteria normally\nfound at specific body sites.\nThe physician may choose to start the person on an\nantibiotic before the culture and sensitivity tests are com-pleted. However, the specimen for culture should be col-lected before antibiotics are begun.

    "content": "Wound flushing\nDefinition\nWound flushing is a method of cleaning a wound by\napplying pressurized water or antiseptic solutions to thetissues.\nPurpose\nWound flushing is used to help flush debris from a\nwound, lessening the risk of infection or treating aninfection that already exists. If the wound is flushed withan antiseptic, it is more likely to heal correctly; flushingthe wound can help prevent the surface from healing overa possibly infected area underneath.\nDescription\nWound flushing is usually done in a hospital, though if\nit is performed at home, there is less chance of infectionbecause of the higher risk of bacterial contamination in thehospital environment. Wound flushing is especially helpfulin treating people with bites, lacerations, or crush injuries,which often become infected due to the presence of deadtissue and foreign debris, such as splinters or dirt. In a non-surgical situation, the procedure is usually performed by anurse. An acute injury, such as a crushing wound or knifecut, the wound is flushed right before the injury is stitchedclosed. For people with chronic wounds , such as bed sores\nor abscesses, the wound may be flushed periodically totreat or prevent infection. During an operation, a surgeonuses an antibacterial solution to flush the surgical site justbefore stitching the wound closed. After surgery, thewounds may be flushed to treat or prevent infection.\nPreparation\nThe nurse or doctor may inject the site with a local\nanesthetic before flushing the wound.\nAftercare\nAfter the wound is flushed, the health care provider\ncleans the area around the wound to guard against infec-KEY TERMS\nAntiseptic —Chemicals applied to the skin to\ndestroy bacteria and prevent infection.\ntion.

    "title": "Wounds",
    "content": "Wounds\nDefinition\nA wound occurs when the integrity of any tissue is\ncompromised (e.g. skin breaks, muscle tears, burns ,o r\nbone fractures ). A wound may be caused by an act, such\nas a gunshot, fall, or surgical procedure; by an infectiousdisease; or by an underlying condition.\nDescription\nTypes and causes of wounds are wide ranging, and\nhealth care professionals have several different ways ofclassifying them. They may be chronic, such as the skinulcers caused by diabetes mellitus , or acute, such as a\ngunshot wound or animal bite. Wounds may also bereferred to as open, in which the skin has been compro-mised and underlying tissues are exposed, or closed, inwhich the skin has not been compromised, but trauma tounderlying structures has occurred (e.g. a bruised rib or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3580Wound flushingcerebral contusion). Emergency personnel and first-aid\nworkers generally place acute wounds in one of eightcategories:\n• Abrasions. Also called scrapes, they occur when the\nskin is rubbed away by friction against another roughsurface (e.g. rope burns and skinned knees). \n• Avulsions. Occur when an entire structure or part of it\nis forcibly pulled away, such as the loss of a permanenttooth or an ear lobe. Explosions, gunshots, and animalbites may cause avulsions. \n• Contusions. Also called bruises , these are the result of\na forceful trauma that injures an internal structure with-out breaking the skin. Blows to the chest, abdomen, orhead with a blunt instrument (e.g. a football or a fist)can cause contusions. \n• Crush wounds. Occur when a heavy object falls onto a\nperson, splitting the skin and shattering or tearingunderlying structures.\n• Cuts. Slicing wounds made with a sharp instrument,\nleaving even edges. They may be as minimal as a papercut or as significant as a surgical incision. \n• Lacerations. Also called tears, these are separating\nwounds that produce ragged edges. They are producedby a tremendous force against the body, either from aninternal source as in childbirth , or from an external\nsource like a punch.\n• Missile wounds. Also called velocity wounds, they are\ncaused by an object entering the body at a high speed,typically a bullet.\n• Punctures. Deep, narrow wounds produced by sharp\nobjects such as nails, knives, and broken glass.\nCauses and symptoms\nAcute wounds have a wide range of causes. Often,\nthey are the unintentional results of motor vehicle acci-dents, falls, mishandling of sharp objects, or sports-relat-ed injury. Wounds may also be an intentional result ofviolence involving assault with weapons, including fists,knives, or guns.\nThe general symptoms of a wound are localized\npain and bleeding. Specific symptoms include:\n• An abrasion usually appears as lines of scraped skin\nwith tiny spots of bleeding.\n• An avulsion has heavy, rapid bleeding and a noticeable\nabsence of tissue. \n• A contusion may appear as a bruise beneath the skin or\nmay appear only on imaging tests; an internal woundmay also generate symptoms such as weakness, perspi-ration, and pain.• A crush wound may have irregular margins like a lacer-\nation; however, the wound will be deeper and trauma tomuscle and bone may be apparent.\n• A cut may have little or profuse bleeding depending on\nits depth and length; its even edges readily line up.\n• A laceration too may have little or profuse bleeding; the\ntissue damage is generally greater and the wound’sragged edges do not readily line up. \n• A missile entry wound may be accompanied by an exit\nwound, and bleeding may be profuse, depending on thenature of the injury.\n• A puncture wound will be greater than its length, therefore\nthere is usually little bleeding around the outside of thewound and more bleeding inside, causing discoloration.\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis is made by visual examination and may\nbe confirmed by a report of the causal events. Medicalpersonnel will also assess the extent of the wound andwhat effect it has had on the patient’s well being (e.g.profound blood loss, damage to the nervous system orskeletal system). \nTreatment\nTreatment of wounds involves stopping any bleed-\ning, then cleaning and dressing the wound to preventinfection. Additional medical attention may be requiredif the effects of the wound have compromised the body’sability to function effectively.\nStopping the bleeding\nMost bleeding may be stopped by direct pressure.\nDirect pressure is applied by placing a clean cloth or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3581Wounds\nA close-up of a hard-contact gunshot wound with accompa-\nnying burn marks on the left and right sides of the wound.(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)dressing over the wound and pressing the palm of the\nhand over the entire area. This limits local bleeding with-out disrupting a significant portion of the circulation. Thecloth absorbs blood and allows clot formation; the clotshould not be disturbed, so if blood soaks through thecloth, another cloth should be placed directly on toprather than replacing the original cloth. \nIf the wound is on an arm or leg that does not appear\nto have a broken bone, the wound should be elevated to aheight above the person’s heart while direct pressure isapplied. Elevating the wound allows gravity to slowdown the flow of blood to that area.\nIf severe bleeding cannot be stopped by direct pres-\nsure or with elevation, the next step is to apply pressureto the major artery supplying blood to the area of thewound. In the arm, pressure would be applied to thebrachial artery by pressing the inside of the upper armagainst the bone. In the leg, pressure would be applied tothe femoral artery by pressing on the inner crease of thegroin against the pelvic bone.\nIf the bleeding from an arm or leg is so extreme as to\nbe life-threatening and if it cannot be stopped by anyother means, a tourniquet may be required. However, inthe process of limiting further blood loss, the tourniquetalso drastically deprives the limb tissues of oxygen. As aresult, the patient may live but the limb may die.\nDressing the wound\nOnce the bleeding has been stopped, cleaning and\ndressing the wound is important for preventing infection.Although the flowing blood flushes debris from thewound, running water should also be used to rinse awaydirt. Embedded particles such as wood slivers and glasssplinters, if not too deep, may be removed with a needleor pair of tweezers that has been sterilized in rubbingalcohol or in the heat of a flame. Once the wound has\nbeen cleared of foreign material and washed, it should begently blotted dry, with care not to disturb the blood clot.An antibiotic ointment may be applied. The woundshould then be covered with a clean dressing and ban-daged to hold the dressing in place.\nGetting medical assistance\nA person who has become impaled on a fixed object,\nsuch as a fence post or a stake in the ground, should onlybe moved by emergency medical personnel. Foreign\nobjects embedded in the eye should only be removed by\na doctor. Larger penetrating objects, such as a fishhookor an arrow, should only be removed by a doctor to pre-vent further damage as they exit. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3582Wounds\nA defensive hand wound from a knife attack.

Separation of skin\nor other tissue by a tremendous force, producingirregular edges.\nPlasma —The straw-colored fluid component of\nblood, without the other blood cells.\nPuncture —An injury caused by a sharp, narrow\nobject deeply penetrating the skin.\nTourniquet —A device used to control bleeding,\nconsisting of a constricting band applied tightlyaround a limb above the wound. It should only beused if the bleeding in life-threatening and can notbe controlled by other means.\nTraumatic shock —A condition of depressed body\nfunctions as a reaction to injury with loss of bodyfluids or lack of oxygen. Signs of traumatic shockinclude weak and rapid pulse, shallow and rapidbreathing, and pale, cool, clammy skin.\nWhole blood —Blood which contains red blood\ncells, white blood cells, and platelets in plasma.Additional medical attention is necessary in sever-\nal instances. Wounds which penetrate the musclebeneath the skin should be cleaned and treated by adoctor. Such a wound may require stitches to keep itclosed during healing. Some deep wounds which donot extend to the underlying muscle may only requirebutterfly bandages to keep them closed during healing.Wounds to the face and neck, even small ones, shouldalways be examined and treated by a doctor to preservesensory function and minimize scarring. Deep woundsto the hands and wrists should be examined for nerveand tendon damage. Puncture wounds may require atetanus shot to prevent serious infection. Animal bites\nshould always be examined and the possibility ofrabies infection determined.\nInfection\nWounds which develop signs of infection should\nalso be brought to a doctor’s attention. Signs of infectionare swelling, redness, tenderness, throbbing pain, local-ized warmth, fever , swollen lymph glands, the presence\nof pus either in the wound or draining from it, and redstreaks spreading away from the wound.\nEmergency treatment\nWith even as little as one quart of blood lost, a person\nmay lose consciousness and go into traumatic shock .\nBecause this is life-threatening, emergency medical assis-tance should be called immediately. If the person stopsbreathing, artificial respiration (also called mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or rescue breathing) should be admin-istered. In the absence of a pulse, cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR ) must be performed. Once the person\nis breathing unassisted, the bleeding may be attended to. \nIn cases of severe blood loss, medical treatment may\ninclude the intravenous replacement of body fluids. Thismay be infusion with saline or plasma, or a transfusion\nof whole blood.\nAlternative treatment\nIn addition to the conventional treatments described\nabove, there are alternative therapies that may help sup-port the injured person. Homeopathy can be very effec-\ntive in acute wound situations. Ledum (Ledum palustre )\nis recommended for puncture wounds (taken internally).Calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) is the primary homeo-\npathic remedy for wounds. An antiseptic, it is used topi-cally as a succus (juice), tea, or salve. Another naturallyoccurring antiseptic is tea tree oil ( Melaleuca spp.),\nwhich can be mixed with water for cleaning wounds.Aloe ( Aloe barbadensis ) can be applied topically to\nsoothe skin during healing. When wounds affect thenerves, especially in the arms and legs, St.-John’s-wort(Hypericum perforatum ) can be helpful when taken\ninternally or applied topically. Acupuncture can help\nsupport the healing process by restoring the energy flowin the meridians that have been affected by the wound. Insome cases, vitamin E taken orally or applied topicallycan speed healing and prevent scarring.\nPrognosis\nWithout the complication of infection, most wounds\nheal well with time. Depending on the depth and size ofthe wound, it may or may not leave a visible scar.\nPrevention\nMost actions that result in wounds are preventable.\nInjuries from motor vehicle accidents may be reduced bywearing seat belts and placing children in size-appropri-ate car seats in the back seat. Sharp, jagged, or pointedobjects or machinery parts should be used according to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3583Wounds\nAbrasion Incision Laceration Puncture Avulsion Amputation\nExamples of open wounds.

Persons with XLA are vulnera-ble to repeated, potentially fatal bacterial infections.\nDescription\nXLA occurs in one in 50,000 to one in 100,000 new-\nborns. Almost all persons with the disorder are males.Although persons with XLA carry the genes to produceimmunoglobulins, a genetic defect on the X chromosomeprevents their formation. This defect is not associatedwith the immunoglobulins themselves, but rather withthe B cells in the bloodstream that ordinarily secrete theimmunoglobulins.\nB cells are a type of white blood cell. They are the\nsole producers of immunoglobulins in the body. B cellsare produced in the bone marrow and carried to thespleen, lymph nodes, and other organs as they mature.The maturation process depends on an enzyme calledBruton’s agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (Btk). IfBtk is missing or defective, the B cells cannot mature andcannot produce immunoglobulins.\nThe gene for Btk is on the X chromosome. Certain\nchanges (mutations) in this gene result in defective Btk.Since the gene is carried on the X chromosome, XLAindividuals are almost always male. Females have two Xchromosomes, which means they have two copies of theBtk gene, one of which is normal. Males have only one Xchromosome.Causes and symptoms\nXLA is caused by a defect in the gene that codes for\nBtk. This defect leads to blocked maturation of B cells,the cells that produce immunoglobulins. Because otherportions of the immune system are functional, peoplewith XLA can fight off some types of infection, such asfungal and most viral infections. Immunoglobulins, how-ever, are vital to combat bacterial infections. Infants withXLA usually do not show symptoms during the first sixmonths of life because immunoglobulins from theirmothers are circulating in their bloodstreams. As themother’s supply decreases, the baby becomes increasing-ly vulnerable to bacterial infections.\nCommon symptoms of immunoglobulin deficiency\nappear after the infant is six months old. They includefrequent ear and sinus infections, pneumonia , and gas-\ntroenteritis . Certain viruses, such as hepatitis and polio\nviruses, can also pose a threat. Children with XLA growslowly, have small tonsils and lymph nodes, and maydevelop chronic skin infections. Approximately 20% ofthese children develop arthritis, possibly as a result ofjoint infections.\nDiagnosis\nFrequent bacterial infections, a lack of mature B\ncells, and low-to-nonexistent levels of immunoglobulinspoint to a diagnosis of XLA. A sample of the infant’sblood serum can be analyzed for the presence ofimmunoglobulins by a technique called immunoelec-\ntrophoresis . To make a definitive diagnosis, the child’s\nX chromosome is analyzed for defects in the Btk gene.Similar analysis can be used for prenatal diagnosis or todetect carriers of the defective gene.\nTreatment\nTreatment of XLA consists of regular intravenous\ndoses of commercially prepared gamma globulin (soldunder the trade names Gamimune or Gammagard) toX\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3585ward off infections. Antibiotics are used to treat infec-\ntions as they occur. Children with XLA must be treatedpromptly for even minor cuts and scrapes, and taught toavoid crowds and people with active infections.\nPrognosis\nPrior to the era of gamma globulin and antibiotic\ntreatment, approximately 90% of XLA individuals diedbefore age 8. Early diagnosis and current therapy allowsmost individuals with XLA to reach adulthood and leadrelatively normal lives. Infants who develop polio or per-sistent viral infections, however, have a poorer prognosis.\nPrevention\nParents of a child with XLA should consider genetic\ncounseling if they are planning to have more children.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —A molecule that is produced by the\nimmune system in response to a protein, called anantigen, that is not recognized as belonging in thebody.\nB cell —A type of lymphocyte, or white blood cell,\nthat is a key component of the body’s immune sys-tem.

    "content": "X rays of the orbit\nDefinition\nOrbital x rays are studies of the area and structures\ncontaining the eye. The orbit is the circle of thin bonesthat houses and protects the eye, even extending behindthe eye and nearly wrapping around it. The orbit includesthe eyebrow, the bridge of the nose and the cheekbone. Xrays are a form of radiation (like light) that can penetratebody tissues.\nPurpose\nOrbital x ray, or orbital radiography, is often used to\ndetect problems resulting from injury or trauma to the eye.The exam may also detect changes to the structure of theeye, which may indicate various diseases. An ophthalmol-ogist may also order an orbital x ray if there is concern thatforeign bodies may be present in the eye that cannot bedetected with an instrument called an ophthalmoscope.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3586X rays of the orbitPrecautions\nPregnant women and women who could possibly be\npregnant should only receive orbital x rays when absolute-ly necessary. If the patient is in severe pain due to injury\nor trauma, a painkiller may be given to help ease discom-fort during positioning of the head throughout the exam.No other precautions are necessary for orbital x rays. \nDescription\nEach orbit is composed of a floor, a roof, a medial\n(in the center plane) and lateral (sides of the plane) walls.The orbital x ray involves several different views in orderfor the physician to clearly see various parts of the eyewithout obstruction. In orbital x rays, images of the unaf-fected eye may also be taken to compare its shapes andstructures to those of the affected eye. Views may includeside view (lateral), back to front (posteroanterior), baseview, views from both sides, and an image from the cen-ter to one outside edge (half-axial projection). Projec-tions of the optical canal will also be included. For all ofthese views, the patient may be seated upright or asked tolie on a table in the x ray room.\nThe orbital x ray procedure should take about 15\nminutes to complete. Following the procedure, thepatient will usually be asked to wait until the films aredeveloped to ensure they are high enough quality andthat repeat x rays are not necessary. A physician may per-form the x ray exam in his or her office, or refer thepatient to an outpatient radiology facility or hospital radi-ology department. In the case of emergency, the exammay be performed in the emergency room or a nearbyradiology area of the hospital.\nPreparation\nThere are no special dietary preparations needed\nprior to an orbital x ray. As with any radiography proce-dure, the patient should remove any jewelry or metalobjects, which may interfere with a clear image.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is required following this diagnostic\ntest.\nRisks\nRadiation exposure is low for this procedure and all\ncertified radiology facilities follow strict personnel andequipment guidelines for radiation protection. Women ofchild bearing age and children should be offered protec-tive shielding (lead aprons) to cover the genital and/orabdominal areas.KEY TERMS\nBlowout fracture —A fracture or break in the orbit\nthat is caused by sudden and violent impact to thearea.\nMalignancy —A malignancy is a tumor that is can-\ncerous and growing.\nMedial wall —The middle bone, or wall of the\neye’s orbit. It is generally thicker than the roof andfloor walls.\nOphthalmologist —A physician who specializes in\nthe workings, structures and care of the eyes.\nOphthalmoscope —An instrument routinely used\nby ophthalmologists to examine the interior of theeye. It consists of a small light, a mirror, and lensesof differing powers that magnify.\nRadiography —Examination of any part of the\nbody through the use of x rays. The process pro-duces an image of shadows and contrasts on film.\nX ray —A form of electromagnetic radiation with\nshorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays canpenetrate most structures.\nNormal results\nNormal findings will show the bones of the orbit\nintact, and will show similarity between the orbit that isbeing studied and the unaffected orbit.\nAbnormal results\nPositive findings from an orbital x ray may show\nthat there has been injury to the eye. Certains signs mayindicate some disease that is affecting the orbital struc-tures. Tiny fractures in the orbital bones can usually be\ndetected on the radiograph. The floor bone, the medialwall and the ethmoid bone, which is a spongy bone thatforms the upper part of the nasal cavity, are the most like-ly to break. In a blowout fracture (one involving theorbital floor), radiographic findings may include disrup-tion to the orbital floor, an opaque look to the sinuses onthe same side as the affected orbit (due to hemorrhage) orsigns of sinus problems from the orbital root’s interfer-ence. These indications can be seen in most typicalorbital x ray views. \nSince the physician examines both orbits side by\nside, indications of differences in size and shape of thevarious structures in the orbit may be apparent. The orbitmay be enlarged, indicating irritation from an injury or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3587X rays of the orbitforeign body. A number of growing tumors within the\neye or brain area may also cause orbital enlargement.Destruction of the walls of the orbit may indicate a near-by infection or malignancy. Changes in density of thetiny orbit bones may also be a sign of bone disease orcancer spread to bone.\nChildren’s orbits are more likely to be enlarged by a\nfast growing lesion, since their orbital bones have notfully developed.\nResources\nBOOKS\nIllustrated Guide to Diagnostic Tests.

It is common in areas wherepoverty and overcrowding interfere with good hygienepractices. The most common locations are in rural areasthroughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and in locations bor-dering the equator in the Americas. \nCauses and symptoms\nYaws is caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium (spiro-\nchete) called Treponema pertenue . This bacterium belongs\nto the same family as the bacterium that causes syphilis .\nYaws is passed among people by direct skin contact.\nIt requires some kind of a scratched or insect bitten areain order for the bacteria to actually settle in and causeinfection. An injured spot on the leg is the most commonpart of the body through which the bacteria enter. Youngchildren, who are constantly bumping themselves inplay, who wear little clothing, who do not wash theirhands often, and who may frequently put their hands intheir mouths, are particularly susceptible.\nThe first symptom of yaws occurs three to four\nweeks after acquiring the bacteria. The area where thebacteria originally entered the skin becomes a noticeablebump (papule). The papule grows larger and develops apunched-out center (ulcer), covered with a yellow crust.Lymph nodes in the area may become swollen and ten-der. This first papule may take as long as six months toheal. Secondary soft, gummy growths then appear on theface, arms and legs, and buttocks. These soft, tumor-likemasses may grow on the soles of the feet, causing thepatient to walk in an odd and characteristic fashion onthe sides of his or her feet (nicknamed “crab yaws”).More destructive tumors may then disrupt the bones ofthe face, the jaw, and the lower leg. Ulcers around thenose and on the face may be very mutilating.\nDiagnosis\nSamples taken from the first papules may be exam-\nined using a technique called dark-field microscopy. Thisoften allows the spirochetes to be identified. They mayalso be identified in fluid withdrawn from swollen lymphnodes. Various tests can also be run on blood samples todetermine if an individual is producing antibodies (spe-cial immune cells) which are specifically made inresponse to the presence of these spirochetes.\nTreatment\nA single penicillin injection in a muscle is sufficient\nto completely end the disease.\nPrognosis\nWithout treatment, yaws is a terribly disfiguring\nchronic illness. With appropriate treatment, the progres-sion of the disease can be completely halted. \nPrevention\nFor a time, the World Health Organization (WHO) was\nworking to totally eradicate yaws, just as smallpox was suc-\ncessfully eradicated. This has not occurred, however. WHOcontinues to work to identify and respond to outbreaksquickly, in an effort to at least slow the spread of yaws. \nResources\nBOOKS\nPerine, Peter L. “Endemic Treponematoses.” In Harrison’s\nPrinciples of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Yellow fever",
    "content": "Yellow fever\nDefinition\nYellow fever is a severe infectious disease, caused\nby a virus called a “flavivirus.” This flavivirus can causeoutbreaks of epidemic proportions throughout Africa andtropical America. The first written evidence of such anepidemic occurred in the Yucatan in 1648. Since thattime, much has been learned about the interesting trans-mission patterns of this devastating illness. \nDescription\nIn order to understand how yellow fever is passed,\nseveral terms need to be defined. The word “host” refersto an animal that can be infected with a particular disease.The term “vector” refers to an organism which can carry aparticular disease-causing agent (such as a virus or bacte-ria) without actually developing the disease. The vectorcan then pass the virus or bacteria on to a new host.\nMany of the common illnesses in the United States\n(including the common cold , many viral causes of diar-\nrhea , and influenza or “flu”) are spread via direct pas-\nsage of the causative virus between human beings. Yellowfever, however, cannot be passed directly from one infect-ed human being to another. Instead, the virus responsiblefor yellow fever requires an intermediate vector, a mos-quito, which carries the virus from one host to another.\nThe hosts of yellow fever include both humans and\nmonkeys. The cycle of yellow fever transmission occursas follows: an infected monkey is bitten by a tree-holeKEY TERMS\nPapule —A raised bump on the skin.\nUlcer —A punched-out, irritated pit on the skin. breeding mosquito. This mosquito acquires the virus, and\ncan pass the virus on to any number of other monkeysthat it may bite. When a human is bitten by such a mos-quito, the human may acquire the virus. In the case ofSouth American yellow fever, the infected human mayreturn to the city, where an urban mosquito ( Aedes\naegypti ) serves as a viral vector, spreading the infection\nrapidly by biting humans.\nSymptoms\nOnce a mosquito has passed the yellow fever virus\nto a human, the chance of disease developing is about 5-20%. Infection may be fought off by the host’s immunesystem, or may be so mild that it is never identified.\nIn human hosts who develop the disease yellow\nfever, there are five distinct stages through which theinfection evolves. These have been termed the periods ofincubation, invasion, remission, intoxication, and conva-lescence. \nYellow fever’s incubation period (the amount of\ntime between the introduction of the virus into the hostand the development of symptoms) is three to six days.During this time, there are generally no symptoms identi-fiable to the host.\nThe period of invasion lasts two to five days, and\nbegins with an abrupt onset of symptoms, including feverand chills, intense headache and lower backache, muscle\naches, nausea, and extreme exhaustion. The patient’stongue shows a characteristic white, furry coating in thecenter, surrounded by a swollen, reddened margin. Whilemost other infections that cause a high fever also causean increased heart rate, yellow fever results in an unusualfinding, called Faget’s sign. This is the simultaneousoccurrence of a high fever with a slowed heart rate.Throughout the period of invasion, there are still liveviruses circulating in the patient’s blood stream. There-fore, a mosquito can bite the ill patient, acquire the virus,and continue passing it on to others. \nThe next phase is called the period of remission. The\nfever falls, and symptoms decrease in severity for severalhours to several days. In some patients, this signals theend of the disease; in other patients, this proves only tobe the calm before the storm.\nThe period of intoxication represents the most\nsevere and potentially fatal phase of the illness. Duringthis time, lasting three to nine days, a type of degenera-tion of the internal organs (specifically the kidneys, liver,and heart) occurs. This fatty degeneration results in whatis considered the classic triad of yellow fever symptoms:jaundice , black vomit, and the dumping of protein into\nthe urine. Jaundice causes the whites of the patient’s eyes\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3590Yellow feverand the patient’s skin to take on a distinctive yellow\ncolor. This is due to liver damage, and the accumulationof a substance called bilirubin, which is normallyprocessed by a healthy liver. The liver damage alsoresults in a tendency toward bleeding; the patient’s vomitappears black due to the presence of blood. Protein,which is normally kept out of the urine by healthy, intactkidneys, appears in the urine due to disruption of the kid-ney’s healthy functioning.\nPatients who survive the period of intoxication enter\ninto a relatively short period of convalescence. Theyrecover with no long term effects related to the yellowfever infection. Further, infection with the yellow fevervirus results in lifelong immunity against repeated infec-tion with the virus.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of yellow fever depends on the examina-\ntion of blood by various techniques in order to demon-strate either yellow fever viral antigens (the part of thevirus that stimulates the patient’s immune system torespond) or specific antibodies (specific cells produced bythe patient’s immune system which are directed againstthe yellow fever virus). The diagnosis can be strongly sus-pected when Faget’s sign is present. When the classic triadof symptoms is noted yellow fever is strongly suspected.\nTreatment\nThere are no current anti-viral treatments available to\ncombat the yellow fever virus. The only treatment of yel-low fever involves attempts to relieve its symptoms.Fevers and pain should be relieved with acetaminophen ,\nnot aspirin or ibuprofen, both of which could increase the\nalready-present risk of bleeding. Dehydration (due to\nfluid loss both from fever and bleeding) needs to be care-fully avoided. This can be accomplished by increasingfluids. The risk of bleeding into the stomach can bedecreased through the administration of antacids and\nother medications. Hemorrhage may require blood trans-fusions. Kidney failure may require dialysis (a processthat allows the work of the kidneys in clearing the bloodof potentially toxic substances to be taken over by amachine, outside of the body).\nPrognosis\nFive to ten percent of all diagnosed cases of yellow\nfever are fatal. Jaundice occurring during a yellow feverinfection is an extremely grave predictor. Twenty to fiftypercent of these patients die of the infection. Death may\noccur due to massive bleeding (hemorrhage), often fol-lowing a lapse into a comatose state.KEY TERMS\nEpidemic —A situation in which a particular dis-\nease spreads rapidly through a population of peo-ple in a relatively short period of time.\nFaget’s sign —The simultaneous occurrence of a\nhigh fever with a slowed heart rate.\nHost—The organism (such as a monkey or human)\nin which another organism (such as a virus or bac-teria) is living.\nVector —A carrier organism (such as a fly or mos-\nquito) which serves to deliver a virus (or otheragent of infection) to a host.\nPrevention\nA very safe, very effective yellow fever vaccine\nexists. About 95% of vaccine recipients acquire long-term immunity to the yellow fever virus.

    "title": "Yersinosis",
    "content": "Yersinosis\nDefinition\nYersinosis refers to infection by a genus of bacteria\nknown as Yersinia . The two sub-types that are responsi-\nble for yersinosis are Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia\npseudotuberculosis . The diseases produced by these\norganisms are called “zoonoses,” because the bacteria ispassed to humans from animal sources.\nThe name Yersinia comes from Dr. Alexandre\nYersin, who was the first person to grow a much moredeadly type of Yersinia known as Yersinia pestis , the bac-\nteria responsible for what is now known as bubonicplague . This article, however, will deal with the more\ncommon forms of Yersinia , namely Y. enterocolitica and\nY. pseudotuberculosis .\nDescription\nYersinia are classified as gram-negative bacteria\n(bacteria that do not accept the color of a stain in a Gramstain test, which indicates the general chemical nature ofthe cell wall of the bacteria); they have a variety ofappearances, and are therefore called pleomorphic. Theybelong to Enterobacteriacae, the large group of organ-isms that inhabit the intestinal tract. There are many dif-ferent subtypes of Yersinia .\nThey are found worldwide and have been isolated\nfrom soil, fresh water, contaminated foods, and manywild and domestic animals. For reasons not entirelyclear, disease caused by these organisms occurs morefrequently in areas of northern Europe, especially Scan-dinavia. Infection, particularly in children ages onethrough four years, is quite common, though often theseinfections produce few symptoms. Studies have shownthat infection with these bacteria is almost as common asthat with Shigella or Campylobacter .\nCauses and symptoms\nAnimals are the most important sources of bacterial\ninfection for humans. Whether from pets or undercookedmeat (especially pork), these bacteria almost alwaysenter the human body through the mouth (oral transmis-sion). An incubation period of one to eleven days passesbefore signs of disease develop. Rare cases have beentransmitted by way of contaminated blood transfusions.\nYersinia produces several different types of disease.\nThe most common form is a short-lived inflammation ofthe intestine known as enterocolitis. Most often the veryend of the small intestine is involved, an area known asthe terminal ileum. The result is gastroenteritis , with\ncramping abdominal pain ,fever , and diarrhea . Diarrhea\ngenerally continues for two weeks or so, but can go onfor many months. Up to 40% of patients also experiencenausea and vomiting ; and in one-third, inflammation of\nthe intestine leads to bleeding.\nIn other patients, the same area of the intestine is\ninvolved, but instead of causing diarrhea, a syndromeresembling appendicitis occurs. In this syndrome, the\nlymph nodes surrounding the intestine are especiallyinvolved; this has lead to the term mesenteric adenitis.Although this syndrome resolves without serious conse-quences, it is often difficult to differentiate from appen-dicitis, and leads to surgery in some instances. Ultra-sound exam may be able to demonstrate a normal appen-dix and avoid surgery. Why some patients develop symp-toms of gastroenteritis, and others only inflammation,pain, and fever, is unknown.\nIn some patients, Yersinia produces infection of\nareas other than the intestinal tract. These include:\n• Inflammation of the throat (pharyngitis) and tonsillitis ;\nthis can be quite severe and even lead to death , particu-\nlarly in adults.\n• Septicemia, or infection of the blood stream, with\nspreading of infection to other organs such as bone,meninges, kidneys, and others. Individuals withdecreased immunity due to liver disease, diabetes, can-\ncer, and other diseases are at increased risk for this\ncomplication.\nDifferent parts of the body may be affected (such as\njoints, eyes, and urinary system) by changes in theimmune system caused by Yersinia infection. Arthritis,\nwhich is especially frequent in Scandinavia, occurs in upto 10% of Yersinia infections. About one week after typi-\ncal intestinal symptoms, swelling and pain in multiplejoints occurs. The knees and ankles are most ofteninvolved, and become inflamed over a period of twoweeks. In two-thirds of those affected, symptoms gradu-ally resolve over one to three months without need fortreatment. Rarely does chronic joint disease develop.\nInflammation of the heart muscle, called myocardi-\ntis, sometimes occurs together with the arthritis. In about\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3592Yersinosis15-20% of patients, the skin develops a red, raised area,\nusually located on the shins, called erythema nodosum .\nThis appears within a few weeks of the intestinal symp-toms and disappears over a month or so.\nDiagnosis\nIdentifying Yersinia as the cause of all or any of\nthese symptoms is not an easy task. It is possible to growthe organism from stool cultures, but this is difficult to dounless special methods are used.\nA change in antibody levels can also be used to\ndetermine the presence of infection. To be accurate, lev-els must be initially examined early in the illness. There-fore, it is most important for the possible diagnosis andexamination to be thought of early.\nTreatment\nSince most of the symptoms caused by Yersinia are\nself limiting, specific antibiotic treatment is generally notneeded. Patients with dehydration from gastroenteritis\nare given supportive therapy, including treatment aimedat replacing fluids.\nAntibiotics are indicated, however, for those\npatients who develop more severe infections, such asinvasion of the bloodstream (septicemia), or who developinfections at specific sites, such as bone. A variety ofantibiotics have been used, but it is not clear which pro-duces the best results.\nNo specific treatment is indicated for the joint, ocu-\nlar, skin, or urinary symptoms that result from infection.As stated, these are not due to direct invasion by the bac-teria, but are related to changes in immune reactions pro-duced by the infection. However, treatment of thoseexperiencing severe arthritic symptoms with NSAIDS(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ) or steroid\ninjection at inflamed joints is used in selected cases.\nPrognosis\nAs noted above, most of the time, Yersinia infection\nhas an excellent outlook. However, when these bacteriainvade the bloodstream or produce disease beyond thegastrointestinal tract, the outlook is less positive. Thismay be because more severe infections occur in thosewith decreased immunity. Death rate from septicemiahas been reported to be as high as 50%.\nPrevention\nSafe food handling procedures and food-preparation\npractices are by far the best means of avoiding infection.KEY TERMS\nMesenteric adenitis —Inflammation of the lymph\nnodes which serve the small intestine.

    "content": "Yoga\nDefinition\nThe term yoga comes from a Sanskrit word which\nmeans yoke or union. Traditionally, yoga is a methodjoining the individual self with the Divine, UniversalSpirit, or Cosmic Consciousness. Physical and mentalexercises are designed to help achieve this goal, alsocalled self-transcendence or enlightenment. On the phys-ical level, yoga postures, called asanas , are designed to\ntone, strengthen, and align the body. These postures areperformed to make the spine supple and healthy and topromote blood flow to all the organs, glands, and tissues,keeping all the bodily systems healthy. On the mentallevel, yoga uses breathing techniques ( pranayama ) and\nmeditation (dyana ) to quiet, clarify, and discipline the\nmind. However, experts are quick to point out that yoga\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3593Yogais not a religion, but a way of living with health and\npeace of mind as its aims.\nPurpose\nYoga has been used to alleviate problems associated\nwith high blood pressure, high cholesterol , migraine\nheadaches, asthma , shallow breathing, backaches, con-\nstipation , diabetes, menopause ,multiple sclerosis ,vari-\ncose veins ,carpal tunnel syndrome and many chronic\nillnesses. It also has been studied and approved for itsability to promote relaxation and reduce stress .\nYoga can also provide the same benefits as any well-\ndesigned exercise program, increasing general health and\nstamina, reducing stress, and improving those conditionsbrought about by sedentary lifestyles. Yoga has the addedadvantage of being a low-impact activity that uses onlygravity as resistance, which makes it an excellent physicaltherapy routine; certain yoga postures can be safely usedto strengthen and balance all parts of the body.\nMeditation has been much studied and approved for\nits benefits in reducing stress-related conditions. Thelandmark book, The Relaxation Response , by Harvard\ncardiologist Herbert Benson, showed that meditation andbreathing techniques for relaxation could have the oppo-site effect of stress, reducing blood pressure and otherindicators. Since then, much research has reiterated thebenefits of meditation for stress reduction and general\nhealth. Currently, the American Medical Association rec-ommends meditation techniques as a first step beforemedication for borderline hypertension cases.\nModern psychological studies have shown that even\nslight facial expressions can cause changes in the involun-tary nervous system; yoga utilizes the mind/body connec-tion. That is, yoga practice contains the central ideas thatphysical posture and alignment can influence a person’s\nmood and self-esteem, and also that the mind can be usedto shape and heal the body. Yoga practitioners claim thatthe strengthening of mind/body awareness can bringeventual improvements in all facets of a person’s life.\nDescription\nOrigins\nYoga originated in ancient India and is one of the\nlongest surviving philosophical systems in the world.Some scholars have estimated that yoga is as old as 5,000years; artifacts detailing yoga postures have been found inIndia from over 3000 \nB.C. Yoga masters ( yogis ) claim that\nit is a highly developed science of healthy living that hasbeen tested and perfected for all these years. Yoga was firstbrought to America in the late 1800s when SwamiVivekananda, an Indian teacher and yogi, presented a lec-ture on meditation in Chicago. Yoga slowly began gainingfollowers, and flourished during the 1960s when there wasa surge of interest in Eastern philosophy. There has sincebeen a vast exchange of yoga knowledge in America, withmany students going to India to study and many Indianexperts coming here to teach, resulting in the establish-ment of a wide variety schools. Today, yoga is thriving,and it has become easy to find teachers and practitionersthroughout America. A recent Roper poll, commissionedbyYoga Journal , found that 11 million Americans do yoga\nat least occasionally and 6 million perform it regularly.Yoga stretches are used by physical therapists and profes-sional sports teams, and the benefits of yoga are beingtouted by movie stars and Fortune 500 executives. Manyprestigious schools of medicine have studied and intro-duced yoga techniques as proven therapies for illness andstress. Some medical schools, like UCLA, even offer yogaclasses as part of their physician training program.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3594Yoga\nYoga is a system that benefits the body, mind, and spirit by teaching self-control through a series of postures and exercises\nas well as through breathing, relaxation, and meditation techniques. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Classical yoga is separated into eight limbs, each a\npart of the complete system for mental, physical and spir-itual well-being. Four of the limbs deal with mental andphysical exercises designed to bring the mind in tune withthe body. The other four deal with different stages ofmeditation. There are six major types of yoga, all with thesame goals of health and harmony but with varying tech-niques: hatha, raja, karma, bhakti, jnana, and tantra yoga.Hatha yoga is the most commonly practiced branch of\nyoga in America, and it is a highly developed system ofnearly 200 physical postures, movements and breathingtechniques designed to tune the body to its optimal health.The yoga philosophy believes the breath to be the mostimportant facet of health, as the breath is the largestsource of prana , or life force, and hatha yoga utilize-\nspranayama , which literally means the science or control\nof breathing. Hatha yoga was originally developed as asystem to make the body strong and healthy enough toenable mental awareness and spiritual enlightenment.\nThere are several different schools of hatha yoga in\nAmerica; the two most prevalent ones are Iyengar andashtanga yoga. Iyengar yoga was founded by B.K.S.Iyengar, who is widely considered as one of the greatliving innovators of yoga. Iyengar yoga puts strictemphasis on form and alignment, and uses traditionalhatha yoga techniques in new manners and sequences.Iyengar yoga can be good for physical therapy becauseit allows the use of props like straps and blocks to makeit easier for some people to get into the yoga postures.Ashtanga yoga can be a more vigorous routine, using aflowing and dance-like sequence of hatha postures togenerate body heat, which purifies the body throughsweating and deep breathing.\nThe other types of yoga show some of the remaining\nideas which permeate yoga. Raja yoga strives to bringabout mental clarity and discipline through meditation,simplicity, and non-attachment to worldly things anddesires. Karma yoga emphasizes charity, service to others,non-aggression and non-harming as means to awarenessand peace. Bhakti yoga is the path of devotion and love ofGod, or Universal Spirit. Jnana yoga is the practice anddevelopment of knowledge and wisdom. Finally, tantrayoga is the path of self-awareness through religious ritu-als, including awareness of sexuality as sacred and vital.\nA typical hatha yoga routine consists of a sequence\nof physical poses, or asanas, and the sequence isdesigned to work all parts of the body, with particularemphasis on making the spine supple and healthy andincreasing circulation. Hatha yoga asanas utilize threebasic movements: forward bends, backward bends, andtwisting motions. Each asana is named for a commonthing it resembles, like the sun salutation, cobra, locust,plough, bow, eagle, tree, and the head to knee pose, toPATANJALI\nThere is little historical information available on\nPatanjali, who is credited with developing yoga, one ofthe six systems of Hindu philosophy. Several scholarssuggest several persons may have developed yoga underthe pseudonym of Patanjali. In any case, Patanjali exist-ed around 150 \nB.C. in India. He developed yoga based\non a loose set of doctrines and practices from the Upan-ishads, themselves a set of mystical writings. The Upan-ishads are part of the Aranyakas, philosophical conceptsthat are part of the Veda, the most ancient body of litera-ture of Hinduism. Patanjali gave these combined philo-sophical and esoteric writings a common foundation inhis Yoga Sutra , a set of 196 concise aphorisms (wise say-\nings) that form the principles of yoga. He also drewupon Samkhya, the oldest classic system of Hindu phi-losophy. Patanjali’s yoga accepted Samkhya metaphysicsand the concept of a supreme soul. He established aneight-stage discipline of self-control and meditation. Theindividual sutras (verses) lay out the entire tradition ofmeditation. They also describe the moral and physicaldisciplines needed for the soul to attain absolute free-dom from the body and self.\nname a few. Each pose has steps for entering and exiting\nit, and each posture requires proper form and alignment.A pose is held for some time, depending on its level ofdifficulty and one’s strength and stamina, and the practi-tioner is also usually aware of when to inhale and exhaleat certain points in each posture, as breathing properly isanother fundamental aspect of yoga. Breathing should bedeep and through the nose. Mental concentration in eachposition is also very important, which improves aware-ness, poise and posture. During a yoga routine there isoften a position in which to perform meditation, if deeprelaxation is one of the goals of the sequence.\nYoga routines can take anywhere from 20 minutes to\ntwo or more hours, with one hour being a good timeinvestment to perform a sequence of postures and a med-itation. Some yoga routines, depending on the teacherand school, can be as strenuous as the most difficultworkout, and some routines merely stretch and align thebody while the breath and heart rate are kept slow andsteady. Yoga achieves its best results when it is practicedas a daily discipline, and yoga can be a life-long exerciseroutine, offering deeper and more challenging positionsas a practitioner becomes more adept. The basic posi-tions can increase a person’s strength, flexibility andsense of well-being almost immediately, but it can takeyears to perfect and deepen them, which is an appealingand stimulating aspect of yoga for many.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3595YogaGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3596Yoga\nLotus (half)Cobra\nTree\nTriangle\nDemonstrations of the tree, triangle, cobra, and lotus poses.The tree and triangle are good for balance and coordination.\nCobra stretches the pelvic and strengthens the back. Lotus is a meditative pose. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Yoga is usually best learned from a yoga teacher or\nphysical therapist, but yoga is simple enough that onecan learn the basics from good books on the subject,which are plentiful. Yoga classes are generally inexpen-sive, averaging around 10 dollars per class, and studentscan learn basic postures in just a few classes. ManyYMCAs, colleges, and community health organizationsoffer beginning yoga classes as well, often for nominalfees. If yoga is part of a physical therapy program, it canbe reimbursed by insurance.\nPreparations\nYoga can be performed by those of any age and con-\ndition, although not all poses should be attempted byeveryone. Yoga is also a very accessible form of exercise;all that is needed is a flat floor surface large enough tostretch out on, a mat or towel, and enough overheadspace to fully raise the arms. It is a good activity forthose who can’t go to gyms, who don’t like other formsof exercise, or have very busy schedules. Yoga should bedone on an empty stomach, and teachers recommendwaiting three or more hours after meals. Loose and com-fortable clothing should be worn.\nPrecautions\nPeople with injuries, medical conditions, or spinal\nproblems should consult a doctor before beginning yoga.Those with medical conditions should find a yoga teacherwho is familiar with their type of problem and who is will-ing to give them individual attention. Pregnant women canbenefit from yoga, but should always be guided by anexperienced teacher. Certain yoga positions should not beperformed with a fever , or during menstruation.\nBeginners should exercise care and concentration\nwhen performing yoga postures, and not try to stretch toomuch too quickly, as injury could result. Some advancedyoga postures, like the headstand and full lotus position,can be difficult and require strength, flexibility, and grad-ual preparation, so beginners should get the help of ateacher before attempting them.\nYoga is not a competive sport; it does not matter\nhow a person does in comparison with others, but howaware and disciplined one becomes with one’s own bodyand limitations. Proper form and alignment shouldalways be maintained during a stretch or posture, and thestretch or posture should be stopped when there is pain ,\ndizziness , or fatigue . The mental component of yoga is\njust as important as the physical postures. Concentrationand awareness of breath should not be neglected. Yogashould be done with an open, gentle, and non-criticalmind; when one stretches into a yoga position, it can bethought of accepting and working on one’s limits.

Whileperforming the yoga of breathing (pranayama) and medi-tation (dyana), it is best to have an experienced teacher,as these powerful techniques can cause dizziness and dis-comfort when done improperly.\nSide effects\nSome people have reported injuries by performing\nyoga postures without proper form or concentration, or byattempting difficult positions without working up to themgradually or having appropriate supervision. Beginnerssometimes report muscle soreness and fatigue after per-forming yoga, but these side effects diminish with practice.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAlthough yoga originated in a culture very different\nfrom modern America, it has been accepted and its prac-tice has spread relatively quickly. Many yogis areamazed at how rapidly yoga’s popularity has spread inAmerica, considering the legend that it was passed downsecretly by handfuls of adherents for many centuries.\nThere can still be found some resistance to yoga, for\nactive and busy Americans sometimes find it hard tobelieve that an exercise program that requires them toslow down, concentrate, and breathe deeply can be moreeffective than lifting weights or running. However, on-going research in top medical schools is showing yoga’seffectiveness for overall health and for specific problems,making it an increasingly acceptable health practice.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAnsari, Mark, and Lark, Liz.

    "title": "Zoonosis",
    "content": "Zoonosis\nDefinition\nZoonosis, also called zoonotic disease refers to dis-\neases that can be passed from animals, whether wild ordomesticated, to humans.\nDescription\nAlthough many diseases are species specific, mean-\ning that they can only occur in one animal species, manyother diseases can be spread between different animalspecies. These are infectious diseases, caused by bacte-ria, viruses, or other disease causing organisms that canlive as well in humans as in other animals.\nThere are different methods of transmission for dif-\nferent diseases. In some cases, zoonotic diseases aretransferred by direct contact with infected animals, muchas being near an infected human can cause the spread ofan infectious disease. Other diseases are spread by drink-ing water that contains the eggs of parasites. The eggsenter the water supply from the feces of infected animals.Still others are spread by eating the flesh of infected ani-mals. Tapeworms are spread this way. Other diseases arespread by insect vectors. An insect, such as a flea or tick,feeds on an infected animal, then feeds on a human. Inthe process, the insect transfer the infecting organism.Some zoonotic diseases are well known, such as rats\n(plague ), deer tick ( Lyme disease ). Others are not as\nwell known. For example, elephants may develop tuber-\nculosis , and spread it to humans.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe following is a partial list of animals and the dis-\neases that they may carry. Not all animal carriers are listed,nor are all the diseases that the various species may carry.\n• Bats are important rabies carriers, and also carry sever-\nal other viral diseases that can affect humans.\n• Cats may carry the causative organisms for plague,\nanthrax , cowpox, tapeworm, and many bacterial infec-\ntions.\n• Dogs may carry plague, tapeworm, rabies, Rocky\nMountain Spotted Fever , and Lyme disease.\n• Horses may carry anthrax, rabies, and Salmonella\ninfections.\n• Cattle may carry the organisms that cause anthrax, Euro-\npean tick-borne encephalitis , rabies, tapeworm, Salmo-\nnella infections and many bacterial and viral diseases.\n• Pigs are best known for carrying tapeworm, but may\nalso carry a large number of other infections includinganthrax, influenza , and rabies.\n• Sheep and goats may carry rabies, European tick-borne\nencephalitis, Salmonella infections, and many bacterial\nand viral diseases.\n• Rabbits may carry plague and Q-Fever.• Birds may carry Campylobacteriosis ,Chlamydia\npsittaci ,Pasteurella multocida, Histoplasma capsula-\ntum, Salmonellosis , and others.\nZoonotic diseases may be spread in different ways.\nTapeworms care often spread to humans when they eatthe infected meat of fish, cattle, and swine. Other dis-eases are transferred by insect vectors, often blood-feed-ing insects that carry the cause of the disease from oneanimal to another.Z\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3599Diagnosis\nDiagnosis of the disease is made in the usual manner,\nby identifying the infecting organism. Each disease hasestablished symptoms and tests. Identifying the carriermay be easy, or may be more difficult when the cause is afairly common infection. For example, tapeworms are usu-ally species specific. Cattle, pigs, and fish all carry differ-ent species of tapeworms, although all can be transmittedto humans who eat undercooked meat containing livetapeworm eggs. Once the tapeworm has been identified, itis easy to tell which species the tapeworm came from.\nOther zoonotic infections may be harder to identify.\nSometimes the infection is fairly common among bothhumans and animals, and it is impossible to tell. Snakesmay carry the bacteria Escherichia coli and Proteus vul-\ngaris , but since these bacteria are already common\namong humans, it would be difficult to trace infectionsback to snakes.\nBecause of increased trade between nations, and\nchanges in animal habitats, there are often new zoonoticdiseases. These may be found in animals transportedfrom one nation to another, bringing with them new dis-eases. In some cases, changes in the environment lead tochanges in the migratory habits of animal species, bring-ing new infections.\nTreatment\nTreatment is the established treatment for the specif-\nic infection.KEY TERMS\nAnthrax —A diease of wam blooded animals, par-\nticularly cattle and sheep, transmissable to humans.The disease causes severe skin and lung damage.\nBovine spongiform encephalopathy —A progres-\nsive, fatal disease of the nervous system of domesticanimals. It is transmitted by eating infected food.\nLyme disease —An acute disease which is usually\nmarked by skin rash, fever, fatigue and chills. Leftuntreated, it may cause heart and nervous systemdamage.\nQ-Fever —A disease that is marked by high fever,\nchills and muscle pain. It is seen in North Ameri-ca, Europe, and parts of Africa. It may be spreadby drinking raw milk, or by tick bites.\nZoonotic —A disease which can be sreap from\nanimals to humans.Prevention\nPrevention of zoonotic infections may take different\nforms, depending on the nature of the carrier and theinfection.\nSome zoonotic infections can be avoided by immuniz-\ning the animals that carry the disease. Pets and otherdomestic animals should have rabies vaccinations, and wildanimals are immunized with an oral vaccine that is encasedin a suitable bait. In some places, the bait is dropped by air-plane over the range of the potential rabies carrier. Whenthe animal eats the bait, they also ingest the oral vaccine,thereby protecting them from rabies, and reducing the riskof spread of the disease. This method has been used to pro-tect foxes, coyotes, and other wild animals.\nMany zoonotic diseases that are passed by eating the\nmeat of infected animals can be prevented by propercooking of the infected meat. Tapeworm infestations canbe prevented by cooking, and Salmonella infections from\nchickens and eggs can be prevented by being sure thatboth the meat and the eggs are fully cooked.\nFor other zoonotic diseases, programs are in place to\neliminate the host, or the vector that spreads the disease.Plague is prevented by elimination of the rats—a com-mon source of the infection—and of fleas that carry thedisease from rats to humans. Efforts to control bovinespongiform encephalitis, better known as Mad Cow dis-ease, have focused on the destruction of infected cattle toprevent spread of the disease.\nOther means of prevention simply rely on care. Peo-\nple living in areas where Lyme disease is common arewarned to take precautions against the bite of the deertick, which transfers the disease. These precautionsinclude not walking in tall grass, not walking barelegged, and wearing light-colored clothing so that thepresence of the dark ticks can be readily seen.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\n“CDC improves monitoring of outbreaks.” American Medical\nNews (January 24, 2000).\n“When man’s best friend isn’t.” Mother Earth News (June/July\n2000).\n“The zoonotic threat: Curbing pet-to-people infections.” Dog\nWorld (October 1999).\n“Zoonoses.” Agricultural Research (February 2000).\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Association of Zoo Keepers (AAZK).
