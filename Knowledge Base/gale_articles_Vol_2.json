    "content": "Caffeine\nDefinition\nCaffeine is a drug that stimulates the central nervous\nsystem.\nPurpose\nCaffeine makes people more alert, less drowsy, and\nimproves coordination. Combined with certain pain\nrelievers or medicines for treating migraine headache ,\ncaffeine makes those drugs work more quickly and effec-tively. Caffeine alone can also help relieve headaches.Antihistamines are sometimes combined with caffeine\nto counteract the drowsiness that those drugs cause. Caf-feine is also sometimes used to treat other conditions,including breathing problems in newborns and in youngbabies after surgery.\nDescription\nCaffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and chocolate.\nColas and some other soft drinks contain it. Caffeine alsocomes in tablet and capsule forms and can be bought withouta prescription. Over-the-counter caffeine brands include NoDoz, Overtime, Pep-Back, Quick-Pep, Caffedrine, andVivarin. Some pain relievers, medicines for migraineheadaches, and antihistamines also contain caffeine.\nRecommended dosage\nAdults and children age 12 years and over\n100–200 mg no more than every 3–4 hours. In\ntimed-release form, the dose is 200–250 mg once a day.Timed-release forms should not be taken less than sixhours before bedtime.\nChildren under 12 years\nNot recommended.\nOther considerations\nAvoid taking too much caffeine when it is being\ntaken as an over-the-counter drug. Consider how muchcaffeine is being taken in from coffee, tea, chocolate, softdrinks, and other foods that contain caffeine. Check witha pharmacist or physician to find out how much caffeineis safe to use.\nPrecautions\nCaffeine cannot replace sleep and should not be used\nregularly to stay awake as the drug can lead to more seri-ous sleep disorders , like insomnia .\nPeople who use large amounts of caffeine over long\nperiods build up a tolerance to it. When that happens,they have to use more and more caffeine to get the sameeffects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence.If the person then stops using caffeine abruptly, with-drawal symptoms may occur. These can include throb-bing headaches, fatigue , drowsiness, yawning, irritabili-\nty, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These symp-toms can go on for as long as a week if caffeine is avoid-ed. Then the symptoms usually disappear.\nIf taken too close to bedtime, caffeine can interfere\nwith sleep. Even if it does not prevent a person fromfalling asleep, it may disturb sleep during the night.\nThe notion that caffeine helps people sober up after\ndrinking too much alcohol is a myth. In fact, using caf-feine and alcohol together is not a good idea. The combi-nation can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, and vomiting.\nOlder people may be more sensitive to caffeine and\nthus more likely to have certain side effects, such as irri-tability, nervousness, anxiety , and sleep problems.C\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 625GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 625Special conditions\nCaffeine may cause problems for people with certain\nmedical conditions or who are taking certain medicines.\nALLERGIES. Anyone with allergies to foods, dyes,\npreservatives, or to the compounds aminophylline,dyphylline, oxtriphylline, theobromine, or theophyllineshould check with a physician before using caffeine.Anyone who has ever had an unusual reaction to caffeineshould also check with a physician before using it again.\nPREGNANCY. Caffeine can pass from a pregnant\nwoman’s body into the developing fetus. Although thereis no evidence that caffeine causes birth defects in peo-\nple, it does cause such effects in laboratory animals givenvery large doses (equal to human doses of 12–24 cups ofcoffee a day). In humans, evidence exists that doses ofmore than 300 mg of caffeine a day (about the amount ofcaffeine in 2–3 cups of coffee) may cause miscarriage or\nproblems with the baby’s heart rhythm. Women who takemore than 300 mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy\nare also more likely to have babies with low birthweights. Any woman who is pregnant or planning tobecome pregnant should check with her physician beforeusing caffeine.\nBREASTFEEDING. Caffeine passes into breast milk\nand can affect the nursing baby. Nursing babies whosemothers use 600 mg or more of caffeine a day may beirritable and have trouble sleeping. Women who arebreastfeeding should check with their physicians beforeusing caffeine.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Caffeine may cause\nproblems for people with these medical conditions:\n• peptic ulcer• heart arrhythmias or palpitationsKEY TERMS\nArrhythmia —Abnormal heart rhythm.\nCentral nervous system —The brain, spinal cord\nand nerves throughout the body.\nFetus —A developing baby inside the womb.\nPalpitation —Rapid, forceful, throbbing, or flutter-\ning heartbeat.\nWithdrawal symptoms —A group of physical or\nmental symptoms that may occur when a personsuddenly stops using a drug to which he or she hasbecome dependent.• heart disease or recent heart attack (within a few\nweeks)\n• high blood pressure• liver disease\n• insomnia (trouble sleeping)\n• anxiety or panic attacks• agoraphobia (fear of being in open places)• premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using caffeine with\ncertain other drugs may interfere with the effects of thedrugs or cause unwanted—and possibly serious—sideeffects.\nSide effects\nAt recommended doses, caffeine can cause restless-\nness, irritability, nervousness, shakiness, headache , light-\nheadedness, sleeplessness, nausea, vomiting, and upsetstomach. At higher than recommended doses, caffeine cancause excitement, agitation, anxiety, confusion, a sensa-tion of light flashing before the eyes, unusual sensitivity totouch, unusual sensitivity of other senses, ringing in theears, frequent urination, muscle twitches or tremors , heart\narrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, flushing, and convulsions.\nInteractions\nCertain drugs interfere with the breakdown of caf-\nfeine in the body. These include oral contraceptives that\ncontain estrogen, the antiarrhythmia drug mexiletine(Mexitil), the ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet), and thedrug disulfiram (Antabuse), used to treat alcoholism .\nCaffeine interferes with drugs that regulate heart\nrhythm, such as quinidine and propranolol (Inderal). Caf-feine may also interfere with the body’s absorption of iron.Anyone who takes iron supplements should take them atleast an hour before or two hours after using caffeine.\nSerious side effects are possible when caffeine is\ncombined with certain drugs. For example, taking caf-feine with the decongestant phenylpropanolamine canraise blood pressure. And very serious heart problemsmay occur if caffeine and monoamine oxidase\ninhibitors (MAO) are taken together. These drugs are\nused to treat Parkinson’s disease , depression, and other\npsychiatric conditions. Consult with a pharmacist orphysician about which drugs can interact with caffeine.\nBecause caffeine stimulates the nervous system,\nanyone taking other central nervous system (CNS) stim-ulants should be careful about using caffeine.\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 626CaffeineGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 626CAH seeCongenital adrenal hyperplasia\nCaisson disease seeDecompression\nsickness\nCalcaneal spurs seeHeel spurs\nCalcitonin seeBone disorder drugs\nCalcium carbonate seeAntacids"

    "title": "Calcium channel blockers",
    "content": "Calcium channel blockers\nDefinition\nCalcium channel blockers are medicines that slow\nthe movement of calcium into the cells of the heart andblood vessels. This, in turn, relaxes blood vessels,increases the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart,and reduces the heart’s workload.\nPurpose\nCalcium channel blockers are used to treat high\nblood pressure, to correct abnormal heart rhythms, and torelieve the type of chest pain called angina pectoris.\nPhysicians also prescribe calcium channel blockers totreat panic attacks and bipolar disorder (manic depres-\nsive illness) and to prevent migraine headache .\nPrecautions\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking calcium\nchannel blockers is important. The physician will checkto make certain the medicine is working as it should andwill watch for unwanted side effects. People who havehigh blood pressure often feel perfectly fine. However,they should continue to see their prescribing physicianeven when they feel well so that he can keep a closewatch on their condition. They should also continue totake their medicine even when they feel fine.\nCalcium channel blockers will not cure high blood\npressure, but will help to control the condition. To avoidthe serious health problems associated with high bloodpressure, patients may have to take this type of medica-tion for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, the blockersalone may not be enough. People with high blood pres-sure may also need to avoid certain foods and keep theirweight under control. The health care professional whois treating the condition can offer advice as to what mea-sures may be necessary. Patients being treated for highblood pressure should not change their diets without\nconsulting their physicians.Anyone taking calcium channel blockers for high\nblood pressure should not take any other prescription orover-the-counter medication without first checking withthe prescribing physician, as some of these drugs mayincrease blood pressure.\nSome people feel drowsy or less alert than usual\nwhen taking calcium channel blockers. Anyone whotakes these drugs should not drive, use machines, or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.\nPeople who normally have chest pain when they\nexercise or exert themselves may not have the pain when\nthey are taking calcium channel blockers. This could leadthem to be more active than they should be. Anyone tak-ing calcium channel blockers should therefore consultwith the prescribing physician concerning how muchexercise and activity may be considered safe.\nSome people get headaches that last for a short time\nafter taking a dose of this medication. This problem usu-ally goes away during the course of treatment. If it doesnot, or if the headaches are severe, the prescribing physi-cian should be informed.\nPatients taking certain calcium channel blockers\nmay need to check their pulse regularly, as the drugs mayslow the pulse too much. If the pulse is too slow, circula-tion problems may result. The prescribing physician canshow patients the correct way to check their pulse.\nThis type of medication may cause the gums to\nswell, bleed, or become tender. If this problem occurs, amedical physician or dentist should be consulted. To helpprevent the problem, care should be taken when brushingand flossing the teeth. Regular dental check-ups andcleanings are also recommended.\nOlder people may be unusually sensitive to the\neffects of calcium channel blockers. This may increasethe chance of side effects.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\ntaking certain other medicines may develop problems ifthey also take calcium channel blockers. Before takingthese drugs, the prescribing physician should beinformed about any of these conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had a previous unusual\nreaction to any calcium channel blocker should let his orher physician know before taking the drugs again. Thephysician should also be notified about any allergies to\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\nPREGNANCY. The effects of taking calcium channel\nblockers during pregnancy have not been studied in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 627Calcium channel blockersGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 627humans. However, in studies of laboratory animals, large\ndoses of these drugs have been reported to cause birth\ndefects ,stillbirth , poor bone growth, and other problems\nwhen taken during pregnancy. Women who are pregnantor who may become pregnant should check with theirphysicians before using these drugs.\nBREASTFEEDING. Some calcium channel blockers\npass into breast milk, but there have been no reports ofproblems in nursing babies whose mothers were takingthis type of medication. However, women who need totake this medicine and want to breastfeed their babiesshould check with their physicians.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Calcium channel\nblockers may worsen heart or blood vessel disorders.\nThe effects of calcium channel blockers may be\ngreater in people with kidney or liver disease, as theirbodies are slower to clear the drug from their systems.\nCertain calcium channel blockers may also cause\nproblems in people with a history of heart rhythm prob-lems or with depression, Parkinson’s disease , or other\ntypes of parkinsonism.\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking calcium chan-\nnel blockers with certain other drugs may affect the waythe drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.\nAs with most medications, certain side effects are\npossible and some interactions with other substancesmay occur.\nSide effects\nSide effects are not common with this medicine, but\nsome may occur. Minor discomforts, such as dizziness ,\nlightheadedness, flushing, headache , and nausea, usual-KEY TERMS\nAngina pectoris —A feeling of tightness, heavi-\nness, or pain in the chest, caused by a lack of oxy-gen in the muscular wall of the heart.\nBipolar disorder —A severe mental illness, also\nknown as manic depression, in which a personhas extreme mood swings, ranging from a highlyexcited state—sometimes with a false sense ofwell-being—to depression.\nMigraine —A throbbing headache that usually\naffects only one side of the head. Nausea, vomit-ing, increased sensitivity to light, and other symp-toms often accompany migraine.ly go away as the body adjusts to the drug and do not\nrequire medical treatment unless they persist or they arebothersome.\nIf any of the following side effects occur, the pre-\nscribing physician should be notified as soon as possible:\n• breathing problems, coughing or wheezing\n• irregular, fast, or pounding heartbeat• slow heartbeat (less than 50 beats per minute)\n• skin rash\n• swollen ankles, feet, or lower legs\nOther side effects may occur. Anyone who has\nunusual symptoms after taking calcium blockers shouldcontact the prescribing physician.\nInteractions\nCalcium channel blockers may interact with a num-\nber of other medications. When this happens, the effectsof one or both of the drugs may change or the risk of sideeffects may increase. Anyone who takes calcium channelblockers should not take any other prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicines without firstchecking with the prescribing physician. Substances thatmay interact with calcium channel blockers include:\n• Diuretics (water pills). This type of medicine may\ncause low levels of potassium in the body, which mayincrease the chance of unwanted effects from some cal-cium channel blockers.\n• Beta-blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin), propra-\nnolol (Inderal), and metoprolol (Lopressor), used totreat high blood pressure, angina, and other conditions.Also, eye drop forms of beta blockers , such as timolol\n(Timoptic), used to treat glaucoma . Taking any of these\ndrugs with calcium channel blockers may increase theeffects of both types of medicine and may cause prob-lems if either drug is stopped suddenly.\n• Digitalis heart medicines. Taking these medicines with\ncalcium channel blockers may increase the action of theheart medication.\n• Medicines used to correct irregular heart rhythms, such as\nquinidine (Quinidex), disopyramide (Norpace), and pro-cainamide (Procan, Pronestyl). The effects of these drugsmay increase if used with calcium channel blockers.\n• Anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine (Tegre-\ntol). Calcium channel drugs may increase the effects ofthese medicines.\n• Cyclosporine (Sandimmune), a medicine that suppress-\nes the immune system. Effects may increase if this drugis taken with calcium channel blockers.\n• Grapefruit juice may increase the effects of some calci-\num channel blockers.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 628Calcium channel blockersGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 628The above list does not include every drug that may\ninteract with calcium channel blockers. The prescribingphysician or pharmacist will advise as to whether com-bining calcium channel blockers with any other prescrip-tion or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medication isappropriate or not.\nDescription\nCalcium channel blockers are available only with a\nphysician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule,and injectable forms. Some commonly used calciumchannel blockers include amlopidine (Norvasc), dilti-azem (Cardizem), isradipine (DynaCirc), nifedipine(Adalat, Procardia), nicardipine (Cardene), and vera-pamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan).\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type,\nstrength, and form of calcium channel blocker and thecondition for which it is prescribed. Correct dosage isdetermined by the prescribing physician and furtherinformation can be obtained from the pharmacist.\nCalcium channel blockers should be taken as direct-\ned. Larger or more frequent doses should not be taken,nor should doses be missed. This medicine may take sev-eral weeks to noticeably lower blood pressure. Thepatient taking calcium channel blockers should keep tak-ing the medicine, to give it time to work. Once it beginsto work and symptoms improve, it should continue to betaken as prescribed.\nThis medicine should not be discontinued without\nchecking with the prescribing physician. Some condi-tions may worsen when patients stop taking calciumchannel blockers abruptly. The prescribing physician willadvise as to how to gradually taper down before stoppingthe medication completely.\nRisks\nA report from the European Cardiology Society in\n2000 found that patients taking certain calcium chan-nel blockers had a 27% greater risk of heart attack ,\nand a 26% greater risk of heart failure than patients\ntaking other high blood pressure medicines. However,there are many patients affected by conditions that stillmake calcium channel blockers the best choice forthem. The patient should discuss this issue with theprescribing physician.\nNormal results\nThe expected result of taking a calcium channel\nblocker is to either correct abnormal heart rhythms,return blood pressure to normal, or relieve chest pain.Resources\nBOOKS\nBeers, Mark H. and Robert Berkow, eds.

    "content": "Campylobacteriosis\nDefinition\nCampylobacteriosis refers to infection by the group\nof bacteria known as Campylobacter . The term comes\nfrom the Greek word meaning “curved rod” referring tothe bacteria’s curved shape. The most common diseasecaused by these organisms is diarrhea , which most often\naffects children and younger adults. Campylobacter\ninfections account for a substantial percent of food-borneillness encountered each year.\nDescription\nThere are over 15 different subtypes, all of which are\ncurved Gram-negative rods. C. jeuni is the subtype that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 629CampylobacteriosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 629most often causes gastrointestinal disease. However, some\nspecies such as C. fetus produce disease outside the intes-\ntine, particularly in those with altered immune systems,such as people with AIDS ,cancer , and liver disease.\nCampylobacter are often found in the intestine of\nanimals raised for food produce and pets. Infected ani-mals often have no symptoms. Chickens are the mostcommon source of human infection. It is estimated that1% of the general population is infected each year.\nCauses and symptoms\nImproper or incomplete food preparation is the most\ncommon way the disease is spread, with poultry account-ing for over half the cases. Untreated water and raw milkare also potential sources.\nThe incubation period after exposure is from one to\n10 days. A day or two of mild fever , muscle aches, and\nheadache occur before intestinal symptoms begin. Diar-\nrhea with or without blood and severe abdominal crampsare the major intestinal symptoms. The severity of symp-toms is variable, ranging from only mild fever to dehy-\ndration and rarely death (mainly in the very young or\nold). The disease usually lasts about one week, but per-KEY TERMS\nAntibiotic —A medication that is designed to kill or\nweaken bacteria.\nAnti-motility medications —Medications such as\nloperamide (Imodium), dephenoxylate (Lomotil), ormedications containing codeine or narcotics whichdecrease the ability of the intestine to contract. Thiscan worsen the condition of a patient with dysen-tery or colitis.\nFluoroquinolones —A relatively new group of anti-\nbiotics that have had good success in treating infec-tions with many Gram-negative bacteria. Onedrawback is that they should not be used in child-ren under 17 years of age, because of possibleeffect on bone growth.\nFood-borne illness —A disease that is transmitted by\neating or handling contaminated food.\nGram-negative —Refers to the property of many\nbacteria that causes them to not take up color withGram’s stain, a method which is used to identifybacteria. Gram-positive bacteria which take up thestain turn purple, while Gram-negative bacteria\nwhich do not take up the stain turn red.\nGuillain-Barré syndrome —Progressive and usually\nreversible paralysis or weakness of multiple musclesusually starting in the lower extremities and oftenascending to the muscles involved in respiration.The syndrome is due to inflammation and loss ofthe myelin covering of the nerve fibers, often asso-ciated with an acute infection.\nMeninges —Outer covering of the spinal cord and\nbrain. Infection is called meningitis, which can leadto damage to the brain or spinal cord and evendeath.\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) —A liquid prepa-\nration developed by the World Health Organizationthat can decrease fluid loss in persons with diar-rhea. Originally developed to be prepared withmaterials available in the home, commercial prepa-rations have recently come into use.\nStool —Passage of fecal material; a bowel move-\nment.\nsists longer in about 20% of cases. At least 10% will have\na relapse, and some patients will continue to pass thebacteria for several weeks.\nComplications\nDehydration is the most common complication.\nEspecially at the extremes of age, this should be watchedfor and treated with either Oral Rehydration Solution orintravenous fluid replacement.\nInfection may also involve areas outside the intes-\ntine. This is unusual, except for infections with C. fetus .\nC. fetus infections tend to occur in those who have dis-\neases of decreased immunity such as AIDS, cancer, etc.This subtype is particularly adapted to protect itself fromthe body’s defenses.\nAreas outside the intestine that may be involved are:\n• Nervous system involvement either by direct infection\nof the meninges (outer covering of the spinal and brain)or more commonly by producing the Guillain-Barré\nsyndrome (progressive and reversible paralysis or\nweakness of many muscles). In fact, Campylobacter\nmay be responsible for 40% of the reported cases ofthis syndrome.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 630CampylobacteriosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 630• Joint inflammation can occur weeks later (leading to an\nunusual form of arthritis).\n• Infection of vessels and heart valves is a special charac-\nteristic of C. fetus . Immunocompromised patients may\ndevelop repeated episodes of passage of bacteria intothe bloodstream from these sites of infection.\n• The gallbladder, pancreas, and bone may be affected.\nDiagnosis\nCampylobacter is only one of many causes of acute\ndiarrhea. Culture (growing the bacteria in the laboratory)of freshly obtained diarrhea fluid is the only way to becertain of the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nThe first aim of treatment is to keep up nutrition\nand avoid dehydration. Medications used to treat diar-rhea by decreasing intestinal motility, such as Lop-eramide or Diphenoxylate are also useful, but shouldonly be used with the advice of a physician. Antibiotics\nare of value, if started within three days of onset ofsymptoms. They are indicated for those with severe orpersistent symptoms. Either an erythromycin type drugor one of the fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin)\nfor five to seven days are the accepted therapies.\nPrognosis\nMost patients with Campylobacter infection rapidly\nrecover without treatment. For certain groups of patients,infection becomes chronic and requires repeated coursesof antibiotics.\nPrevention\nGood hand washing technique as well as proper\npreparation and cooking of food is the best way to pre-vent infection.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBlaser, Martin J. “Infections due to Campylobacter and Related\nSpecies.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine ,\ned.

    "content": "Cancer\nDefinition\nCancer is not just one disease, but a large group of\nalmost one hundred diseases. Its two main characteristicsare uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human bodyand the ability of these cells to migrate from the originalsite and spread to distant sites. If the spread is not con-trolled, cancer can result in death .\nDescription\nOne out of every four deaths in the United States is\nfrom cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a causeof death in the states. About 1.2 million Americans arediagnosed with cancer annually; more than 500,000 dieof cancer annually.\nCancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of\ncancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases areseen in adults, middle-aged or older. Sixty percent of allcancers are diagnosed in people who are older than 65years of age. The most common cancers are skin cancer,lung cancer, colon cancer ,breast cancer (in women),\nand prostate cancer (in men). In addition, cancer of the\nkidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, andblood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lym-phomas) are also included among the 12 major cancersthat affect most Americans.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 631CancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 631Cancer, by definition, is a disease of the genes. A\ngene is a small part of DNA, which is the master mole-cule of the cell. Genes make “proteins,” which are theultimate workhorses of the cells. It is these proteins thatallow our bodies to carry out all the many processes thatpermit us to breathe, think, move, etc.\nThroughout people’s lives, the cells in their bodies\nare growing, dividing, and replacing themselves. Manygenes produce proteins that are involved in controllingthe processes of cell growth and division. An alteration(mutation) to the DNA molecule can disrupt the genesand produce faulty proteins. This causes the cell tobecome abnormal and lose its restraints on growth. Theabnormal cell begins to divide uncontrollably and even-tually forms a new growth known as a “tumor” or neo-plasm (medical term for cancer meaning “new growth”).\nIn a healthy individual, the immune system can rec-\nognize the neoplastic cells and destroy them before theyget a chance to divide. However, some mutant cells mayescape immune detection and survive to become tumorsor cancers.\nTumors are of two types, benign or malignant. A\nbenign tumor is not considered cancer. It is slow growing,does not spread or invade surrounding tissue, and once itis removed, it doesn’t usually recur. A malignant tumor,on the other hand, is cancer. It invades surrounding tissueand spreads to other parts of the body. If the cancer cellshave spread to the surrounding tissues, then, even afterthe malignant tumor is removed, it generally recurs.\nA majority of cancers are caused by changes in the\ncell’s DNA because of damage due to the environment.Environmental factors that are responsible for causingthe initial mutation in the DNA are called carcinogens,and there are many types.\nThere are some cancers that have a genetic basis. In\nother words, an individual could inherit faulty DNA fromhis parents, which could predispose him to getting cancer.While there is scientific evidence that both factors (envi-ronmental and genetic) play a role, less than 10% of allcancers are purely hereditary. Cancers that are known tohave a hereditary link are breast cancer, colon cancer,ovarian cancer , and uterine cancer. Besides genes, cer-\ntain physiological traits could be inherited and could con-tribute to cancers. For example, inheriting fair skin makesa person more likely to develop skin cancer, but only ifthey also have prolonged exposure to intensive sunlight.\nThere are several different types of cancers:\n• Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the\nlayers of cells covering the body’s surface and lining theinternal organs and various glands). Ninety percent ofhuman cancers fall into this category. Carcinomas can besubdivided into two types: adenocarcinomas and squa-\nmous cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers thatdevelop in an organ or a gland, while squamous cell car-cinomas refer to cancers that originate in the skin.\n• Melanomas also originate in the skin, usually in the\npigment cells (melanocytes).\n• Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting tissues of the\nbody, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels.\n• Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called\nleukemias and lymphomas respectively.\n• Gliomas are cancers of the nerve tissue.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco, alco-\nhol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectiousagents, family history, occupation, environment and pol-lution.\nAccording to the estimates of the American Cancer\nSociety (ACS), approximately 40% of the cancer deathsin 1998 will be due to tobacco and excessive alcohol use.An additional one-third of the deaths will be related todiet and nutrition . Many of the one million skin cancers\nthat are expected to be diagnosed in 1998 will be due toover-exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun’s rays.\nTobacco\nEighty to ninety percent of the lung cancer cases\noccur in smokers. Smoking has also been shown to be a\ncontributory factor in cancers of upper respiratory tract,esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, and probably liver,stomach, and kidney as well. Recently, scientists havealso shown that second-hand smoke (or passive smoking)can increase one’s risk of developing cancer.\nAlcohol\nExcessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in\ncertain cancers, such as liver cancer . Alcohol, in combi-\nnation with tobacco, significantly increases the chancesthat an individual will develop mouth, pharynx, larynxand esophageal cancers.\nDiet\nThirty-five percent of all cancers are due to dietary\ncauses. Excessive intake of fat leading to obesity has\nbeen associated with cancers of the breast, colon, rectum,pancreas, prostate, gall bladder, ovaries and uterus.\nSexual and reproductive behavior\nThe human papilloma virus, which is sexually trans-\nmitted, has been shown to cause cancer of the cervix.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 632CancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 632Having too many sex partners and becoming sexually\nactive early has been shown to increase one’s chances ofcontracting this disease. In addition, it has also beenshown that women who don’t have children or have chil-dren late in life have an increased risk for both ovarianand breast cancer.\nInfectious agents\nIn the last 20 years, scientists have obtained evidence\nto show that approximately 15% of the world’s cancerdeaths can be traced to viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Themost common cancer-causing pathogens and the cancersassociated with them are shown in table form.\nFamily history\nCertain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and uter-\nine cancer recur generation after generation in some fami-lies. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer “retinoblas-\ntoma,” a type of colon cancer, and a type of breast cancerknown as “early-onset breast cancer,” have been shown tobe linked to certain genes that can be tracked within afamily. It is therefore possible that inheriting particulargenes makes a person susceptible to certain cancers.\nOccupational hazards\nThere is evidence to prove that certain occupational\nhazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths. For exam-ple, asbestos workers have an increased incidence oflung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of gettingbladder cancer is associated with dye, rubber and gas\nworkers; skin and lung cancer with smelters, gold minersand arsenic workers; leukemia with glue and varnishworkers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung,bone and bone marrow cancer with radiologists and ura-nium miners.\nEnvironment\nRadiation is believed to cause 1–2% of all cancer\ndeaths. Ultra-violet radiation from the sun accounts for amajority of melanoma deaths. Other sources of radiationare x rays, radon gas, and ionizing radiation from nuclearmaterial.\nPollution\nSeveral studies have shown that there is a well-\nestablished link between asbestos and cancer. Chlorina-tion of water may account for a small rise in cancer risk.However, the main danger from pollution occurs whendangerous chemicals from the industries escape into thesurrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1%of cancer deaths are due to air, land and water pollution.Cancer is a progressive disease, and goes through sev-\neral stages. Each stage may produce a number of symp-toms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occurdue to a tumor that is growing within an organ or a gland.As the tumor grows, it may press on the nearby nerves,organs and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pres-\nsure which may be the earliest warning signs of cancer.\nDespite the fact that there are several hundred differ-\nent types of cancers, producing very different symptoms,the ACS has established the following seven symptomsas possible warning signals of cancer:\n• changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole\n• a sore that does not heal• persistent cough , hoarseness, or sore throat\n• a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere• unusual bleeding or discharge\n• chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing\n• any change in bowel or bladder habits\nMany other diseases, besides cancer, could produce\nthe same symptoms. However, it is important to havethese symptoms checked, as soon as possible, especiallyif they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat-ed, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancerssuch as breast cancer may not have any early symptoms.Therefore, it is important to undergo routine screeningtests such as breast self-exams and mammograms.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis begins with a thorough physical examina-\ntion and a complete medical history. The doctor will\nobserve, feel and palpate (apply pressure by touch) differ-ent parts of the body in order to identify any variationsfrom the normal size, feel and texture of the organ or tissue.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 633Cancer\nFrequency Of Cancer-Related Death\nCancer Site Number of Deaths Per Year\nLung 160,100\nColon and rectum 56,500Breast 43,900Prostate 39,200Pancreas 28,900Lymphoma 26,300Leukemia 21,600Brain 17,400Stomach 13,700Liver 13,000Esophagus 11,900Bladder 12,500Kidney 11,600Multiple myeloma 11,300GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 633As part of the physical exam, the doctor will inspect\nthe oral cavity or the mouth. By focusing a light into themouth, he will look for abnormalities in color, moisture,surface texture, or presence of any thickening or sore in thelips, tongue, gums, the hard palate on the roof of the mouth,and the throat. To detect thyroid cancer , the doctor will\nobserve the front of the neck for swelling. He may gentlymanipulate the neck and palpate the front and side surfacesof the thyroid gland (located at the base of the neck) todetect any nodules or tenderness. As part of the physicalexamination, the doctor will also palpate the lymph nodesin the neck, under the arms and in the groin. Many illnessesand cancers cause a swelling of the lymph nodes.\nThe doctor may conduct a thorough examination of\nthe skin to look for sores that have been present for morethan three weeks and that bleed, ooze, or crust; irritatedpatches that may itch or hurt, and any change in the sizeof a wart or a mole.\nExamination of the female pelvis is used to detect\ncancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In thevisual examination, the doctor looks for abnormal dis-charges or the presence of sores. Then, using glovedhands the physician palpates the internal pelvic organssuch as the uterus and ovaries to detect any abnormalmasses. Breast examination includes visual observationwhere the doctor looks for any discharge, unevenness,discoloration, or scaling. The doctor palpates bothbreasts to feel for masses or lumps.\nFor males, inspection of the rectum and the prostate\nis also included in the physical examination. The doctorinserts a gloved finger into the rectum and rotates it slow-ly to feel for any growths, tumors, or other abnormalities.The doctor also conducts an examination of the testes,where the doctor observes the genital area and looks forswelling or other abnormalities. The testicles are palpat-ed to identify any lumps, thickening or differences in thesize, weight and firmness.\nIf the doctor detects an abnormality on physical exam-\nination, or the patient has some symptom that could beindicative of cancer, the doctor may order diagnostic tests.\nLaboratory studies of sputum (sputum cytology),\nblood, urine, and stool can detect abnormalities that mayindicate cancer. Sputum cytology is a test where thephlegm that is coughed up from the lungs is microscopi-cally examined. It is often used to detect lung cancer. Ablood test for cancer is easy to perform, usually inexpen-sive and risk-free. The blood sample is obtained by a labtechnician or a doctor by inserting a needle into a veinand is relatively painless. Blood tests can be either spe-cific or non-specific. Often times, in certain cancers, thecancer cells release particular proteins (called tumor\nmarkers ) and blood tests can be used to detect the pres-ence of these tumor markers. However, with a few excep-\ntions, tumor markers are not used for routine screeningof cancers, because several non-cancerous conditionsalso produce positive results. Blood tests are generallymore useful in monitoring the effectiveness of the treat-ment, or in following the course of the disease anddetecting recurrent disease.\nImaging tests such as computed tomography scans\n(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultra-\nsound and fiberoptic scope examinations help the doctorsdetermine the location of the tumor even if it is deepwithin the body. Conventional x rays are often used forinitial evaluation, because they are relatively cheap, pain-less and easily accessible. In order to increase the infor-mation obtained from a conventional x ray, air or a dye(such as barium or iodine) may be used as a contrastmedium to outline or highlight parts of the body.\nThe most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy,\nwherein a piece of tissue is surgically removed for micro-scope examination. Besides confirming a cancer, thebiopsy also provides information about the type of can-cer, the stage it has reached, the aggressiveness of thecancer and the extent of its spread. Since a biopsy pro-vides the most accurate analysis, it is considered the goldstandard of diagnostic tests.\nScreening examinations conducted regularly by\nhealthcare professionals can result in the detection of can-cers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis,tongue, mouth, and skin at early stages, when treatment ismore likely to be successful. Some of the routine screen-ing tests recommended by the ACS are sigmoidoscopy\n(for colorectal cancer), mammography (for breast can-\ncer), pap smear (for cervical cancer ), and the PSA test\n(for prostate cancer). Self-examinations for cancers of thebreast, testes, mouth, and skin can also help in detectingthe tumors before the symptoms become serious.\nA recent revolution in molecular biology and cancer\ngenetics has contributed a great deal to the developmentof several tests designed to assess one’s risk of gettingcancers. These new techniques include genetic testing ,\nwhere molecular probes are used to identify mutations incertain genes that have been linked to particular cancers.At present, however, there are a lot of limitations to genet-ic testing and its utility appears ambiguous, emphasizingthe need to develop better strategies for early detection.\nTreatment\nThe aim of cancer treatment is to remove all or as\nmuch of the tumor as possible and to prevent the recur-rence or spread of the primary tumor. While devising atreatment plan for cancer, the likelihood of curing the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 634CancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 634cancer has to be weighed against the side effects of the\ntreatment. If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure isnot possible, then the treatment should be aimed atrelieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for aslong as possible.\nCancer treatment can take many different forms, and\nit is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci-sion on which type of treatment is the most appropriatedepends on the type and location of cancer, the extent towhich it has already spread, the patient’s age, sex, gener-al health status and personal treatment preferences. Themajor types of treatment are: surgery, radiation, chemo-\ntherapy , immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone-\nmarrow transplantation.\nSurgery\nSurgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the\nmost frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec-tive when a cancer is small and confined to one area ofthe body.\nSurgery can be used for many purposes.\n• Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves\nremoval of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical-ly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area.Along with the cancer, some part of the normal sur-rounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancercells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreadsvia the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes maybe examined and sometimes they are removed as well.\n• Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery\ninvolves removal of an abnormal looking area that islikely to become malignant over time. For example,40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer-\native colitis , ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than\nlive with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo-ple may choose to have their colons removed andreduce the risk significantly.• Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag-\nnosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can beperformed by inserting a needle through the skin. How-ever, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissuesample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation.\n• Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor\nremoves as much of the cancer as possible, and thentreats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo-\ntherapy or both.\n• Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not\nthe cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large orhas spread so much that removing the entire tumor is notan option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may beso large that it may press on and block a portion of theintestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain andvomiting. “Debulking surgery” may remove a part of theblockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that aredependent on hormones, removal of the organs thatsecrete the hormones is an option. For example, inprostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi-cles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, aman may undergo an “orchiectomy” (removal of testi-cles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in atype of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries(oophorectomy ) will stop the synthesis of hormones\nfrom the ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer.\nRadiation\nRadiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone\nin cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. Moreoften, it is used in conjunction with surgery andchemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter-nal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at thetumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (alsoknown as brachytherapy), a radioactive substance in theform of pellets or liquid is placed at the cancerous siteby means of a pill, injection or insertion in a sealed con-tainer.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 635Cancer\nCommon Pathogens And The Cancers Associated With Them\nCausative Angent Type of Cancer\nViruses\nPapillomaviruses Cancer of the cervix\nHepatitis B virus Liver cancerHepatitis C virus Liver cancerEpstein-Barr virus Burkitt’s lymphomaCancers of the upper pharynx Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Gastric cancersHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Kaposi’s sarcoma lymphoma\nBacteria\nHelicobacter pylori Stomach cancer lymphomasGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 635Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells.\nIt destroys the hard-to-detect cancer cells that havespread and are circulating in the body. Chemotherapeuticdrugs can be taken either orally (by mouth) or intra-venously, and may be given alone or in conjunction withsurgery, radiation or both.\nWhen chemotherapy is used before surgery or radia-\ntion, it is known as primary chemotherapy or “neoadju-vant chemotherapy.” An advantage of neoadjuvantchemotherapy is that since the cancer cells have not beenexposed to anti-cancer drugs, they are especially vulnera-ble. It can therefore be used effectively to reduce the sizeof the tumor for surgery or target it for radiation. Howev-er, the toxic effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy aresevere. In addition, it may make the body less tolerant tothe side effects of other treatments that follow such asradiation therapy. The more common use of chemothera-py is adjuvant therapy, which is given to enhance theeffectiveness of other treatments For example, aftersurgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is given to destroy anycancerous cells that still remain in the body.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s own immune sys-\ntem to destroy cancer cells. This form of treatment isbeing intensively studied in clinical trials and is not yetwidely available to most cancer patients. The variousimmunological agents being tested include substancesproduced by the body (such as the interferons, inter-leukins, and growth factors), monoclonal antibodies andvaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines donot prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treatpeople who already have the disease. Cancer vaccineswork by boosting the body’s immune system and trainingthe immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells.\nHormone therapy\nHormone therapy is standard treatment for some\ntypes of cancers that are hormone-dependent and growfaster in the presence of particular hormones. Theseinclude cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hor-mone therapy involves blocking the production or actionof these hormones. As a result the growth of the tumorslows down and survival may be extended for severalmonths or years.\nBone marrow transplantation\nThe bone marrow is the tissue within the bone cavi-\nties that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy bonemarrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood supplyand is essential to life. Sometimes, the amount of drugs\nor radiation needed to destroy cancer cells also destroysbone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with healthycells counteracts this adverse effect. A bone marrowtransplant is the removal of marrow from one person andthe transplant of the blood-forming cells either to thesame person or to someone else. Bone-marrow trans-plantation, while not a therapy in itself, is often used to“rescue” a patient, by allowing those with cancer toundergo very aggressive therapy.\nMany different specialists generally work together\nas a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is aphysician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologistprovides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any othernon-surgical treatment that does not involve radiation.The oncologist often serves as the primary physician andcoordinates the patient’s treatment plan.\nThe radiation oncologist specializes in using radia-\ntion to treat cancer, while the surgical oncologist performsthe operations needed to diagnose or treat cancer. Gyne-cologist-oncologists and pediatric-oncologists, as theirtitles suggest, are physicians involved with treatingwomen’s and children’s cancers respectively. Many otherspecialists may also be involved in the care of a cancerpatient. For example, radiologists specialize in the use ofx rays, ultrasounds, computed tomography scans (CTscans), MRI imaging and other techniques that are used todiagnose cancer. Hematologists specialize in disorders ofthe blood and are consulted in case of blood cancers andbone marrow cancers. The samples that are removed forbiopsy are sent to a laboratory, where a pathologist exam-ines them to determine the type of cancer and extent ofthe disease. Only some of the specialists who are involvedwith cancer care have been mentioned above. There aremany other specialties, and virtually any type of medicalor surgical specialist may become involved with care ofthe cancer patient should it become necessary.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are a multitude of alternative treatments avail-\nable to help the person with cancer. They can be used inconjunction with, or separate from, surgery, chemothera-py, and radiation therapy. Alternative treatment of canceris a complicated arena and a trained health practitionershould be consulted.\nAlthough the effectiveness of complementary thera-\npies such as acupuncture in alleviating cancer pain has\nnot been clinically proven, many cancer patients find itsafe and beneficial. Bodywork therapies such as massageand reflexology ease muscle tension and may alleviate\nthe side effects such as nausea and vomiting . Home-\nopathy and herbal remedies used in Chinese traditional\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 636CancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 636herbal medicine have also been shown to alleviate some\nof the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy and arebeing recommended by many doctors.\nCertain foods including many vegetables, fruits and\ngrains are believed to offer protection against variouscancers. However, isolation of the individual constituentof vegetables and fruits that are anti-cancer agents hasproven difficult. In laboratory studies, vitamins such as\nA, C and E, as well as compounds such as isothio-cyanates and dithiolthiones found in broccoli, cauli-flower, and cabbage, and beta-carotene found in carrotshave been shown to protect against cancer. Studies haveshown that eating a diet rich in fiber as found in fruitsand vegetables reduces the risk of colon cancer. Exercise\nand a low fat diet help control weight and reduce the riskof endometrial, breast, and colon cancer.\nCertain drugs, which are currently being used for\ntreatment, could also be suitable for prevention. Forexample, the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex), which has beenvery effective against breast cancer, is currently beingtested by the National Cancer Institute for its ability toprevent cancer. Similarly, retinoids derived from vitaminA are being tested for their ability to slow the progressionor prevent head and neck cancers. Certain studies havesuggested that cancer incidence is lower in areas wheresoil and foods are rich in the mineral selenium. More tri-als are needed to explain these intriguing connections.\nPrognosis\n“Lifetime risk” is the term that cancer researchers\nuse to refer to the probability that an individual over thecourse of a lifetime will develop cancer or die from it. Inthe United States, men have a one in two lifetime risk ofdeveloping cancer, and for women the risk is one inthree. Overall, African-Americans are more likely todevelop cancer than whites. African-Americans are also30% more likely to die of cancer than whites.\nMost cancers are curable if detected and treated at\ntheir early stages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is affectedby many factors, particularly the type of cancer thepatient has, the stage of the cancer, the extent to which ithas metastasized and the aggressiveness of the cancer. Inaddition, the patient’s age, general health status and theeffectiveness of the treatment being pursued are alsoimportant factors.\nTo help predict the future course and outcome of the\ndisease and the likelihood of recovery from the disease,doctors often use statistics. The five-year survival ratesare the most common measures used. The number refersto the proportion of people with cancer who are expectedto be alive, five years after initial diagnosis, comparedwith a similar population that is free of cancer. It is\nimportant to note that while statistics can give someinformation about the average survival experience ofcancer patients in a given population, it cannot be used toindicate individual prognosis, because no two patientsare exactly alike.\nPrevention\nAccording to nutritionists and epidemiologists from\nleading universities in the United States, a person canreduce the chances of getting cancer by following somesimple guidelines:\n• eating plenty of vegetables and fruits\n• exercising vigorously for at least 20 minutes every day\n• avoiding excessive weight gain\n• avoiding tobacco (even second hand smoke)\n• decreasing or avoiding consumption of animal fats and\nred meats\n• avoiding excessive amounts of alcohol\n• avoiding the midday sun (between 11 \nA.M. and 3 P.M.)\nwhen the suns rays are the strongest\n• avoiding risky sexual practices\n• avoiding known carcinogens in the environment or\nwork place\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 637Cancer\nA transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of two spindle\ncell nuclei from a human sarcoma.

The surgeon usually identifies poten-\ntial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera-tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can becurative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid,breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers. The bestchance for a surgical cure is usually with the first opera-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 638Cancer therapy, definitiveGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 638tion. It is essential that the cancer surgeon (oncologic sur-\ngeon) be experienced in the specific procedure.\nRadiation therapy is commonly administered to\napproximately 50% of cancer patients during the course ofillness. It can be used as the sole method of cure for tumorsin the mouth and neighboring structures in the oral cavity,vagina, prostate, cervix, esophagus, Hodgkin’s disease ,\nand certain types of cancer in the spinal cord and brain.Research and clinical trials have demonstrated that combi-nation treatment is more effective than radiotherapy alone.\nChemotherapy is curative for only a small percent-\nage of cancers. It is most effective for choriocarcinoma ,\ncancer of the testis, some types of lymphomas, and can-cer of skeletal muscles.\nBiological therapies are a new and promising direc-\ntion for cancer cures. Usually when cancer cells growthey manage to derive a blood supply that allows passageof nutrients promoting continuation of abnormal cancergrowth. Research that focuses on destroying these bloodvessels is called angiogenesis. Cutting off the blood sup-ply has been shown to destroy tumors, since this stopsthe flow of essential nutrients required for cancer growth.Use of certain growth factors can also stimulate self-destructive pathways in cancer cells (apoptosis). Gene\ntherapy is directed towards inhibiting specific cellular\nsignals that promote cancer cell multiplication.\nPrecautions\nSurgical resection requires an experienced surgeon,\npreoperative assessment, imaging studies, and delicateoperative technique. Care should be taken during the pro-cedure to avoid unnecessary tumor manipulation, whichcan cause cancer cells to infiltrate adjacent structures. Ifmanipulation is excessive, cells can enter nearby areasfor future re-growth. Accurate isolation of the tumor canalso help to avoid contamination of the surgical area.Early ligation of the blood supply to the tumor is anessential component of a surgical cure.\nRadiotherapy requires extensive treatment planning\nand imaging. Care must be taken to localize the cancerfield while attempting to spare destruction of normal tis-sue. This requires image monitoring and exact position-ing during radiation treatment sessions.\nChemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal\ncells, and cancer cells can become immune to chemicaldestruction. Side effects and patient tolerance issues aretypically anticipated and dosages may have to be specifi-cally altered. Very few chemotherapeutic agents offercurative responses.\nBiological therapies may cause patient toxicity\nresulting in extensive side effects. This can occur sincethe optimal dose may be exceedingly elevated above\npatient tolerance.\nDescription\nSurgery\nSurgical removal of the tumor must be performed with\ncare and accuracy. The surgeon must avoid over manipula-tion of the surgical field. Too much movement within thearea can cause cancer cell displacement into surroundingtissue. If this occurs and no further treatment is indicated,the tumor may grow again. The surgeon should also per-form an assessment concerning tissue removal around thecancer site. Tissue around the site may not by inspectionseem cancerous, but adjacent structures may have cancercells and surrounding tissue removal is usually part of theoperative procedure. Pieces of tumor and the surroundingarea are analyzed microscopically during the operation forcell type. An adequate resection (removal of tissue) willreveal normal cells in the specimens analyzed from areasbordering the cancerous growth. Surgery can also help todecrease the tumor bulk and, along with other treatmentmeasures, may provide a cure for certain cancers.\nNot only can surgery be curative for some cancers,\nbut it is an essential diagnostic tool that must be assessedintraoperatively since microscopic analysis will guidethe surgeon concerning tumor and surrounding tissueremoval. These diagnostic procedures include an aspira-tion biopsy, which inserts a needle to extract (aspirate)fluid contained inside a cancerous growth; a needle biop-sy uses a specialized needle to obtain a core tissue speci-men; an incision biopsy removes a section from a largetumor; and an excision biopsy removes the entire tumor.The surgeon can also take samples of neighboring lymphnodes. Cancer in surrounding lymph nodes is an impor-tant avenue for distant spread of cancer to other areas. Ifmicroscopic analysis determines the presence of cancercells in lymph nodes then the surgeon may decide to per-form a more aggressive surgical approach.\nRadiation therapy\nSimilar to surgical intervention, radiotherapy is a\nlocalized treatment. It involves the administration of ion-izing radiation to a solid tumor location. This generatesreactive oxygen molecules, causing the destruction ofDNA in local cells. There are three commonly usedradiotherapy beams: gamma rays from a linear accelera-tor machine produce a focused beam; orthovoltage raysare of less energy, thus penetrate less and typically deliv-er higher doses to superficial tissues (efficient for treat-ing skin cancers); and megavoltage rays are high energyproducing beams and can penetrate deeply situated inter-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 639Cancer therapy, definitiveGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 639nal organs, while sparing extensive skin damage. Two\ncommon routes can deliver radiation. Brachytherapydelivers radiation to a local area by placing radioactivematerials within close proximity to the cancerous site.Teletherapy delivers radiation to a specific area using anexternal beam machine.\nChemotherapy\nCurative chemotherapy usually requires multiple\nadministrations of the chemical agent. Chemotherapy orsystemic therapy is administered in the blood and circu-lates through the entire body. The choice of chemothera-peutic agents depends on the specific type of cancer.Chemotherapy is more commonly used for metastatic(malignant cancer which has spread to other areasbeyond the primary site of cancer growth) disease, sincevery few cancers are cured by systemic therapy.\nBiologic therapy\nBiologic therapies primarily function to alter the\npatient’s response to cancer. These treatments are mostlyinvestigations and there are numerous research protocolsstudying the effects of biologic treatments. These proto-cols usually have strict admission criteria that mayexclude potential candidates who can benefit from treat-ment. These treatments tend to stimulate specific immunecells or immune chemicals to destroy cancer cells.\nPreparation\nFor all treatment modalities imaging studies, biopsy,\nand constant blood analysis is essential before, during,and after treatments. Surgical candidates should undergoextensive pre-operative evaluation with imaging studies,blood chemistry analysis, stabilized health status, andreadiness of staff for any potential complications and cellbiopsy analysis. Patients with other pre-existing chronicdisease may require intensive post-operative monitoring.\nFor radiotherapy, the patient undergoes extensive imag-\ning studies. Additional planning strategies include beamKEY TERMS\nBone marrow suppression —A decrease in cells\nresponsible for providing immunity, carrying oxygenand those responsible for normal blood clotting.\nDNA —The molecule responsible for cell multipli-\ncation.\nTitrate —To analyze the best end point (for dose)\nfor a medication.localization to spare normal tissues, calibration of fractionat-\ned doses, and specific positioning during treatment sessions.\nPatients who receive curative chemotherapy should\nbe informed of possible side effects associated with thechemotherapeutic agent. Patients should also be informedof temporary lifestyle changes and medications that mayoffer some symptomatic relief.\nPatients undergoing biologic therapies are usually\nadvised of potential side effects, treatment cycles andspecific tests for monitoring progress according to thespecific research protocol.\nAftercare\nPatients will typically be evaluated by imaging stud-\nies, blood analysis, physical examination , and health\nimprovement. These follow-up visits usually occur at spe-cific time intervals during the course of treatment. Surgi-cal patients may require closer observation during the ini-tial post-operative period to avoid potential complica-tions. Reconstructive surgery can be considered toimprove appearance and restore function. Certain surgicalprocedures (such as flaps and microsurgery of blood ves-sels) can restore new tissues to a previous surgery site.\nRisks\nSurgical risks\nSurgical therapy can be both disfiguring and dis-\nabling. Many normal tissues can be adversely affectedby radiotherapy. Side effects that commonly occurshortly after a treatment cycle include nausea, vomiting,fatigue , loss of appetite, and bone marrow suppression\n(a decrease in the cells that provide defense againstinfections and those which carry oxygen to cells). \nRadiation risks\nRadiotherapy can also cause difficulty swallowing,\noral gum disease, and dry mouth . Additionally, radia-\ntion therapy can cause damage to local structures withinthe irradiated field.\nChemotherapy risks\nChemotherapy commonly causes bone marrow\nsuppression. Additionally, a cell called platelets—important for normal blood clotting—may be signifi-cantly lowered, causing patients to bleed. This may beproblematic enough to limit the treatment course. Bonemarrow suppression can increase susceptibility toinfection and also cause infertility . Patients commonly\nhave bouts of nausea and vomiting shortly after a\ntreatment session.

    "content": "Cancer therapy, palliative\nDefinition\nPalliative cancer therapy is treatment specifically\ndirected to help improve the symptoms associated withterminal cancer.\nPurpose\nPalliative care is directed to improving symptoms\nassociated with incurable cancer. Care can includesurgery, radiation therapy ,chemotherapy , sympto-\nmatic treatments resulting from cancer, and side effectsof treatment. The primary objective of palliative care isto improve the quality of remaining duration of life.Treatment usually involves a combination of modalities(multimodality approach) and numerous specialists aretypically involved in the treatment planning process.Therapeutic planning usually involves meticulous coor-dination with the treatment team.\nSurgery can be utilized for palliation after careful\nevaluation and planning. The use of surgery in these casesmay reduce the tumor bulk and help improve the quality oflife by relieving pain , alleviating obstruction, or control-\nling bleeding. Radiotherapy for terminal cancer patientscan also alleviate pain, bleeding, and obstruction of neigh-boring areas. Chemotherapy may be helpful to reducetumor size and provide some reduction to metastatic dis-ease. Long-term chemotherapy patients develop drugresistance, a situation that renders chemotherapeutic treat-ments ineffective. If this occurs patients are usually givena second line medication or, if admission criteria are met,they may participate in an experimental research protocol.Palliative treatments and terminal cancer in combinationcan cause many symptoms that can become problematic.These symptoms commonly include pain, nausea, vomit-ing, difficulty in breathing, constipation , dehydration,\nagitation, and delirium . The palliative treatment-planning\ngoal focuses to reduce these symptoms.\nPrecautions\nSurgery for the purpose of tumor removal , biopsy, or\nsize reduction is associated with postoperative pain andlocal nerve damage, which may be both severe and difficultto alleviate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can alsoproduce nerve damage and severe pain. Additionally,patients with malignant cancer are susceptible to infectionslike herpes, pneumonia , urinary tract infections, and\nwound abscess , all of which can cause severe pain. Pain\nassociated with cancer and/or treatments can significantlyimpair the patient’s capabilities for performing daily tasksand hence impair quality of life. These complications maynegatively impact the patient’s psychological well being.\nDescription\nPain is one of the common symptoms associated with\ncancer. Approximately 75% of terminal cancer patientshave pain. Pain is a subjective symptom and thus it cannotbe measured using technological approaches. Pain can beassessed using numeric scales (from one to 10, one is ratedas no pain while 10 is severe) or rating specific facialexpressions associated with various levels of pain. Themajority of cancer patients experience pain as a result oftumor mass that compresses neighboring nerves, bone, orsoft tissues, or from direct nerve injury (neuropathic pain).Pain can occur from affected nerves in the ribs, muscles,and internal structures such as the abdomen (crampingtype pain associated with obstruction). Many patients alsoexperience various types of pain as a direct result of fol-low-up tests, treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemo-therapy) and diagnostic procedures (i.e., biopsy).\nPreparation\nPatients are typically informed that their diagnosis is\nterminal and treatments are directed to improve qualityof life for the remaining time and to minimize emotionalsuffering associated with pain.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 641Cancer therapy, palliativeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 641A careful history is necessary to assess duration, sever-\nity, and location of pain. A physical examination may ver-\nify the presence of pain. Imaging analysis may further con-firm the presence of potential causes of pain. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) recommends an analgesic lad-der. This treatment approach provides medication selec-tions based on previous analgesic use and severity of pain.The ladder starts with the use of non-opioid (non-mor-phine) drugs such as aspirin , acetaminophin, or non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for control of mildpain. Chronic pain must be treated with constant and con-sistently administered medication(s). The “take as needed”approach is not advised. Supplemental doses may be rec-ommended in addition to the standard dose for circum-stances that may worsen pain. Opioids (i.e., morphine andcodeine) are the medications of choice for moderate tosevere pain. Doses are adjusted to produce maximum painrelief while minimizing side effects. These medications areconveniently administered orally. Administering steroidscan help reduce nausea and vomiting . Delirium and anxi-\netymay be improved by psychoactive medications.\nAftercare\nCare for palliation is continuous and consistent for\nthe remainder of life. Patients who have less than sixmonths of life remaining may choose a hospice to stoptreatment and control pain.\nRisks\nPatients taking opioids for pain relief can develop tol-\nerance and dependence. Tolerance develops when a patientrequires increasing amounts of medication to produce painreduction. Dependence shows characteristic withdrawalsymptoms if medications are abruptly stopped. Thesesymptoms can be avoided by tapering down doses in theevent that these medications should be stopped.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAbeloff, Martin D., et al. Clinical Oncology. 2nd ed.

    "content": "Cancer therapy, supportive\nDefinition\nSupportive cancer therapy is the use of medicines to\ncounteract unwanted effects of cancer treatment.\nPurpose\nAlong with their beneficial effects, many cancer\ntreatments produce uncomfortable and sometimes harm-ful side effects. For example, cancer drugs may causenausea or vomiting. They may also destroy red or whiteblood cells, resulting in a low blood count . Fortunately,\nmany of these side effects can be relieved with othermedicines.\nDescription\nDifferent kinds of drugs are used for different pur-\nposes in supportive cancer therapy. To relieve nausea\nand vomiting , a physician may prescribe dolasetron\n(Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril) or ondansetron (Zofran).Drugs called colony stimulating factors are used to helpthe bone marrow make new white blood cells to replacethose destroyed by cancer treatment. Examples of colonystimulating factors are filgrastim (Neupogen) and sar-gramostim (Leukine). Another type of drug, epoetin(Epogen, Procrit), stimulates the bone marrow to makenew red blood cells. It is a synthetically made version ofhuman erythropoietin that is made naturally in the bodyand has the same effect on bone marrow.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 642Cancer therapy, supportiveGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 642Some physicians who treat cancer recommend that\ntheir patients use marijuana to relieve nausea and vom-\niting. This practice is controversial for several reasons.Using marijuana, even for medicinal purposes, is illegalin most states. Also, most of the evidence that marijuanaeffectively relieves nausea and vomiting comes fromreports of people who have used it, not from carefullydesigned scientific studies. An oral medication that con-tains one of the active ingredients of marijuana is avail-able with a physician’s prescription and sometimes isused to treat nausea and vomiting in patients undergoingcancer treatment. However, the drug, dronabinol (Mari-nol), takes longer to work than smoked marijuana andmay be difficult for patients with nausea and vomiting toswallow and keep down.\nIn 1997, the National Institutes of Health issued a\nreport calling for more research into medical uses ofmarijuana. The panel of experts who wrote the reportalso recommended that researchers investigate otherways of getting the active ingredients of marijuana intothe body, such as nasal sprays, skin patches and inhalers.\nPatients who want to use marijuana to relieve side\neffects of cancer treatment should talk to their physiciansand should carefully consider the benefits and risks, bothmedical and legal.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\nsupportive cancer therapy. Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-scription for the correct dosage.\nPrecautions\nDolasetron, granisetron and ondansetron\nIf severe nausea and vomiting occur after taking this\nmedicine, check with a physician.\nThe use of ondansetron after abdominal surgery may\ncover up symptoms of stomach problems.\nPeople with liver disease may be more likely to have\nside effects from ondansetron.\nColony stimulating factors\nCertain cancer drugs reduce the body’s ability to\nfight infections. Although colony stimulating factors helprestore the body’s natural defenses, the process takestime. Getting prompt treatment for infections is impor-tant, even while taking this medicine. Call the physicianat the first sign of illness or infection, such as a sore\nthroat ,fever or chills.Seeing a physician regularly while taking this medi-\ncine is important. This will give the physician a chance tomake sure the medicine is working and to check forunwanted side effects.\nPeople with certain medical conditions may have\nproblems if they take colony stimulating factors. In peo-ple who have kidney disease, liver disease, or conditionscaused by inflammation or immune system problems,colony stimulating factors may make these problemsworse. People with heart disease may be more likely tohave side effects such as water retention and heartrhythm problems when they take these drugs. And peoplewith lung disease may be more likely to have shortness\nof breath . Anyone who has any of these medical condi-\ntions should check with his or her physician before usingcolony stimulating factors.\nEpoetin\nThis medicine may cause seizures (convulsions),\nespecially in people with a history of seizures. Anyonewho takes these drugs should not drive, use machines ordo anything else that might be dangerous if they have hada seizure.\nEpoetin helps the body make new red blood cells, but\nit cannot do its job unless there is plenty of iron in thebody. The physician may recommend taking iron supple-ments or certain vitamins that help get iron into the body.\nFollow the physician’s orders to make sure the body hasenough iron for this medicine to work. Do not take ironsupplements unless they are prescribed by a physician.\nIn studies of laboratory animals, epoetin taken dur-\ning pregnancy caused birth defects , including damage\nto the bones and spine. However, the drug has not beenreported to cause problems in human babies whosemothers take it. Women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should check with their physicians forthe most up-to-date information on the safety of takingthis medicine during pregnancy.\nPeople with certain medical conditions may have\nproblems if they take this medicine. For example, thechance of side effects may be greater in people with highblood pressure, heart or blood vessel disease or a historyof blood clots. Epoetin may not work properly in peoplewho have bone problems or sickle cell anemia.\nDronabinol\nThis medicine contains sesame oil and one of the\nactive ingredients of marijuana. Anyone who has hadallergic or unusual reactions to sesame oil or marijuanaproducts should let his or her physician know before tak-ing dronabinol.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 643Cancer therapy, supportiveGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 643Because dronabinol works on the central nervous sys-\ntem, it may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugsthat slow down the central nervous system. Examples ofthese drugs are antihistamines , cold medicine, allergy\nmedicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers,some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants . Dronabinol\nmay also add to the effects of anesthetics, including thoseused for dental procedures. Anyone taking dronabinolshould not drink alcohol and should check with his or herphysician before taking any of the drugs listed above.\nThis drug makes some people feel drowsy, dizzy,\nlightheaded or “high,” with a sense of well-being.Because of these possible reactions, anyone who takesdronabinol should not drive, use machines or do anythingelse that might be dangerous until they have found outhow the drug affects them.

    "content": "Candidiasis\nDefinition\nCandidiasis is an infection caused by a species of the\nyeast Candida , usually Candida albicans . This is a com-\nmon cause of vaginal infections in women. Also, Candida\nmay cause mouth infections in people with reducedimmune function, or in patients taking certain antibiotics .\nCandida can be found in virtually all normal people but\ncauses problems in only a fraction. In recent years, howev-er, several serious categories of candidiasis have becomemore common, due to overuse of antibiotics, the rise ofAIDS , the increase in organ transplantations, and the use of\ninvasive devices (catheters, artificial joints and valves)—allof which increase a patient’s susceptibility to infection.\nDescription\nV aginal candidiasis\nOver one million women in the United States devel-\nop vaginal yeast infections each year. It is not life-threat-ening, but it can be uncomfortable and frustrating.\nOral candidiasis\nThis disorder, also known as thrush, causes white,\ncurd-like patches in the mouth or throat.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 645CandidiasisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 645Deep organ candidiasis\nAlso known as invasive candidiasis, deep organ candidi-\nasis is a serious systemic infection that can affect the esopha-gus, heart, blood, liver, spleen, kidneys, eyes, and skin. Likevaginal and oral candidiasis, it is an opportunistic diseasethat strikes when a person’s resistance is lowered, often dueto another illness. There are many diagnostic categories ofdeep organ candidiasis, depending on the tissues involved.\nCauses and symptoms\nV aginal candidiasis\nMost women with vaginal candidiasis experience\nsevere vaginal itching . They also have a discharge that\noften looks like cottage cheese and has a sweet or bread-like odor. The vulva and vagina can be red, swollen, andpainful. Sexual intercourse can also be painful.\nOral candidiasis\nWhitish patches can appear on the tongue, inside of\nthe cheeks, or the palate. Oral candidiasis typicallyoccurs in people with abnormal immune systems. Thesecan include people undergoing chemotherapy for can-\ncer, people taking immunosuppressive drugs to protect\ntransplanted organs, or people with HIV infection.\nDeep organ candidiasis\nAnything that weakens the body’s natural barrier\nagainst colonizing organisms—including stomachsurgery, burns , nasogastric tubes, and catheters—can\npredispose a person for deep organ candidiasis. Risingnumbers of AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients,and other individuals whose immune systems are com-promised help account for the dramatic increase in deeporgan candidiasis in recent years. Patients with granulo-cytopenia (deficiency of white blood cells) are particular-ly at risk for deep organ candidiasis.\nDiagnosis\nOften clinical appearance gives a strong suggestion\nabout the diagnosis. Generally, a clinician will take asample of the vaginal discharge or swab an area of oralplaque, and then inspect this material under a micro-scope. Under the microscope, it is possible to see charac-teristic forms of yeasts at various stages in the lifecycle.\nFungal blood cultures should be taken for patients\nsuspected of having deep organ candidiasis. Tissue biop-sy may be needed for a definitive diagnosis.\nTreatment\nV aginal candidiasis\nIn most cases, vaginal candidiasis can be treated\nsuccessfully with a variety of over-the-counter antifungalcreams or suppositories. These include Monistat, Gyne-Lotrimin, and Mycelex. However, infections often recur.If a women has frequent recurrences, she should consulther doctor about prescription drugs such as Vagistat-1,Diflucan, and others.\nOral candidiasis\nThis is usually treated with prescription lozenges or\nmouthwashes. Some of the most-used prescriptions arenystatin mouthwashes (Nilstat or Nitrostat) and clotrima-zole lozenges.\nDeep organ candidiasis\nThe recent increase in deep organ candidiasis has led\nto the creation of treatment guidelines, including, but notlimited to, the following: Catheters should be removedfrom patients in whom these devices are still present.Antifungal chemotherapy should be started to prevent thespread of the disease. Drugs should be prescribed basedon a patient’s specific history and defense status.\nAlternative treatment\nHome remedies for vaginal candidiasis include vine-\ngar douches or insertion of a paste made from Lacto-\nbacillus acidophilus powder into the vagina. In theory,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 646Candidiasis\nThis patient’s tongue is infected with candidiasis. (Photo-\ngraph by Edward H. Gill, Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Fresh\ngarlic ( Allium sativum ) is believed to have antifungal\naction, so incorporating it into the diet or inserting agauze-wrapped, peeled garlic clove into the vagina maybe helpful. The insert should be changed twice daily.Some women report success with these remedies; theyshould try a conventional treatment if an alternative rem-edy isn’t effective.\nPrognosis\nV aginal candidiasis\nAlthough most cases of vaginal candidiasis are\ncured reliably, these infections can recur. To limit recur-rences, women may need to take a prescription anti-fun-gal drug such as terconazole (sold as Terazol) or takeother anti-fungal drugs on a preventive basis.\nOral candidiasis\nThese infections can also recur, sometimes because the\ninfecting Candida develops resistance to one drug. There-\nfore, a physician may need to prescribe a different drug.\nDeep organ candidiasis\nThe prognosis depends on the category of disease as\nwell as on the condition of the patient when the infectionstrikes. Patients who are already suffering from a seriousunderlying disease are more susceptible to deep organcandidiasis that speads throughout the body.\nPrevention\nBecause Candida is part of the normal group of\nmicroorganisms that co-exist with all people, it is impos-sible to avoid contact with it. Good vaginal hygiene and\ngood oral hygiene might reduce problems, but they are\nnot guarantees against candidiasis.\nBecause hospital-acquired (nosocomial) deep organ\ncandidiasis is on the rise, people need to be made awareof it. Patients should be sure that catheters are properlymaintained and used for the shortest possible timelength. The frequency, length, and scope of courses ofantibiotic treatment should also be cut back.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarlson, K. J., S. A. Eisenstat, and T. Ziporyn. The Harvard\nGuide to Women’s Health.

Canker sores appear as awhitish, round area with a red border. The sores arepainful and sensitive to touch. The average canker sore isabout one-quarter inch in size, although they can occa-sionally be larger. Canker sores are not infectious.\nApproximately 20% of the U.S. population is affect-\ned with recurring canker sores, and more women thanmen get them. Women are more likely to have cankersores during their premenstrual period.\nCanker sores are sometimes confused with cold\nsores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus.This disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters,\ncan occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, her-pes infection occurs on the outside of the lips and thegums, and much less frequently on the inside the mouth.Cold sores are infectious.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, howev-\ner, they seem to be related to a localized immune reac-tion. Other proposed causes for this disease are trauma tothe affected areas from toothbrush scrapes, stress , hor-\nmones, and food allergies . Canker sores tend to appear\nin response to stress. The initial symptom is a tingling ormildly painful itching sensation in the area where the\nsore will appear. After one to several days, a small redswelling appears. The sore is round, and is a whitishcolor with a grayish colored center. Usually, there is a redring of inflammation surrounding the sore. The mainsymptom is pain . Canker sores can be very painful, espe-\ncially if they are touched repeatedly, e.g., by the tongue.They last for one to two weeks.KEY TERMS\nInflammation —A local reaction to tissue injury or\ndamage, usually characterized by pain, swelling,and redness.\nSore—A wound, lesion, or ulcer on the skin.\nUlcer —A site of damage to the skin or mucous\nmembrane that is characterized by the formationof pus, death of tissue, and is frequently accompa-nied by an inflammatory reaction.Diagnosis\nCanker sores are diagnosed by observation of the\nblister. A distinction between canker sores and cold soresmust be made because cold sores are infectious and theherpes infection can be transmitted to other people. Thetwo sores can usually be distinguished visually and thereare specific diagnostic tests for herpes infection.\nTreatment\nSince canker sores heal by themselves, treatment is\nnot usually necessary. Pain relief remedies, such as topi-cal anesthetics, may be used to reduce the pain of thesores. The use of corticosteroid ointments sometimesspeeds healing. Avoidance of spicy or acidic foods canhelp reduce the pain associated with canker sores.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative therapies for canker sores are aimed at\nhealing existing sores and preventing their recurrence.Several herbal remedies, including calendula ( Calendula\nofficinalis ), myrrh ( Commiphora molmol ), and gold-\nenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), may be helpful in the\ntreatment of existing sores. Compresses soaked in teasmade from these herbs are applied directly to the sores.The tannic acid in a tea bag can also help dry up the soreswhen the wet tea bag is used as a compress. Taking dan-delion ( Taraxacum officinale ) tea or capsules may help\nheal sores and also prevent future outbreaks.

Lactose intolerance , the\ninability to digest the sugar found in milk, is widespreadand affects up to 70% of the world’s adult population.\nDescription\nCarbohydrates are the primary source of energy and,\nalong with fats and proteins, one of the three major nutri-ents in the human diet. Carbohydrates are classifiedaccording to their structure based on the number of basicsugar, or saccharide units they contain.\nA monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and\ncalled a simple sugar. Simple sugars include glucose (theform in which sugar circulates in the blood), fructose(found in fruit and honey), and galactose (produced bythe digestion of milk). These simple sugars are importantbecause they can be absorbed by the small intestine. Twosimple sugars linked together make a disaccharide. Thedisaccharide sugars present in the diet are maltose (aproduct of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar),and lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides mustbe broken down by enzymes into two simple sugars sothat they can be absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccha-rides are much more complex carbohydrates made up ofmany simple sugars, the most important of which areglycogen, which is stored in the liver, and starch.\nDigestion of sugars\nDigestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on to\nthe stomach, and then into the small intestine. Along theway, specific enzymes are needed to process differenttypes of sugars. An enzyme is a substance that acts as acatalyst to produce chemical changes without beingchanged itself. The enzymes lactase, maltase, and isoma-ltase (or sucrase) are needed to break down the disaccha-rides; when one or more is inadequate, the result is car-bohydrate intolerance.\nTypes of intolerance\nCarbohydrate intolerance can be primary or sec-\nondary. Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme defectpresent at birth or developed over time. The most commonis lactose intolerance. Secondary deficiencies are causedby a disease or disorder of the intestinal tract, and disap-pear when the disease is treated. These include proteindeficiency, celiac disease , and some intestinal infections.\nAdult lactose intolerance is the most common of all\nenzyme deficiencies, and it is estimated that 30–50 mil-lion Americans have this condition. Some racial and eth-nic populations are affected more than others. Lactoseintolerance is found in as many as 75% of African Ameri-cans, Jewish Americans, Mexican Americans, and NativeAmericans, and in 90% of Asian Americans. Descendantsof Northern Europeans and some Mediterranean peoplesusually do not develop the condition. Deficiencies inenzymes other than lactase are extremely rare.\nCauses and symptoms\nEnzymes play an important role in breaking down\ncarbohydrates into forms that can pass through the intes-tine and be used by the body. Usually they are named byadding aseto the name of the substance they act on, so\nlactase is the enzyme needed to process lactose. Cookedstarch is broken down in the mouth to a disaccharide byamylase, an enzyme in the saliva. The disaccharides mal-tose, sucrose, and lactose cannot be absorbed until theyhave been separated into simple sugar molecules by theircorresponding enzymes present in the cells lining theintestinal tract. If this process is not completed, digestionis interrupted.\nAlthough not common, a deficiency in the enzymes\nneeded to digest lactose, maltose, and sucrose is some-times present at birth. Intestinal lactase enzymes usuallydecrease naturally with age, but this happens to varyingdegrees. Because of the uneven distribution of enzymedeficiency based on race and ethnic heritage, especiallyin lactose intolerance, genetics are believed to play a rolein the cause of primary carbohydrate intolerance.\nDigestive diseases such as celiac disease and tropi-\ncal sprue (which affect absorption in the intestine), aswell as intestinal infections and injuries, can reduce theamount of enzymes produced. In cancer patients, treat-\nment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy may\naffect the cells in the intestine that normally secrete lac-tase, leading to intolerance.\nThe severity of the symptoms depends on the extent\nof the enzyme deficiency, and range from a feeling ofmild bloating to severe diarrhea . In the case of a lactase\ndeficiency, undigested milk sugar remains in the intes-tine, which is then fermented by the bacteria normallypresent in the intestine. These bacteria produce gas,cramping, bloating, a “gurgly” feeling in the abdomen,and flatulence. In a growing child, the main symptomsare diarrhea and a failure to gain weight. In an individualwith lactase deficiency, gastrointestinal distress begins\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 649Carbohydrate intoleranceGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 649about 30 minutes to two hours after eating or drinking\nfoods containing lactose. Food intolerances can be con-fused with food allergies , since the symptoms of nausea,\ncramps, bloating, and diarrhea are similar.\nSugars that aren’t broken down into one of the sim-\nplest forms cause the body to push fluid into the intestines,which results in watery diarrhea (osmotic diarrhea). Diar-rhea may sweep other nutrients out of the intestine beforethey can be absorbed, causing malnutrition .\nDiagnosis\nCarbohydrate intolerance can be diagnosed using\noral tolerance tests. The carbohydrate being investigatedis given by mouth in liquid form and several blood levelsare measured and compared to normal values. This helpsevaluate the individual’s ability to digest the sugar.\nTo identify lactose intolerance in children and\nadults, the hydrogen breath test is used to measure theamount of hydrogen in the breath. The patient drinks abeverage containing lactose and the breath is analyzedat regular intervals. If undigested lactose in the largeintestine (colon) is fermented by bacteria, various gasesare produced. Hydrogen is absorbed from the intestinesKEY TERMS\nCeliac disease —A disease, occurring in both chil-\ndren and adults, which is caused by a sensitivity togluten, a protein found in grains. It results inchronic inflammation and shrinkage of the liningof the small intestine.\nDigestion —The mechanical, chemical, and enzy-\nmatic process in which food is converted into thematerials suitable for use by the body.\nEnzyme —A substance produced by the body to\nassist in a chemical reaction. In carbohydrateintolerance, lack of an enzyme makes it impossi-ble for one type of sugar to be broken down into asimpler form so that it can be absorbed by theintestines and used by the body.\nMetabolism —All the physical and chemical\nchanges that take place within an organism.\nNutrient —Food or another substance that supplies\nthe body with the elements needed for metabolism.\nSugars —Those carbohydrates having the general\ncomposition of one part carbon, two parts hydro-gen, and one part oxygen.and carried by the bloodstream into the lungs where it\nis exhaled. Normally there is very little hydrogendetectable in the breath, so its presence indicates faultydigestion of lactose.\nWhen lactose intolerance is suspected in infants and\nyoung children, many pediatricians recommend simplychanging from cow’s milk to soy formula and watchingfor improvement. If needed, a stool sample can be testedfor acidity. The inadequate digestion of lactose will resultin an increase of acid in the waste matter excreted by thebowels and the presence of glucose.\nTreatment\nCarbohydrate intolerance caused by temporary\nintestinal diseases disappears when the condition is suc-cessfully treated. In primary conditions, no treatmentexists to improve the body’s ability to produce theenzymes, but symptoms can be controlled by diet.\nBecause the degree of lactose intolerance varies so\nmuch, treatment should be tailored for the individual.Young children showing signs of intolerance shouldavoid milk products; infants should switch to soy-basedformula. Older children and adults can adjust their intakeof lactose depending on how much and what they cantolerate. For some, a small glass of milk will not causeproblems, while others may be able to handle ice creamor aged cheeses such as cheddar or Swiss, but not otherdairy products. Generally, small amounts of lactose-con-taining foods taken throughout the day are better tolerat-ed than a large amount consumed all at once.\nFor those individuals who are sensitive to even very\nsmall amounts of lactose, the lactase enzyme is availablewithout a prescription. It comes in liquid form for usewith milk. The addition of a few drops to a quart of milkwill reduce the lactose content by 70% after 24 hours inthe refrigerator. Heating the milk speeds up the process,and doubling the amount of lactase liquid will result inmilk that is 90% lactose free. Chewable lactase enzymetablets are also available. Three to six tablets takenbefore a meal or snack will aid in the digestion of solidfoods. Lactose-reduced milk and other products are alsoavailable in stores. The milk contains the same nutrientsas regular milk.\nBecause dairy products are an important source of\ncalcium, people who reduce or severely limit their intakeof dairy products may need to consider other ways toconsume an adequate amount of calcium in their diets .\nPrognosis\nWith good dietary management, individuals with\ncarbohydrate intolerance can lead normal lives.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 650Carbohydrate intoleranceGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 650Prevention\nSince the cause of the enzyme deficiency leading to\ncarbohydrate intolerance is unknown, there is no way toprevent this condition.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMacdonald, Ian. “Carbohydrates.” In Modern Nutrition in\nHealth and Disease , ed.

    "title": "Carbon monoxide poisoning",
    "content": "Carbon monoxide poisoning\nDefinition\nCarbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs when car-\nbon monoxide gas is inhaled. CO is a colorless, odorless,highly poisonous gas that is produced by incompletecombustion. It is found in automobile exhaust fumes,faulty stoves and heating systems, fires, and cigarettesmoke. Other sources include woodburning stoves,kerosene heaters, improperly ventilated water heatersand gas stoves, and blocked or poorly maintained chim-ney flues. CO interferes with the ability of the blood tocarry oxygen. The result is headache , nausea, convul-\nsions, and finally death by asphyxiation.\nDescription\nCarbon monoxide, sometimes called coal gas, has\nbeen known as a toxic substance since the third century\nB.C. It was used for executions and suicides in early Rome.\nToday it is the leading cause of accidental poisoning in theUnited States. According to the Journal of the American\nMedical Association , 1,500 Americans die each year from\naccidental exposure to CO, and another 2,300 from inten-tional exposure (suicide). An additional 10,000 peopleseek medical attention after exposure to CO and recover.Anyone who is exposed to CO will become sick, and\nthe entire body is involved in CO poisoning. A develop-ing fetus can also be poisoned if a pregnant womanbreathes CO gas. Infants, people with heart or lung dis-ease, or those with anemia may be more seriously affect-ed. People such as underground parking garage atten-dants who are exposed to car exhausts in a confined areaare more likely to be poisoned by CO. Firemen also run ahigher risk of inhaling CO.\nCauses and symptoms\nNormally when a person breathes fresh air into the\nlungs, the oxygen in the air binds with a molecule calledhemoglobin (Hb) that is found in red blood cells. Thisallows oxygen to be moved from the lungs to every partof the body. When the oxygen/hemoglobin complexreaches a muscle where it is needed, the oxygen isreleased. Because the oxygen binding process isreversible, hemoglobin can be used over and over againto pick up oxygen and move it throughout the body.\nInhaling carbon monoxide gas interferes with this\noxygen transport system. In the lungs, CO competes withoxygen to bind with the hemoglobin molecule. Hemo-globin prefers CO to oxygen and accepts it more than200 times more readily than it accepts oxygen. Not onlydoes the hemoglobin prefer CO, it holds on to the COmuch more tightly, forming a complex called carboxyhe-moglobin (COHb). As a person breathes CO contaminat-ed air, more and more oxygen transportation sites on thehemoglobin molecules become blocked by CO. Gradual-ly, there are fewer and fewer sites available for oxygen.All cells need oxygen to live. When they don’t getenough oxygen, cellular metabolism is disrupted andeventually cells begin to die.\nThe symptoms of CO poisoning and the speed with\nwhich they appear depend on the concentration of CO inthe air and the rate and efficiency with which a personbreathes. Heavy smokers can start off with up to 9% oftheir hemoglobin already bound to CO, which they regu-larly inhale in cigarette smoke. This makes them muchmore susceptible to environmental CO. The Occupation-al Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has estab-lished a maximum permissible exposure level of 50 partsper million (ppm) over eight hours.\nWith exposure to 200 ppm for two to three hours, a\nperson begins to experience headache, fatigue , nausea,\nand dizziness . These symptoms correspond to 15–25%\nCOHb in the blood. When the concentration of COHbreaches 50% or more, death results in a very short time.Emergency room physicians have the most experiencediagnosing and treating CO poisoning.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 651Carbon monoxide poisoningGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 651The symptoms of CO poisoning in order of increas-\ning severity include:\n• headache\n• shortness of breath\n• dizziness\n• fatigue• mental confusion and difficulty thinking\n• loss of fine hand-eye coordination\n• nausea and vomiting• rapid heart rate\n• hallucinations\n• inability to execute voluntary movements accurately• collapse\n• lowered body temperature ( hypothermia )\n• coma• convulsions• seriously low blood pressure\n• cardiac and respiratory failure\n• death\nIn some cases, the skin, mucous membranes, and\nnails of a person with CO poisoning are cherry red orbright pink. Because the color change doesn’t alwaysoccur, it is an unreliable symptom to rely on for diagnosis.\nAlthough most CO poisoning is acute, or sudden, it is\npossible to suffer from chronic CO poisoning. This condi-tion exists when a person is exposed to low levels of the gasover a period of days to months. Symptoms are often vagueand include (in order of frequency) fatigue, headache,dizziness, sleep disturbances, cardiac symptoms, apathy,nausea, and memory disturbances. Little is known aboutchronic CO poisoning, and it is often misdiagnosed.KEY TERMS\nCarboxyhemoglobin (COHb) —Hemoglobin that\nis bound to carbon monoxide instead of oxygen.\nHemoglobin (Hb) —A molecule that normally\nbinds to oxygen in order to carry it to our cells,where it is required for life.\nHypothermia —Development of a subnormal body\ntemperature.\npH—A measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of\na fluid. A neutral fluid, neither acid nor alkali, hasa pH of 7.Diagnosis\nThe main reason to suspect CO poisoning is evidence\nthat fuel is being burned in a confined area, for example acar running inside a closed garage, a charcoal grill burn-ing indoors, or an unvented kerosene heater in a work-shop. Under these circumstances, one or more personssuffering from the symptoms listed above strongly sug-gests CO poisoning. In the absence of some concrete rea-son to suspect CO poisoning, the disorder is often misdi-agnosed as migraine headache ,stroke , psychiatric ill-\nness, food poisoning , alcohol poisoning, or heart disease.\nConcrete confirmation of CO poisoning comes from\na carboxyhemoglobin test. This blood test measures theamount of CO that is bound to hemoglobin in the body.Blood is drawn as soon after suspected exposure to COas possible.\nOther tests that are useful in determining the extent\nof CO poisoning include measurement of other arterialblood gases and pH; a complete blood count ; measure-\nment of other blood components such as sodium, potassi-um, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, and lactic acid; an elec-trocardiogram (ECG); and a chest x ray .\nTreatment\nImmediate treatment for CO poisoning is to remove\nthe victim from the source of carbon monoxide gas andget him or her into fresh air. If the victim is not breathingand has no pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR ) should be started. Depending on the severity of\nthe poisoning, 100% oxygen may be given with a tightfitting mask as soon as it is available.\nTaken with other symptoms of CO poisoning, COHb\nlevels of over 25% in healthy individuals, over 15% inpatients with a history of heart or lung disease, and over10% in pregnant women usually indicate the need forhospitalization. In the hospital, fluids and electrolytes aregiven to correct any imbalances that have arisen from thebreakdown of cellular metabolism.\nIn severe cases of CO poisoning, patients are given\nhyperbaric oxygen therapy. This treatment involves plac-ing the patient in a chamber breathing 100% oxygen at apressure of more than one atmosphere (the normal pres-sure the atmosphere exerts at sea level). The increasedpressure forces more oxygen into the blood. Hyperbaricfacilities are specialized, and are usually available only atlarger hospitals.\nPrognosis\nThe speed and degree of recovery from CO poison-\ning depends on the length and duration of exposure to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 652Carbon monoxide poisoningGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 652the gas. The half-life of CO in normal room air is four to\nfive hours. This means that, in four to five hours, half ofthe CO bound to hemoglobin will be replaced with oxy-gen. At normal atmospheric pressures, but breathing100% oxygen, the half-life for the elimination of COfrom the body is 50-70 minutes. In hyperbaric therapy atthree atmospheres of pressure, the half-life is reduced to20-25 minutes.\nAlthough the symptoms of CO poisoning may sub-\nside in a few hours, some patients show memory prob-lems, fatigue, confusion, and mood changes for two tofour weeks after their exposure to the gas.\nPrevention\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is preventable. Particu-\nlar care should be paid to situations where fuel is burnedin a confined area. Portable and permanently installedcarbon monoxide detectors that sound a warning similarto smoke detectors are available for under $50. Specificactions that will prevent CO poisoning include:\n• stop smoking . Smokers have less tolerance to environ-\nmental CO\n• have heating systems and appliances installed by a\nqualified contractor to assure that they are properlyvented and meet local building codes\n• inspect and properly maintain heating systems, chim-\nneys, and appliances\n• do not use a gas oven or stove to heat the home\n• do not burn charcoal indoors\n• make sure there is good ventilation if using a kerosene\nheater indoors\n• do not leave cars or trucks running inside the garage\n• keep car windows rolled up when stuck in heavy traffic,\nespecially if inside a tunnel\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Lung Association. 1740 Broadway, New York, NY\n10019.

    "content": "Carbunculosis seeBoilsCarcinoembryonic antigen test\nDefinition\nThe carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test is a labo-\nratory blood study. CEA is a substance which is normallyfound only during fetal development, but may reappearin adults who develop certain types of cancer .\nPurpose\nThe CEA test is ordered for patients with known\ncancers. The CEA test is most commonly ordered when apatient has a cancer of the gastrointestinal system. Theseinclude cancer of the colon, rectum, stomach (gastriccancer), esophagus, liver, or pancreas. It is also used withcancers of the breast, lung, or prostate.\nThe CEA level in the blood is one of the factors that\ndoctors consider when determining the prognosis, ormost likely outcome of a cancer. In general, a higherCEA level predicts a more severe disease, one that is lesslikely to be curable. But it does not give clear-cut infor-mation. The results of a CEA test are usually consideredalong with other laboratory and/or imaging studies to fol-low the course of the disease.\nOnce treatment for the cancer has begun, CEA tests\nhave a valuable role in monitoring the patient’s progress.A decreasing CEA level means therapy is effective infighting the cancer. A stable or increasing CEA level maymean the treatment is not working, and/or that the tumoris growing. It is important to understand that serial CEAmeasurements, which means several done over a periodof time, are the most useful. A single test result is diffi-cult to evaluate, but a number of tests, done weeks apart,shows trends in disease progression or regression.\nCertain types of cancer treatments, such as hormone\ntherapy for breast cancer , may actually cause the CEA\nlevel to go up. This elevation does not accurately reflectthe state of the disease. It is sometimes referred to as a“flare response.” Recognition that a rise in CEA may betemporary and due to therapy is significant. If this possi-bility is not taken into account, the patient may be unnec-essarily discouraged. Further, treatment that is actuallyeffective may be stopped or changed prematurely.\nCEA tests are also used to help detect recurrence of a\ncancer after surgery and/or other treatment has been com-pleted. A rising CEA level may be the first sign of cancerreturn, and may show up months before other studies orpatient symptoms would raise concern. Unfortunately, thisdoes not always mean the recurrent cancer can be cured.For example, only a small percentage of patients with col-orectal cancers and rising CEA levels will benefit from\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 653Carcinoembryonic antigen testGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 653another surgical exploration. Those with recurrence in the\nsame area as the original cancer, or with a single metastat-ic tumor in the liver or lung, have a chance that surgerywill eliminate the disease. Patients with more widespreadreturn of the cancer are generally not treatable withsurgery. The CEA test will not separate the two groups.\nPatients who are most likely to benefit from non-\nstandard treatments, such as bone marrow transplants,may be determined on the basis of CEA values, com-bined with other test results. CEA levels may be one ofthe criteria for determining whether the patient will bene-fit from more expensive studies, such as CT scan or MRI.\nPrecautions\nThe CEA test is not a screening test for cancer. It is\nnot useful for detecting the presence of cancer. Manycancers do not produce an increased CEA level. Somenoncancerous diseases, such as hepatitis, inflammatorybowel disease, pancreatitis , and obstructive pulmonary\ndisease, may cause an elevated CEA level.\nDescription\nDetermination of the CEA level is a laboratory\nblood test. Obtaining a specimen of blood for the studytakes only a few minutes. CEA testing should be coveredby most insurance plans.\nPreparation\nNo preparation is required.\nAftercare\nNone.\nRisks\nThere are no complications or side effects of this\ntest. However, the results of a CEA study should be inter-preted with caution. A single test result may not yieldclinically useful information. Several studies over a peri-od of months may be needed.\nAnother concern is the potential for false positive as\nwell as false negative results. A false positive resultmeans the test shows an abnormal value when cancer isnot present. A false negative means the test reveals a nor-mal value when cancer actually is present.\nNormal results\nThe absolute numbers which are considered normal\nvary from one laboratory to another. Any results reportedshould come with information regarding the testing facil-\nity’s normal range.\nAbnormal results\nA single abnormal CEA value may be significant,\nbut must be regarded cautiously. In general, very highCEA levels indicate more serious cancer, with a poorerchance for cure. But some benign diseases and certaincancer treatments may produce an elevated CEA test.Cigarette smoking will also cause the CEA level to be\nabnormally high.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCooper, Dennis L. “Tumor Markers.” In Cecil Textbook of\nMedicine , ed.

A cardiac blood pool scan isused to determine how efficiently the left ventricle isworking. The scan can detect aneurysms of the left ven-tricle, motion abnormalities caused by damage to theheart wall, cardiac shunts between the left and right ven-tricle, and coronary occlusive artery disease.\nPrecautions\nPregnant women are the only patients who should\nnot participate in a cardiac blood pool scan. However, theaccuracy of the results may be affected if the patientmoves during imaging, has had other recent nuclearscans, or has an irregular heartbeat.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 654Cardiac blood pool scanGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 654Description\nA cardiac blood pool scan is sometimes called\nequilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography or gated(synchronized) cardiac blood pool imaging. A multi-\nple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan is a variation of\nthis test.\nTo perform a cardiac blood pool scan, the patient\nlies under a special gamma scintillation camera thatdetects radiation. A protein tagged with a radioactivemarker (usually technetium-99m) is injected into thepatient’s forearm.\nThe camera is synchronized with an electrocardio-\ngram (ECG) to take a picture at specific times in thecycle of heart contraction and relaxation. When datafrom many sequential pictures is processed by a comput-er, a doctor can analyze whether the left ventricle is func-tioning normally.\nThe patient needs to remain silent and motionless\nduring the test. Sometimes the patient is asked to exer-\ncise, then another set of pictures is taken for comparison.\nThis test normally takes about 30 minutes.\nPreparation\nNo changes in diet or medication are necessary.

    "content": "Cardiac catheterization\nDefinition\nCardiac catheterization (also called heart catheteri-\nzation) is a diagnostic procedure which does a compre-hensive examination of how the heart and its blood ves-sels function. One or more catheters is inserted through aperipheral blood vessel in the arm (antecubital artery orvein) or leg (femoral artery or vein) with x-ray guidance.This procedure gathers information such as adequacy ofblood supply through the coronary arteries, blood pres-sures, blood flow throughout chambers of the heart, col-lection of blood samples, and x rays of the heart’s ventri-cles or arteries.\nA test that can be performed on either side of the\nheart, cardiac catheterization checks for different func-tions in both the left and right sides. When testing theheart’s right side, tricuspid and pulmonary valve function\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 655Cardiac catheterizationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 655are evaluated, in addition to measuring pressures of and\ncollecting blood samples from the right atrium, ventricle,and pulmonary artery. Left-sided heart catheterization isperformed by way of a catheter through an artery whichtests the blood flow of the coronary arteries, function ofthe mitral and aortic valves, and left ventricle.\nPurpose\nThe primary reason for conducting a cardiac\ncatheterization is to diagnose and manage persons knownor suspected to have heart disease, a frequently fatal con-dition that leads to 1.5 million heart attacks annually inthe United States.\nSymptoms and diagnoses that may lead to perform-\ning this procedure include:\n• chest pain , characterized by prolonged heavy pressure\nor a squeezing pain\n• abnormal treadmill stress test\n• myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack\n• congenital heart defects, or heart problems that origi-\nnated from birth\n• a diagnosis of valvular-heart disease• a need to measure the heart muscle’s ability to pump\nblood\nTypically performed along with angiography , a tech-\nnique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outlinethe heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in thevisualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalitiesin the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi-ologist may assess the patient’s need and readiness forcoronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasiveapproach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel eithersurgically or with the use of a balloon ( angioplasty ).\nWhen looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro-\nscopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses tobe assessed:\n• enlargement of the left ventricle• ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood\nvessel)\n• narrowing of the aortic valve• insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve• the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the\nother due to septal defects (also known as shunting)\nPrecautions\nCardiac catheterization is categorized as an “inva-\nsive” procedure which involves the heart, its valves, andcoronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm\nor leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important toevaluate for the following conditions before consideringthis procedure:\n• A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func-\ntion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi-tions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro-cedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure.\n• A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected,\nantibiotics may be given before the test to prevent\ninflammation of the membrane which lines the heart(endocarditis).\nDescription\nTo understand how a cardiac catheterization is able\nto diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work-ings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just asthe body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in itseveryday functions, so does the heart. The heart is madeup of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter-ies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy-gen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality inany of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart’sfunction. These abnormalities cause the heart’s bloodflow to decrease and result in the condition known ascoronary artery disease or coronary insufficiency.\nCatheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and\ntreating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use offluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which mayresemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through theveins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist canmonitor a body’s various functions at each moment.\nGenerally a test that lasts two to three hours, a\npatient should expect the following prior to and duringthe catheterization procedure:\n• A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient\nto relax but remain conscious during the test.\n• An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to\nadminister medication. Electrodes will be attached tothe chest to enable the painless procedure known as anelectrocardiograph.\n• Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the\narm or leg, the incision site will be made numb byinjecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic isinjected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quickstinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced asthe catheter travels through the blood vessel.\n• After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery\nsystem, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) isinjected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 656Cardiac catheterizationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 656of the heart. During this time, the patient may experi-\nence a hot, flushed feeling or a quickly passing nausea.Coughing or breathing deeply aids in any discomfort.\n• Medication may be given during the procedure if chest\npain is experienced, and nitroglycerin may also be admin-istered to allow expansion of the heart’s blood vessels.\n• When the test is complete, the physician will remove the\ncatheter and close the skin with several sutures or tape.\nPreparation\nPrior to the cardiac catheterization procedure, it is\nimportant to relay information to the physician or nurseregarding allergies to shellfish (such as shrimp or scal-\nlops) which contain iodine, iodine itself, or the dyes thatare commonly used in other diagnostic tests.\nBecause this procedure is categorized as a surgery, the\npatient will be instructed not to eat or drink anything for atleast six hours prior to the test. Just before the test begins,the patient will urinate and change into a hospital gown,then lie flat on a padded table that may also be tilted inorder for the heart to be examined from a variety of angles.\nAftercare\nWhile cardiac catheterization may be performed on\nan outpatient basis, a patient may require close monitor-ing following the procedure while remaining in the hos-pital for at least 24 hours. The patient will be instructedto rest in bed for at least eight hours immediately afterthe test. If the catheter was inserted into a vein or arteryin the leg or groin area, the leg will be kept extended forfour to six hours. If a vein or artery in the arm was usedto insert the catheter, the arm will need to remain extend-ed for a minimum of three hours.\nThe patient should expect a hard ridge to form over\nthe incision site that diminishes as the site heals. Bluishdiscoloration under the skin at the point of insertionshould also be expected but fades in two weeks. It is alsonot uncommon for the incision site to bleed during thefirst 24 hours following surgery. If this should happen,the patient should apply pressure to the site with a cleantissue or cloth for 10–15 minutes.\nRisks\nSimilar to all surgical procedures, the cardiac\ncatheterization test does involve some risks. Complica-tions that may occur during the procedure include\n• cardiac arrhythmias (an irregular heart beat)\n• pericardial tamponade (a condition that causes excess\npressure in the pericardium which affects the heart dueto accumulation of excess fluid)• the rare occurrence of myocardial infarction (heart\nattack) or stroke may also develop due to clotting or\nplaque rupture of one or more of the coronary or brainarteries.\nBefore left-side catheterization is performed, the\nanticoagulant medication heparin may be administered.This drug helps decrease the risk of the development of ablood clot in an artery (thrombosis) and blood clots trav-eling throughout the body (embolization).\nThe risks of the catheterization procedure increase\nin patients over the age of 60, those who have severeheart failure , or persons with serious valvular heart\ndisease .\nNormal results\nNormal findings from a cardiac catheterization will\nindicate no abnormalities of heart chamber size or con-figuration, wall motion or thickness, the direction ofblood flow, or motion of the valves. Smooth and regularoutlines on the x ray indicate normal coronary arteries.\nAn essential part of the catheterization is measuring\nintracardiac pressures, or the pressure in the heart’schambers and vessels. Pressure readings that are higher\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 657Cardiac catheterization\nThe catheter\nextends from the groin area to the heart.\nThe cardiac catheter runs from the groin to the heart.

The pressure readings that are lower, other than thosewhich are produced as a result of shock , typically are not\nsignificant.\nAn ejection fraction, or a comparison of how much\nblood is ejected from the heart’s left ventricle during itscontraction phase with a measurement of blood remain-ing at the end of the left ventricle’s relaxation phase, isalso determined by performing a catheterization. Thecardiologist will look for a normal ejection fraction read-ing of 60–70%.\nAbnormal results\nCardiac catheterization provides valuable still and\nmotion x-ray pictures of the coronary arteries that help indiagnosing coronary artery disease, poor heart function,disease of the heart valves, and septal defects (a defect inthe septum, the wall that separates two heart chambers).\nThe most prominent sign of coronary artery disease\nis the narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries,with narrowing that is greater than 70% considered sig-nificant. A clear indication for intervention (by angio-plasty or surgery) is a finding of significant narrowingof the left main coronary artery and/or blockage orsevere narrowing in the high, left anterior descendingcoronary artery.KEY TERMS\nAneurysm —An abnormal dilatation of a blood ves-\nsel, usually an artery. It can be caused by a congeni-tal defect or weakness in the vessel’s wall.\nAngiography —In cardiac catheterization, a picture\nof the heart and coronary arteries is seen afterinjecting a radiopaque substance (often referred toas a dye) throughout the veins and arteries.\nAngioplasty —An alternative to vascular surgery, a\nballoon catheter is used to mechanically dilate theaffected area of the artery and enlarge the constrict-ed or narrowed segment.\nAortic valve —The valve between the heart’s left\nventricle and ascending aorta that prevents regurgi-tation of blood back into the left ventricle.\nCatheter —A tube made of elastic, elastic web, rub-\nber, glass, metal, or plastic used to evacuate or injectfluids into the body. In cardiac catheterization, along, fine catheter is used for passage through ablood vessel into the chambers of the heart.Coronary bypass surgery —A surgical procedure\nwhich places a shunt to allow blood to travel fromthe aorta to a branch of the coronary artery at apoint past an obstruction.\nLeft anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) —\nOne of the heart’s coronary artery branches fromthe left main coronary artery which supplies bloodto the left ventricle.\nMitral valve —The bicuspid valve which is between\nthe left atrium and left ventricle of the heart.\nPulmonary valve —The heart valve which is posi-\ntioned between the right ventricle and the openinginto the pulmonary artery.\nShunt— A passageway (or an artificially created pas-\nsageway) that diverts blood flow from one mainroute to another.\nTricuspid valve —The right atrioventricular valve of\nthe heart.\nA finding of impaired wall motion is an additional\nindicator of coronary artery disease, aneurysm, anenlarged heart, or a congenital heart problem. Using thefindings from an ejection fraction test which measureswall motion, cardiologists look at an ejection fractionreading under 35% as increasing the risk of complica-tions while also decreasing a successful long term orshort term outcome with surgery.\nDetecting the difference in pressure above and\nbelow the heart valve can verify heart valve disease. Thegreater narrowing correlates with the higher pressure dif-ference.\nTo confirm septal defects, a catheterization measures\noxygen content on both the left and right sides of theheart. The right heart pumps unoxygenated blood to thelungs, and the left heart pumps blood that contains oxy-gen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Right side ele-vated oxygen levels indicate left-to-right atrial or ven-\ntricular shunt . A left side that experiences decreased\noxygen indicates a right-to-left shunt.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med-\nicine. Philadelphia: W. B.

Patients with advanced coronarydisease may require continuous ECG monitoringthroughout their exercise sessions. Once dischargedfrom the hospital, the patient works with his cardiacteam to create an individual exercise plan.\n• Diet. Cardiac patients will work with a nutritionist or\ndietician to develop a low-fat, low-cholesterol dietplan. Patients with high blood pressure may be put on asalt-restricted diet and instructed to limit alcoholintake. Weight loss may also be a goal with obese car-diac patients.\n• Counseling. A psychologist or social worker can help\ncardiac patients with issues that may be contributing totheir heart condition, such as stress and anxiety . Relax-\nation techniques may be taught to patients to help themdeal with these feelings. Cardiac patients frequentlyexperience a period of depression, and group or indi-vidual counseling can be beneficial in overcomingthese feelings. V ocational counselors can assist cardiacpatients in returning to the workforce.\n• Education. The patient and family should be fully edu-\ncated on the physical limitations of the patient, his rec-ommended diet and exercise plan, his emotional status,and the lifestyle changes required to improve thepatient’s overall health.\n•Smoking cessation.

    "title": "Cardiac tamponade",
    "content": "Cardiac tamponade\nDefinition\nCardiac tamponade occurs when the heart is\nsqueezed by fluid that collects inside the sac that sur-rounds it.\nDescription\nThe heart is surrounded by a sac called the pericardi-\num. When this sac becomes filled with fluid, the liquidpresses on the heart, preventing the lower chambers ofthe heart from properly filling with blood.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 660Cardiac tamponadeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 660Because the lower chambers (the ventricles) cannot fill\nwith the correct amount of blood, less than normal amountsof blood reach the lungs and the rest of the body. This con-dition is very serious and can be fatal if not treated.\nCauses and symptoms\nFluid can collect inside the pericardium and com-\npress the heart when the kidneys do not properly removewaste from the blood, when the pericardium swells fromunknown causes, from infection, or when the pericardiumis damaged by cancer . Blunt or penetrating injury from\ntrauma to the chest or heart can also result in cardiac tam-ponade when large amounts of blood fill the pericardium.Tamponade can also occur during heart surgery.\nWhen the heart is compressed by the surrounding\nfluid, three conditions occur: a reduced amount of bloodis pumped to the body by the heart, the lower chambersof the ventricles are filled with a less than normal amountof blood, and higher than normal blood pressures occurinside the heart, caused by the pressure of the fluid push-ing in on the heart from the outside.\nWhen tamponade occurs because of trauma, the\nsound of the heart beats can become faint, and the bloodpressure in the arteries decreases, while the blood pres-sure in the veins increases.\nIn cases of tamponade caused by more slowly devel-\noping diseases, shortness of breath , a feeling of tight-\nness in the chest, increased blood pressure in the largeveins in the neck (the jugular veins), weight gain, andfluid retention by the body can occur.\nDiagnosis\nWhen cardiac tamponade is suspected, accurate diag-\nnosis can be life-saving. The most accurate way to identi-fy this condition is by using a test called an echocardio-gram. This test uses sound waves to create an image ofthe heart and its surrounding sac, making it easy to visual-ize any fluid that has collected inside the sac.\nTreatment\nIf the abnormal fluid buildup in the pericardial sac is\ncaused by cancer or kidney disease, drugs used to treatthese conditions can help lessen the amount of fluid col-lecting inside the sac. Drugs that help maintain normalblood pressure throughout the body can also help thiscondition; however, these drugs are only a temporarytreatment. The fluid within the pericardium must bedrained out to reduce the pressure on the heart andrestore proper heart pumping.\nThe fluid inside the pericardium is drained by insert-\ning a needle through the chest and into the sac itself. ThisKEY TERMS\nPericardiocentesis —A procedure used to drain\nfluid out of the sac surrounding the heart. This isdone by inserting a needle through the chest andinto the sac.\nallows the fluid to flow out of the sac, relieving the\nabnormal pressure on the heart. This procedure is calledpericardiocentesis . In severe cases, a tube (catheter) can\nbe inserted into the sac or a section of the sac can be sur-gically cut away to allow for more drainage.\nPrognosis\nThis condition is life-threatening. However, drug\ntreatments can be helpful, and surgical treatments cansuccessfully drain the trapped fluid, though it may reac-cumulate. Some risk of death exists with surgical\ndrainage of the accumulated fluid.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBraunwald, Eugene. “Pericardial Disease.” In Harrison’s Prin-\nciples of Internal Medicine , ed.

CPR should beperformed if a person is unconscious and not breathing.Respiratory and cardiac arrest can be caused by allergicreactions, an ineffective heartbeat, asphyxiation, breath-ing passages that are blocked, choking , drowning, drug\nreactions or overdoses, electric shock, exposure to cold,severe shock, or trauma. CPR can be performed bytrained bystanders or healthcare professionals on infants,children, and adults. It should always be performed bythe person on the scene who is most experienced in CPR.\nPrecautions\nCPR should never be performed on a healthy person\nbecause it can cause serious injury to a beating heart byinterfering with normal heartbeats.\nDescription\nCPR is part of the emergency cardiac care system\ndesigned to save lives. Many deaths can be prevented byprompt recognition of the problem and notification of theemergency medical system (EMS), followed by earlyCPR, defibrillation (which delivers a brief electric\nshock to the heart in attempt to get the heart to beat nor-mally), and advanced cardiac life support measures.\nCPR must be performed within four to six minutes\nafter cessation of breathing so as to prevent brain damageor death . It is a two-part procedure that involves rescue\nbreathing and external chest compressions. To provideoxygen to a person’s lungs, the rescuer administers mouth-to-mouth breaths, then helps circulate blood through theheart to vital organs by external chest compressions.Mouth-to-mouth breathing and external chest compressionshould be performed together, but if the rescuer is notstrong enough to do both, the external chest compressionsshould be done. This is more effective than no resuscita-tion attempt, as is CPR that is performed “poorly.”\nWhen performed by a bystander, CPR is designed to\nsupport and maintain breathing and circulation untilemergency medical personnel arrive and take over. Whenperformed by healthcare personnel, it is used in conjunc-tion with other basic and advanced life support measures.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, early\nCPR and defibrillation combined with early advancedemergency care can increase survival rates for peoplewith a type of abnormal heart beat called ventricular\nfibrillation by as much as 40%. CPR by bystanders may\nprolong life during deadly ventricular fibrillation, givingemergency medical service personnel time to arrive.\nHowever, many CPR attempts are not ultimately\nsuccessful in restoring a person to a good quality of life.Often, there is brain damage even if the heart starts beat-ing again. CPR is therefore not generally recommendedfor the chronically or terminally ill or frail elderly. Forthese people, it represents a traumatic and not a peacefulend of life.\nEach year, CPR helps save thousands of lives in the\nUnited States. More than five million Americans annual-ly receive training in CPR through American Heart Asso-ciation and American Red Cross courses. In addition tocourses taught by instructors, the American Heart Asso-ciation also has an interactive video called Learning Sys-tem, which is available at more than 500 healthcare insti-tutions. Both organizations teach CPR the same way, butuse different terms. These organizations recommend thatfamily members or other people who live with peoplewho are at risk for respiratory or cardiac arrest be trainedin CPR. A hand-held device called a CPR Prompt isavailable to walk people trained in CPR through the pro-cedure, using American Heart Association guidelines.CPR has been practiced for more than 40 years.\nPerforming CPR\nThe basic procedure for CPR is the same for all peo-\nple, with a few modifications for infants and children toaccount for their smaller size.\nPERFORMING CPR ON AN ADULT. The first step is to\ncall the emergency medical system for help by telephon-ing 911; then to begin CPR, following these steps:\n• The rescuer opens a person’s airway by placing the\nhead face up, with the forehead tilted back and the chinlifted. The rescuer checks again for breathing (three tofive seconds), then begins rescue breathing (mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration), pinching the nostrils shutwhile holding the chin in the other hand. The rescuer’smouth is placed against the unconscious person’smouth with the lips making a tight seal, then gentlyexhales for about one to one and a half seconds. Therescuer breaks away for a moment and then repeats.The person’s head is repositioned after each mouth-to-mouth breath.\n• After two breaths, the rescuer checks the unconscious\nperson’s pulse by moving the hand that was under theperson’s chin to the artery in the neck (carotid artery).If the unconscious person has a heartbeat, the rescuercontinues rescue breathing until help arrives or the per-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 662Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 662GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 663Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nFigure B\nFigure CFigure D\nFigure EFigure A\nFigure F\nCPR in basic life support.

(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 663son begins breathing without assistance. If the uncon-\nscious person is breathing, the rescuer turns the persononto his or her side.\n• If there is no heartbeat, the rescuer performs chest com-\npressions. The rescuer kneels next to the unconsciousperson, placing the heel of one hand in the spot on thelower chest where the two halves of the rib cage cometogether. The rescuer puts one hand on top of the otheron the person’s chest and interlocks the fingers. Thearms are straightened, the rescuer’s shoulders are posi-tioned directly above the hands on the unconscious per-son’s chest. The hands are pressed down, using only thepalms, so that the person’s breastbone sinks in about1.5–2 inches. The rescuer releases pressure withoutremoving the hands, then repeats about 15 times per10–15 second intervals.\n• The rescuer tilts the unconscious person’s head and\nreturns to rescue breathing for one or two quick breaths.Then breathing and chest compressions are alternatedfor one minute before checking for a pulse. If the res-cuer finds signs of a heartbeat and breathing, CPR isstopped. If the unconscious person is breathing but hasno pulse, the chest compressions are continued. If theunconscious person has a pulse but is not breathing,rescue breathing is continued.\n• For children over the age of eight, the rescuer performs\nCPR exactly as for an adult.\nPERFORMING CPR ON AN INFANT OR CHILD UNDER\nTHE AGE OF EIGHT. The procedures outlined above are\nfollowed with these differences:\n• The rescuer administers CPR for one minute, then calls\nfor help.\n• The rescuer makes a seal around the child’s mouth or\ninfant’s nose and mouth to give gentle breaths. The res-cuer delivers 20 rescue breaths per minute, taking 1.5–2seconds for each breath.\n• Chest compressions are given with only one hand for a\nchild and with two or three fingers for an infant. Thebreastbone is depressed only 1–1.5 in (2.5–3.8 cm) fora child and 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) for an infant, and therescuer gives at least 100 chest compressions perminute.\nNew developments in CPR\nSome new ways of performing CPR have been tried.\nActive compression-decompression resuscitation, ab-dominal compression done in between chest compres-sions, and chest compression using a pneumatic vesthave all been tested but none are currently recommendedfor routine use.The active compression-decompression device was\ndeveloped to improve blood flow from the heart, but clini-cal studies have found no significant difference in survivalbetween standard and active compression-decompressionCPR. Interposed abdominal counterpulsation, whichrequires two or more rescuers, one compressing the chestand the other compressing the abdomen, was developed toimprove pressure and therefore blood flow. It has beenshown in a small study to improve survival but more datais needed. A pneumatic vest, which circles the chest of anunconscious person and compresses it, increases pressurewithin the chest during external chest compression. Thevest has been shown to improve survival in a preliminarystudy but more data is necessary for a full assessment.\nPreparation\nIf a person suddenly becomes unconscious, a rescuer\nshould call out for help from other bystanders, and thendetermine if the unconscious person is responsive bygently shaking the shoulder and shouting a question.Upon receiving no answer, the rescuer should call theemergency medical system. The rescuer should check tosee whether the unconscious person is breathing bykneeling near the person’s shoulders, looking at the per-son’s chest, and placing a cheek next to the unconsciousperson’s mouth. The rescuer should look for signs ofbreathing in the chest and abdomen, and listen and feelfor signs of breathing through the person’s lips. If nosigns of breathing are present after three to five seconds,CPR should be started.\nAftercare\nEmergency medical care is always necessary after\nsuccessful CPR. Once a person’s breathing and heartbeathave been restored, the rescuer should make the personcomfortable and stay there until emergency medical per-sonnel arrive. The rescuer can continue to reassure theperson that help is coming and talk positively until pro-fessionals arrive and take over.\nRisks\nCPR can cause injury to a person’s ribs, liver, lungs,\nand heart. However, these risks must be accepted if CPRis necessary to save the person’s life.\nNormal results\nIn many cases, successful CPR results in restoration\nof consciousness and life. Barring other injuries, arevived person usually returns to normal functions withina few hours of being revived.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 664Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 664Abnormal results\nThese include injuries incurred during CPR and lack\nof success with CPR.

    "content": "Carpal tunnel syndrome\nDefinition\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a disorder caused by\ncompression at the wrist of the median nerve supplyingthe hand, causing numbness and tingling .\nDescription\nThe carpal tunnel is an area in the wrist where the\nbones and ligaments create a small passageway for themedian nerve. The median nerve is responsible for bothsensation and movement in the hand, in particular thethumb and first three fingers. When the median nerve iscompressed, an individual’s hand will feel as if it has“gone to sleep.”\nWomen between the ages of 30 and 60 have the\nhighest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research hasdemonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a very sig-nificant cause of missed work days due to pain . In 1995,\nabout $270 million was spent on sick days taken for painfrom repetitive motion injuries.\nCauses and symptoms\nCompression of the median nerve in the wrist can\noccur during a number of different conditions, particular-ly those conditions which lead to changes in fluid accu-mulation throughout the body. Because the area of thewrist through which the median nerve passes is very nar-row, any swelling in the area will lead to pressure on themedian nerve. This pressure will ultimately interferewith the nerve’s ability to function normally. Pregnancy ,\nobesity , arthritis, certain thyroid conditions, diabetes,\nand certain pituitary abnormalities all predispose tocarpal tunnel syndrome. Other conditions which increasethe risk for carpal tunnel syndrome include some forms\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 667Carpal tunnel syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 667of arthritis and various injuries to the arm and wrist\n(including fractures , sprains, and dislocations). Further-\nmore, activities which cause an individual to repeatedlybend the wrist inward toward the forearm can predisposeto carpal tunnel syndrome. Certain jobs which requirerepeated strong wrist motions carry a relatively high riskof carpal tunnel syndrome. Injuries of this type arereferred to as “repetitive motion” injuries, and are morefrequent among secretaries doing a lot of typing, peopleworking at computer keyboards or cash registers, factoryworkers, and some musicians.\nSymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numb-\nness, burning, tingling, and a prickly pin-like sensationover the palm surface of the hand, and into the thumb,forefinger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger.Some individuals notice a shooting pain which goes fromthe wrist up the arm, or down into the hand and fingers.With continued median nerve compression, an individualmay begin to experience muscle weakness, making it dif-ficult to open jars and hold objects with the affected\nhand. Eventually, the muscles of the hand served by themedian nerve may begin to grow noticeably smaller(atrophy), especially the fleshy part of the thumb.Untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome may eventually resultin permanent weakness, loss of sensation, or even paral-\nysisof the thumb and fingers of the affected hand.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made in\npart by checking to see whether the patient’s symptomscan be brought on by holding his or her hand in positionwith wrist bent for about a minute. Wrist x rays are oftentaken to rule out the possibility of a tumor causing pres-sure on the median nerve. A physician examining a patientsuspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome will perform avariety of simple tests to measure muscle strength and sen-sation in the affected hand and arm. Further testing mightinclude electromyographic or nerve conduction velocitytesting to determine the exact severity of nerve damage.These tests involve stimulating the median nerve withelectricity and measuring the resulting speed and strengthof the muscle response, as well as recording speed ofnerve transmission across the carpel tunnel.\nTreatment\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is initially treated with\nsplints, which support the wrist and prevent it from flex-ing inward into the position which exacerbates mediannerve compression. Some people get significant relief bywearing such splints to sleep at night, while others willneed to wear the splints all day, especially if they are per-forming jobs which stress the wrist. Ibuprofen or other\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be pre-\nscribed to decrease pain and swelling. When carpal tun-nel syndrome is more advanced, injection of steroids intothe wrist to decrease inflammation may be necessary.\nThe most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome\nmay require surgery to decrease the compression of themedian nerve and restore its normal function. Such arepair involves cutting that ligament which crosses thewrist, thus allowing the median nerve more room anddecreasing compression. This surgery is done almostexclusively on an outpatient basis and is often performedwithout the patient having to be made unconscious. Care-ful injection of numbing medicines (local anesthesia) ornerve blocks (the injection of anesthetics directly into thenerve) create sufficient numbness to allow the surgery tobe performed painlessly, without the risks associated withgeneral anesthesia. Recovery from this type of surgery isusually quick and without complications.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 668Carpal tunnel syndromeCarpal tunnel ligament\nMedian nerve\nCarpal tunnel ligament (severed)\nMedian nerve\nThe most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome may\nrequire surgery to decrease the compression of the mediannerve and restore its normal function.This procedureinvolves severing the ligament that crosses the wrist, thusallowing the median nerve more room and decreasing com-pression.

    "title": "Cat-scratch disease",
    "content": "Cat-scratch disease\nDefinition\nCat-scratch disease is an uncommon infection that\ntypically results from a cat’s scratch or bite. Most suffer-ers experience only moderate discomfort and find thattheir symptoms clear up without any lasting harm after afew weeks or months. Professional medical treatment israrely needed.\nDescription\nCat-scratch disease (also called cat-scratch fever ) is\ncaused by the Bartonella henselae bacterium, which is\nfound in cats around the world and is transmitted fromcat to cat by fleas. Researchers have discovered that largenumbers of North American cats carry antibodies for thedisease (meaning that the cats have been infected at somepoint in their lives). Some parts of North America havemuch higher rates of cat infection than others, however.Bartonella henselae is uncommon or absent in cold cli-\nmates, which fleas have difficulty tolerating, but preva-lent in warm, humid places such as Memphis, Tennessee,where antibodies were found in 71% of the cats tested.The bacterium, which remains in a cat’s bloodstream forseveral months after infection, seems to be harmless tomost cats, and normally an infected cat will not displayany symptoms. Kittens (cats less than one year old) aremore likely than adult cats to be carrying the infection.\nBartonella henselae can infect people who are\nscratched or (more rarely) bitten or licked by a cat. Itcannot be passed from person to person. Although catsare popular pets found in about 30% of American house-holds, human infection appears to be rare. One studyestimated that for every 100,000 Americans there areonly 2.5 cases of cat-scratch disease each year (2.5/100,000). It is also unusual for more than one familymember to become ill; a Florida investigation discoveredmultiple cases in only 3.5% of the families studied. Chil-dren and teenagers appear to be the most likely victimsof cat-scratch disease, although the possibility exists that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 669Cat-scratch diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 669the disease may be more common among adults than pre-\nviously thought.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe first sign of cat-scratch disease may be a small\nblister at the site of a scratch or bite three to 10 days afterinjury. The blister (which sometimes contains pus) oftenlooks like an insect bite and is usually found on the hands,arms, or head. Within two weeks of the blister’s appear-ance, lymph nodes near the site of injury become swollen.Often the infected person develops a fever or experiencesfatigue or headaches. The symptoms usually disappear\nwithin a month, although the lymph nodes may remainswollen for several months. Hepatitis, pneumonia , and\nother dangerous complications can arise, but the likelihoodof cat-scratch disease posing a serious threat to health isvery small. AIDS patients and other immunocompromised\npeople face the greatest risk of dangerous complications.\nOccasionally, the symptoms of cat-scratch disease take\nthe form of what is called Parinaud’s oculoglandular syn-drome. In such cases, a small sore develops on the palpe-bral conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inner eyelid),and is often accompanied by conjunctivitis (inflammation\nof the membrane) and swollen lymph nodes in front of theear.

Rubbing one’s eyes after handling thecat then transmits the bacteria to the conjunctiva.\nDiagnosis\nA family doctor should be called whenever a cat\nscratch or bite fails to heal normally or is followed by apersistent fever or other unusual symptoms such as long-lasting bone or joint pain . The appearance of painful and\nswollen lymph nodes is another reason for consulting adoctor. When cat-scratch disease is suspected, the doctorwill ask about a history of exposure to cats and look forevidence of a cat scratch or bite and swollen lymphnodes. A blood test for Bartonella henselae may be\nordered to confirm the doctor’s diagnosis.\nTreatment\nFor otherwise healthy people, rest and over-the-\ncounter medications for reducing fever and discomfort(such as acetaminophen ) while waiting for the disease\nto run its course are usually all that is necessary. Antibi-\notics are prescribed in some cases, particularly when\ncomplications occur or the lymph nodes remain swollenand painful for more than two or three months, but thereis no agreement among doctors about when and how theyshould be used. If a lymph node becomes very swollenand painful, the family doctor may decide to drain it.\nPrognosis\nMost people recover completely from a bout of cat-\nscratch disease. Further attacks are rare.\nPrevention\nCertain common-sense precautions can be taken to\nguard against the disease. Scratches and bites should bewashed immediately with soap and water, and it is nevera good idea to rub one’s eyes after handling a cat withoutfirst washing one’s hands. Children should be told not toplay with stray cats or make cats angry. Immunocompro-mised people should avoid owning kittens, which aremore likely than adult cats to be infectious. Because cat-scratch disease is usually not a life-threatening illnessand people tend to form strong emotional bonds withtheir cats, doctors do not recommend getting rid of a catsuspected of carrying the disease.\nResources\nBOOKS\nTompkins, Lucy Stuart. “Bartonella Infections, Including Cat-\nScratch Disease.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 670Cat-scratch diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 670Medicine , ed.

    "content": "Cataract surgery\nDefinition\nCataract surgery is a procedure performed to remove\na cloudy lens from the eye; usually an intraocular lens isimplanted at the same time.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of cataract surgery is to restore clear\nvision. It is indicated when cloudy vision due tocataracts has progressed to such an extent that it inter-\nferes with normal daily activities.\nPrecautions\nCataract surgery is not performed on both eyes at\nonce. To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in theevent of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye isallowed to heal before the cataract is removed from thesecond eye.\nThe presence of cataracts can mask additional eye\nproblems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctorsnor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since suchconditions will continue to impair sight after cataractremoval if they are not identified and treated, the eventu-al outcome of cataract surgery will depend on the out-come of other problems.\nIn 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery can\ncontribute to the progression of age-related macular\ndegeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is the\ndegeneration of the central part of the retina. According-ly, ARMD patients with cataracts must weigh the risks ofthe loss of central vision, within four or five years,against short-term improvement. When an ARMDpatient chooses cataract surgery, the surgeon shouldshield the retina against bright light to protect it frompossible light-induced damage during surgery and installan intraocular lens capable of absorbing ultraviolet andblue light, which seem to do the most damage.KEY TERMS\nAge-related macular degeneration (ARMD) —\nDegeneration of the macula (the central part of theretina where the rods and cones are most dense)that leads to loss of central vision in people over 60.\nCataract —Progressive opacity or clouding of an\neye lens, which obstructs the passage of light tothe retina.\nCornea —Clear outer covering of the front of the eye.\nIntraocular lens —Lens made of silicone or plastic\nplaced within the eye; can be corrective.\nRetina —Innermost layer at the back of the eye,\nwhich contains light receptors, the rods and cones.\nDescription\nThere are two types of cataract surgery: intracapsular\nand extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the removal ofboth the lens and the thin capsule that surround them.This type of surgery was common before 1980, but hassince been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removalof the capsule requires a large incision and doesn’t allowcomfortable intraocular lens implantation. Thus, peoplewho undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have longrecovery periods and have to wear very thick glasses.\nExtracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of\nthe lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year inthe United States, over a million cataracts are removedthis way.\nThere are two methods for extracapsular cataract\nsurgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification. Atiny incision (about 0.12 in or 3 mm long) is made nextto the cornea (the eye’s outer covering), and an ultrasonicprobe is used to break the cataract into minute pieces,which are then removed by suction. When the lens is toohard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will usea different extracapsular technique requiring a largerincision. An incision about 0.37 in (9 mm) long is made,and the whole lens (without its capsule) is removedthrough the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extrac-tion leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone orplastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in aboutthe same location as the original lens.\nThe surgery takes about 30–60 minutes per eye.\nPreparation\nPatients must have a pre-operation eye examination ,\nwhich will include ultrasound analysis to make sure the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 671Cataract surgeryGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 671retina (the innermost layer of the eye, containing the light\nreceptors) is intact and also to measure eye curvature sothat a lens with the proper correction can be implanted.The patient will also have a pre-operative physical exam-\nination . In addition, patients start a course of antibiotic\neye drops or ointment the day before surgery.\nAftercare\nProper post-operative care is especially important after\ncataract surgery. Patients will need someone to drive themhome after the surgery and should not bend over or do any-thing strenuous for about two weeks. They should refrainfrom rubbing the eye, should wear glasses to protect theireye, and should wear a shield while sleeping so the eyewon’t be rubbed or bumped accidentally. The patient willusually continue their antibiotic for two to three weeks andwill also take anti-inflammatory medication for about thesame length of time. If the patient experiences inflamma-tion, redness, or pain, they should seek immediate medical\ntreatment to avoid serious complications.\nRisks\nCataract surgery itself is quite safe; over 90% of the\ntime, there are no complications. Possible complicationsinclude intraocular infection (endophthalmitis), central\nretinal inflammation (macular edema ), post-operative\nglaucoma ,retinal detachment , bleeding under the reti-\nna (choroidal hemorrhage), and tiny lens fragments inthe back (vitreous) cavity of the eye, all of which canlead to loss of sight.\nNormal results\nOrdinarily, patients experience improved visual acu-\nity and improved perception of the vividness of colors,leading to increased abilities in many activities, includingreading, needlework, driving, golf, and tennis, for exam-ple. In addition, sometimes implanted corrective lenseseliminate the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSalmans, Sandra. Your Eyes: Questions You Have. Answers You\nNeed.

    "content": "Cataracts\nDefinition\nA cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the normally\ntransparent crystalline lens of the eye. This cloudinesscan cause a decrease in vision and may lead to eventualblindness.\nDescription\nThe human eye has several parts. The outer layer of\nthe eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped corneaand an opaque, white sclera. The cornea and sclera helpprotect the eye. The next layer includes the iris, pupil, andciliary body. The iris is the colored part of the eye and thepupil is the small dark round hole in the middle of the iris.The pupil and iris allow light into the eye. The ciliary bodycontains muscles that help in the eye’s focusing ability.The lens lies behind the pupil and iris. It is covered by acellophane-like capsule. The lens is normally transparent,elliptical in shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticityallows the lens to focus on both near and far objects. Thelens is attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules ofZinn). Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules,which then change the shape of the lens. This process iscalled accommodation—the lens focuses images to helpmake vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens andchanges shape less easily. As a result, the accommodationprocess becomes more difficult, making it harder to seethings up close. This generally occurs around the age of 40and continues until about age 65. The condition is calledpresbyopia . It is a normal condition of aging , generally\nresulting in the need for reading glasses.\nThe lens is made up of approximately 35% protein\nand 65% water. As people age, degenerative changes inthe lens’ proteins occur. Changes in the proteins, watercontent, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of thereasons for the formation of a cataract.\nThe major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the cor-\ntex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of thelens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the capsule isthe outer layer. Opacities can occur in any area of thelens. Cataracts, then, can be classified according to loca-tion (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapular cataracts).The density and location of the cataract determines theamount of vision affected. If the cataract forms in the areaof the lens directly behind the pupil, vision may be signif-icantly impaired. A cataract that occurs on the outer edgesor side of the lens will create less of a visual problem.\nCataracts in the elderly are so common that they are\nthought to be a normal part of the aging process.Between the ages of 52 and 64, there is a 50% chance ofhaving a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 andolder are affected. Cataracts associated with aging (senileor age-related cataracts) most often occur in both eyes,with each cataract progressing at a different rate. Initial-ly, cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract remainssmall or at the periphery of the lens, the visual changesmay be minor.\nCataracts that occur in people other than the elderly\nare much less common. Congenital cataracts occur veryrarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an infection ordisease in the mother during pregnancy are among the\ncauses of congenital cataracts. Traumatic cataracts maydevelop after a foreign body or trauma injures the lens oreye. Systemic illnesses, such as diabetes, may result incataracts. Cataracts can also occur secondary to other eyediseases—for example, an inflammation of the innerlayer of the eye ( uveitis ) or glaucoma . Such cataracts are\ncalled complicated cataracts. Toxic cataracts result fromchemical toxicity, such as steroid use. Cataracts can alsoresult from exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.\nCauses and symptoms\nRecent studies have been conducted to try to deter-\nmine whether diet or the use of vitamins might have an\neffect on the formation of cataracts in older people. Theresults have been mixed, with some studies finding thatthere is a connection and other studies finding none.Much interest has been focused on the use of antioxidantsupplements as a protection against cataracts. Antioxidantvitamins such as vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene helpthe body clean-up oxygen-free radicals. Some vitaminsare marketed specifically for the eyes. Patients shouldspeak to their doctors about the use of such vitamins.\nSmoking and alcohol intake have been implicated in\ncataract formation. Some studies have determined that adiet high in fat will increase the likelihood of cataractformation, while an increase in foods rich in antioxidantswill reduce the incidence. More research is needed todetermine if diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vita-mins have any connection to the formation of cataracts.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 673CataractsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 673There are several common symptoms of cataracts:\n• gradual, painless onset of blurry, filmy, or fuzzy vision\n• poor central vision• frequent changes in eyeglass prescription• changes in color vision• increased glare from lights, especially oncoming head-\nlights when driving at night\n• “second sight” improvement in near vision (no longer\nneeding reading glasses), but a decrease in distancevision\n• poor vision in sunlight• presence of a milky whiteness in the pupil as the\ncataract progresses.\nDiagnosis\nBoth ophthalmologists and optometrists may detect\nand monitor cataract growth and prescribe prescriptionlenses for visual deficits. However, only an ophthalmolo-gist can perform cataract extraction.\nCataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of\nsymptoms, a visual acuity exam using an eye chart, andby examination of the eye itself. Shining a penlight intothe pupil may reveal opacities or a color change of thelens even before visual symptoms have developed. Aninstrument called a slit lamp is basically a large micro-scope. This lets the doctor examine the front of the eyeand the lens. The slit lamp helps the doctor determine thelocation of the cataract.\nSome other diagnostic tests may be used to deter-\nmine if cataracts are present or how well the patient maypotentially see after surgery. These include a glare test,potential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test.Treatment\nFor cataracts that cause no symptoms or only minor\nvisual changes, no treatment may be necessary. Continuedmonitoring and assessment of the cataract is needed by anophthalmologist or optometrist at scheduled office visits.Increased strength in prescription eyeglasses or contactlenses may be helpful. This may be all that is required ifthe cataract does not reduce the patient’s quality of life.\nCataract surgery—the only option for patients whose\ncataracts interfere with vision to the extent of affectingtheir daily lives—is the most frequently performed surgeryin the United States. It generally improves vision in over90% of patients. Some people have heard that a cataractshould be “ripe” before being removed. A “ripe” or maturecataract is when the lens is completely opaque. Mostcataracts are removed before they reach that stage. Some-times cataracts need to be removed so that the doctor canexamine the back of the eye more carefully. This is impor-tant in patients with diseases that may affect the eye. Ifcataracts are present in both eyes, only one eye at a timeshould be operated on. Healing occurs in the first eyebefore the second cataract is removed, sometimes as earlyas the following week. A final eyeglass prescription is usu-ally given about four to six weeks after surgery. Patientswill still need reading glasses. The overall health of thepatient needs to be considered in making the decision tooperate. However, age alone need not preclude effectivesurgical treatment of cataracts. People in their 90s canhave successful return of vision after cataract surgery .\nSurgery to remove cataracts is generally an outpa-\ntient procedure. A local anesthetic is used and the proce-dure lasts about an hour. Removal of the cloudy lens canbe done by several different procedures. The three typesof cataract surgery available are:\n• Extracapsular cataract extraction. This type of cataract\nextraction is the most common. The lens and the frontportion of the capsule are removed. The back part of thecapsule remains, providing strength to the eye.\n• Intracapsular cataract extraction. The lens and the\nentire capsule are removed. This method carries anincreased risk for detachment of the retina and swellingafter surgery. It is rarely used.\n• Phacoemulsification. This type of extracapsular extrac-\ntion needs a very small incision, resulting in faster heal-ing. Ultrasonic vibration is applied to the lens to breakit up into very small pieces which are then aspirated outof the eye with suction by the ophthalmologist.\nA replacement lens is usually inserted at the time of\nthe surgery. A plastic artificial lens called an intraocularlens (IOL) is placed in the remaining posterior lens cap-sule of the eye. When the intracapsular extraction\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 674Cataracts\nA dense cataract on lens of eye. (Photograph by Margaret\nCubberly, Phototake NYC. Reproduced by permission.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 674method is used, an IOL may be clipped onto the iris.\nContact lenses and cataract glasses (aphakic lenses) areprescribed if an IOL was not inserted. A folding IOL isused when phacoemulsification is performed to accom-modate the small incision.\nAntibiotic drops to prevent infection and steroids to\nreduce inflammation are prescribed after surgery. An eyeshield or glasses during the day will protect the eye frominjury while it heals. During the night, an eye shield isworn. The patient returns to the doctor the day aftersurgery for assessment, with several follow-up visits overthe next two months to monitor the healing process.\nPrognosis\nThe success rate of cataract extraction is very high,\nwith a good prognosis. A visual acuity of 20/40 or bettermay be achieved. If an extracapsular cataract extractionwas performed, a secondary cataract may develop in theremaining back portion of the capsule. This can occur oneto two years after surgery. YAG capsulotomy is most oftenused for this type of cataract. YAG stands for yttrium alu-minum garnet, the name of the laser used for this proce-dure. This is a painless outpatient procedure and requiresno incision. The laser beam makes a small opening in theremaining back part of the capsule, allowing light through.\nIn a very small percentage (3–5%) of surgical cataract\nextractions, complications occur. Infections, swelling ofthe cornea ( edema ), bleeding, retinal detachment , and\nthe onset of glaucoma have been reported. Some problemsmay occur one to two days, or even several weeks, aftersurgery. Any haziness, redness, decrease in vision, nausea,or pain should be reported to the surgeon immediately.\nPrevention\nPreventive measures emphasize protecting the eyes\nfrom UV radiation by wearing glasses with a special coatingto protect against UV rays. Dark lenses alone are not suffi-cient. The lenses must protect against UV light (specifically,UV-A and UV-B). Antioxidants may also provide some pro-tection by reducing free radicals that can damage lens pro-teins. A healthy diet rich in sources of antioxidants, includ-ing citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, green leafy vegeta-bles, and/or vitamin supplements may be helpful. When tak-ing certain medications, such as steroids, more frequent eyeexams may be necessary. Patients should speak to their doc-tors to see if medications may affect their eyes.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Cataract.” In Medical-Surgical Nursing: Concepts and Clini-\ncal Practice. 5th ed. Ed.

Catatonic excitement, or excessivemovement, is associated with violent behavior directedtoward oneself or others.\nFeatures of catatonia may also be seen in Neuroleptic\nMalignant Syndrome (NMS) which is an uncommon (butpotentially lethal) reaction to some medications used totreat major mental illnesses. NMS is considered a medicalemergency since 25% of untreated cases result in death .\nCatatonia can also be present in individuals sufferingfrom a number of other physical and emotional conditionssuch as drug intoxication, depression, and schizophrenia .\nIt is most commonly associated with mood disorders .\nDescription\nIn catatonic stupor, motor activity may be reduced to\nzero. Individuals avoid bathing and grooming, make littleor no eye contact with others, may be mute and rigid, andinitiate no social behaviors. In catatonic excitement theindividual is extremely hyperactive although the activityseems to have no purpose. Violence toward him/herselfor others may also be seen.\nNMS is observed as a dangerous side effect associat-\ned with certain neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs such ashaloperidol (Haldol). It comes on suddenly and is char-acterized by stiffening of the muscles, fever , confusion\nand heavy sweating.\nCatatonia can also be categorized as intrinsic or\nextrinsic. If the condition has an identifiable cause, it isdesignated as extrinsic. If no cause can be determinedfollowing physical examination , laboratory testing, and\nhistory taking, the illness is considered to be intrinsic.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of catatonia are largely unknown\nalthough research indicates that brain structure and func-tion are altered in this condition. While this and otherinformation point to a physical cause, none has yet beenproven. A variety of medical conditions also may lead tocatatonia including head trauma, cerebrovascular disease,encephalitis , and certain metabolic disorders. NMS is an\nadverse side effect of certain antipsychotic drugs .\nA variety of symptoms are associated with catatonia.\nAmong the more common are echopraxia (imitation ofthe gestures of others) and echolalia (parrot-like repeti-tion of words spoken by others).

    "title": "Catecholamines tests",
    "content": "Catecholamines tests\nDefinition\nCatecholamines is a collective term for the hormones\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Manufac-tured chiefly by the chromaffin cells of the adrenalglands, these hormones are involved in readying the bodyfor the “fight-or-flight” response (also known as the alarmreaction). When these hormones are released, the heartbeats stronger and faster, blood pressure rises, more bloodflows to the brain and muscles, the liver releases stores ofenergy as a sugar the body can readily use (glucose), therate of breathing increases and airways widen, and diges-tive activity slows. These reactions direct more oxygenand fuel to the organs most active in responding tostress—mainly the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles.\nPurpose\nPheochromocytoma (a tumor of the chromaffin\ncells of the adrenal gland) and tumors of the nervous sys-tem (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and gan-glioneuromas) that affect hormone production can causeexcessive levels of different catecholamines to be secret-ed. This results in constant or intermittent high bloodpressure ( hypertension ). Episodes of high blood pres-\nsure may be accompanied by symptoms such asheadache , sweating, palpitations , and anxiety . The cat-\necholamines test can be ordered, then, to determine ifhigh blood pressure and other symptoms are related toimproper hormone secretion and to identify the type oftumor causing elevated catecholamine levels.\nDescription\nThe catecholamines test can be performed on either\nblood or urine. If performed on blood, the test mayrequire one or two samples, depending on the physician’srequest. The first blood sample will be drawn after thepatient has been lying down in a warm, comfortableenvironment for at least 30 minutes. If a second sample isneeded, the patient will be asked to stand for 10 minutesbefore the blood is drawn. Instead of a venipuncture,which can be stressful for the patient, possibly increasingcatecholamine levels in the blood, a plastic or rubbertube-like device called a catheter may be used to collectthe blood samples. The catheter would be inserted in avein 24 hours in advance, eliminating the need for needlepunctures at the time of the test.\nIt may take up to a week for a lab to complete testing\nof the samples. Because blood levels of catecholaminescommonly go up and down in response to such factors astemperature, stress , postural change, diet, smoking ,obe-\nsity, and many drugs, abnormally high blood test results\nshould be confirmed with a 24-hour urine test. In addition,catecholamine secretion from a tumor may not be steady,but may occur periodically during the day, and potentiallycould be missed when blood testing is used. The urine testprovides the laboratory with a specimen that reflects cate-cholamine production over an entire 24-hour period. Ifurine is tested, the patient or a healthcare worker must col-lect all the urine passed over the 24-hour period.\nPreparation\nIt is important that the patient refrain from using cer-\ntain medications, especially cold or allergy remedies, fortwo weeks before the test. Certain foods—includingbananas, avocados, cheese, coffee, tea, cocoa, beer,licorice, citrus fruit, vanilla, and Chianti—must be avoid-ed for 48 hours prior to testing. However, people shouldbe sure to get adequate amounts of vitamin C before thetest, because this vitamin is necessary for catecholamineformation. The patient should be fasting (nothing to eat\nor drink) for 10 to 24 hours before the blood test andshould not smoke for 24 hours beforehand. Some labora-tories may call for additional restrictions. As much aspossible, the patient should try to avoid excessive physi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 677Catecholamines testsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 677cal exercise and emotional stress before the test, because\neither may alter test results by causing increased secre-tion of epinephrine and norepinephrine.\nPatients collecting their own 24-hour urine samples\nwill be given a container with special instructions. Theurine samples must be refrigerated.\nRisks\nRisks for the blood test are minimal, but may\ninclude slight bleeding from the venipuncture site, faint-\ningor feeling lightheaded after blood is drawn, or blood\naccumulating under the puncture site (hematoma). Thereare no risks for the urine test.\nNormal results\nReference ranges are laboratory-specific, vary accord-\ning to methodology of testing, and differ between bloodand urine samples. If testing is done by the method calledHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), typi-cal values for blood and urine follow.KEY TERMS\nDopamine —Dopamine is a precursor of epineph-\nrine and norepinephrine.\nEpinephrine —Epinephrine, also called adrenaline,\nis a naturally occurring hormone released by theadrenal glands in response to signals from the sym-pathetic nervous system. These signals are triggeredby stress, exercise, or by emotions such as fear.\nGanglioneuroma —A ganglioneuroma is a tumor\ncomposed of mature nerve cells.\nNeuroblastoma —Neuroblastoma is a tumor of the\nadrenal glands or sympathetic nervous system.Neuroblastomas can range from being relativelyharmless to highly malignant.\nNorepinephrine —Norepinephrine is a hormone\nsecreted by certain nerve endings of the sympa-thetic nervous system, and by the medulla (center)of the adrenal glands. Its primary function is tohelp maintain a constant blood pressure by stimu-lating certain blood vessels to constrict when theblood pressure falls below normal.\nPheochromocytoma —A pheochromocytoma is a\ntumor that originates from the adrenal gland’schromaffin cells, causing overproduction of cate-cholamines, powerful hormones that induce highblood pressure and other symptoms.Reference ranges for blood catecholamines\nSupine (lying down): Epinephrine less than 50\npg/mL, norepinephrine less than 410 pg/mL, anddopamine less than 90 pg/mL. Standing: Values for bloodspecimens taken when the subject is standing are higherthan the ranges for supine posture for norepinephrine andepinephrine, but not for dopamine.\nReference ranges for urine catecholamines\nEpinephrine 0–20 microgram per 24 hours; norepi-\nnephrine 15–80 microgram per 24 hours; dopamine65–400 microgram per 24 hours.\nAbnormal results\nDepending on the results, high catecholamine levels\ncan indicate different conditions and/or causes:\n• High catecholamine levels can help to verify pheochro-\nmocytoma, neuroblastoma , or ganglioneuroma. An aid\nto diagnosis is the fact that an adrenal medullary tumor(pheochromocytoma) secretes epinephrine, whereas gan-glioneuroma and neuroblastoma secrete norepinephrine.\n• Elevations are possible with, but do not directly confirm,\nthyroid disorders, low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ), or\nheart disease.\n• Electroshock therapy, or shock resulting from hemor-\nrhage or exposure to toxins, can raise catecholaminelevels.\n• In the patient with normal or low baseline cate-\ncholamine levels, failure to show an increase in thesample taken after standing suggests an autonomic ner-vous system dysfunction (the division of the nervoussystem responsible for the automatic or unconsciousregulation of internal body functioning).\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

Slight changes in the normal patternsof heartbeats often reset themselves without notice.\nBut when the heartbeat is greatly disrupted—either\nbecause of traumatic injury, disease, hypertension ,\nsurgery, or reduced blood flow to the heart caused byblockages in the blood vessels that nourish the heart—the condition must be recognized and treated immediate-ly. Otherwise, it can be fatal.\nVarious drugs can be used to control and help reset\nthese abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmias ). The tech-nique of catheter ablation (meaning tube-guided removal)\nis used to interrupt the abnormal contractions in the heart,allowing normal heart beating to resume. Atrial fibrilla-\ntion and flutter and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\nare two of the most common disorders treated withcatheter ablation.\nPrecautions\nThe improper correction of abnormal heartbeats can\ncause additional arrhythmias and can be fatal. Abnormali-ties in different areas of the heart cause different types ofirregular heartbeats; the type of arrhythmia must be clear-ly defined before this procedure can be properly done.\nDescription\nCatheter ablation involves delivering highly focused\nheat (or radio frequency energy) to specific areas of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 679Catheter ablation\nDuring catheter ablation, a long flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into a vein in the patient’s groin and guided towar d\nthe heart.

Radio frequency energy is very rapidly alternating\nelectrical current that is produced at the tip of thecatheter that is placed inside the heart. At the same timeas the catheter is inserted, a second electrode is placed onthe patient’s skin. When the catheter is energized, thebody conducts the energy from the catheter’s tip, throughthe heart and to the electrode on the skin’s surface, com-pleting the circuit.\nAlthough very little electricity is given off by the\ncatheter, the instrument does generate a large amount ofheat. This heat is absorbed by the heart tissue, causing asmall localized burn and destroying the tissue in contactwith the catheter tip; in this way, small regions of hearttissue are burned in a controlled manner. This controlleddestruction of small sections of heart muscle actuallykills the nerve cells causing the irregular heartbeat, stop-ping the nerve signals that are passing through this sec-tion of the heart. This usually causes the irregular heart-beat to be reset into a normal heartbeat.\nPreparation\nPeople can undergo this procedure by having gener-\nal anesthesia or by taking medicines to make themrelaxed and sleepy (sedatives) along with painkillers.Once the type of irregular heartbeat is identified andthese medicines are given, the catheter is insertedthrough a blood vessel and into the heart. Importantly,correct placement of the catheter is visualized by using aspecialized type of x-ray machine called a fluoroscope.\nAftercare\nBeing sure the patient is comfortable during and\nafter this procedure is very important. However, becauseeach person may have a different arrhythmia and possi-bly other medical problems as well, each patient’s needsmust be evaluated individually.KEY TERMS\nFluoroscope —A specialized x-ray machine used\nto visualize the placement of the catheter whenattempting to correct irregular heartbeats.\nPacemaker —An electrical device that has elec-\ntrodes attached to the heart to electrically stimu-late the heart to beat normally. Pacemakers can beinternal (placed under the skin) or external, withthe electrodes placed on the skin or threadedthrough a tube placed into the heart.Risks\nOverall, fewer than 5% of people having this proce-\ndure experience complications. The most common com-plications are usually related to blood vessel injury whenthe catheter is inserted and to different heart-relatedproblems due to the moving of the catheter within theheart. However, in general, this technique is safe and cancontrol many different heart arrhythmias.\nNormal results\nDepending upon the type of irregular heartbeat\nbeing treated, either the normal heartbeat resumes aftertreatment or the ability of the heart to beat on its own islost, requiring the insertion of a pacemaker to stimulatethe heart to beat regularly.\nAbnormal results\nAdditional irregular heartbeats can occur as a result\nof this procedure, as can damage to the blood vessels thatfeed the heart. Because this procedure requires the use ofthe x-ray machine called a fluoroscope, there is exposureto x-ray radiation, but it’s doubtful that this is harmful inadult patients.

    "title": "Celiac disease",
    "content": "Celiac disease\nDefinition\nCeliac disease is a disease of the digestive system\nthat damages the small intestine and interferes with theabsorption of nutrients from food.\nDescription\nCeliac disease occurs when the body reacts abnor-\nmally to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, andpossibly oats. When someone with celiac disease eatsfoods containing gluten, that person’s immune systemcauses an inflammatory response in the small intestine,which damages the tissues and results in impaired abilityto absorb nutrients from foods. The inflammation andmalabsorption create wide-ranging problems in manysystems of the body. Since the body’s own immune sys-tem causes the damage, celiac disease is classified as an“autoimmune” disorder. Celiac disease may also be calledsprue, nontropical sprue, gluten sensitive enteropathy,celiac sprue, and adult celiac disease.\nCeliac disease may be discovered at any age, from\ninfancy through adulthood. The disorder is more com-monly found among white Europeans or in people ofEuropean descent. It is very unusual to find celiac dis-ease in African or Asian people. The exact incidence ofthe disease is uncertain. Estimates vary from one in5000, to as many as one in every 300 individuals withthis background. The prevalence of celiac disease seemsto be different from one European country to another,and between Europe and the United States. This may bedue to differences in diet and/or unrecognized disease. Arecent study of random blood samples tested for celiacdisease in the US showed one in 250 testing positive. It isclearly underdiagnosed, probably due to the symptomsbeing attributed to another problem, or lack of knowl-edge about celiac disease by physicians and laboratories.Because of the known genetic component, relatives ofpatients with celiac disease are considered at higher riskfor the disorder.\nBecause celiac disease has a hereditary influence,\nclose relatives (especially first degree relatives, such aschildren, siblings, and parents) have a higher risk ofbeing affected with the condition. The chance that a firstdegree relative of someone with celiac disease will havethe disease is about 10%.\nAs more is learned about celiac disease, it becomes\nevident that it has many variations which may not pro-duce typical symptoms. It may even be clinically “silent,”where no obvious problems related to the disease areapparent.\nCauses and symptoms\nCeliac disease can run in families and has a genetic\nbasis, although the pattern of inheritance is complicated.The type of inheritance pattern that celiac disease fol-lows is called multifactorial (caused by many factors,both genetic and environmental). Researchers think thatseveral factors must exist in order for the disease tooccur. The patient must have a genetic predisposition todevelop the disorder. Then, something in their environ-ment acts as a stimulus, or “trigger,” to their immune sys-tem, causing the disease to become active for the firsttime. For conditions with multifactorial inheritance, peo-ple without the genetic predisposition are less likely todevelop the condition with exposure to the same triggers.Or, they may require more exposure to the stimulusbefore developing the disease than someone with agenetic predisposition. Some of the things which mayprovoke a reaction include surgery, especially gastroin-testinal surgery; a change to a low fat diet, which has anincreased number of wheat-based foods; pregnancy ;\nchildbirth ; severe emotional stress ; or a viral infection.\nThis combination of genetic susceptibility and an outsideagent leads to celiac disease.\nEach person with celiac disease is affected different-\nly. When food containing gluten reaches the small intes-tine, the immune system begins to attack a substancecalled gliadin, which is found in the gluten. The resultinginflammation causes damage to the delicate finger-likestructures in the intestine, called villi, where food absorp-tion actually takes place. The patient may experience anumber of symptoms related to the inflammation and thechemicals it releases, and/or the lack of ability to absorbnutrients from food, which can cause malnutrition .\nThe most commonly recognized symptoms of celiac\ndisease relate to the improper absorption of food in thegastrointestinal system. Many patients with gastrointesti-nal symptoms will have diarrhea and fatty, greasy,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 681Celiac diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 681unusually foul-smelling stools. The patient may com-\nplain of excessive gas (flatulence), distended abdomen,weight loss, and generalized weakness. Not all peoplehave digestive system complications; some people onlyhave irritability or depression. Irritability is one of themost common symptoms in children with celiac disease.\nNot all patients have these problems. Unrecognized\nand therefore untreated celiac disease may cause or con-tribute to a variety of other conditions. The decreasedability to digest, absorb, and utilize food properly (mal-absorption) may cause anemia (low red blood count )\nfrom iron deficiency or easy bruising from a lack of vita-min K. Poor mineral absorption may result in osteoporo-\nsis, or “brittle bones,” which may lead to bone fractures .\nVitamin D levels may be insufficient and bring about a“softening” of bones (osteomalacia), which producespain and bony deformities, such as flattening or bending.\nDefects in the tooth enamel, characteristic of celiac dis-ease, may be recognized by dentists. Celiac disease maybe discovered during medical tests performed to investi-gate failure to thrive in infants, or lack of proper growth\nin children and adolescents. People with celiac diseasemay also experience lactose intolerance because they\ndon’t produce enough of the enzyme lactase, whichbreaks down the sugar in milk into a form the body canabsorb. Other symptoms can include muscle cramps,fatigue , delayed growth, tingling or numbness in the legs\n(from nerve damage), pale sores in the mouth (calledaphthus ulcers), tooth discoloration, or missed menstrualperiods (due to severe weight loss).\nA distinctive, painful skin rash, called dermatitis\nherpetiformis, may be the first sign of celiac disease.Approximately 10% of patients with celiac disease havethis rash, but it is estimated that 85% or more of patientswith the rash have the disease.\nMany disorders are associated with celiac disease,\nthough the nature of the connection is unclear. One typeof epilepsy is linked to celiac disease. Once their celiacdisease is successfully treated, a significant number ofthese patients have fewer or no seizures. Patients withalopecia areata, a condition where hair loss occurs in\nsharply defined areas, have been shown to have a higherrisk of celiac disease than the general population. Thereappears to be a higher percentage of celiac diseaseamong people with Down syndrome , but the link\nbetween the conditions is unknown.\nSeveral conditions attributed to a disorder of the\nimmune system have been associated with celiac disease.People with insulin dependent diabetes (type I) have amuch higher incidence of celiac disease. One source esti-mates that as many as one in 20 insulin-dependent dia-betics may have celiac disease. Patients with other condi-tions where celiac disease may be more commonly foundinclude those with juvenile chronic arthritis, some thy-\nroid diseases, and IgA deficiency.\nThere is an increased risk of intestinal lymphoma, a\ntype of cancer , in individuals with celiac disease. Suc-\ncessful treatment of the celiac disease seems to decreasethe chance of developing lymphoma.\nDiagnosis\nBecause of the variety of ways celiac disease can\nmanifest itself, it is often not discovered promptly. Itssymptoms are similar to many other conditions includingirritible bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease ,ulcerative\ncolitis , diverticulosis, intestinal infections, chronic\nfatigue syndrome , and depression. The condition may\npersist without diagnosis for so long that the patientaccepts a general feeling of illness as normal. This leadsto further delay in identifying and treating the disorder. Itis not unusual for the disease to be identified in thecourse of medical investigations for seemingly unrelatedproblems. For example, celiac disease has been discov-ered during testing to find the cause of infertility .\nIf celiac disease is suspected, a blood test can be\nordered. This test looks for the antibodies to gluten (calledantigliadin, anti-endomysium, and antireticulin) that theimmune system produces in celiac disease. Antibodies arechemicals produced by the immune system in response tosubstances that the body perceives to be threatening. Someexperts advocate not just evaluating patients with symp-toms, but using these blood studies as a screening test forhigh-risk individuals, such as those with relatives (espe-cially first degree relatives) known to have the disorder. Anabnormal result points towards celiac disease, but furthertests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Because celiacdisease affects the ability of the body to absorb nutrientsfrom food, several tests may be ordered to look for nutri-tional deficiencies. For example, doctors may order a testof iron levels in the blood because low levels of iron (ane-mia) may accompany celiac disease. Doctors may alsoorder a test for fat in the stool, since celiac disease pre-vents the body from absorbing fat from food.\nIf these tests above are suspicious for celiac disease,\nthe next step is a biopsy (removal of a tiny piece of tissuesurgically) of the small intestine. This is usually done by agastroenterologist, a physician who specializes in diagnos-ing and treating bowel disorders. It is generally performedin the office, or in a hospital’s outpatient department. Thepatient remains awake, but is sedated. A narrow tube,called an endoscope, is passed through the mouth, downthrough the stomach, and into the small intestine. A smallsample of tissue is taken and sent to the laboratory foranalysis. If it shows a pattern of tissue damage characteris-tic of celiac disease, the diagnosis is established.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 682Celiac diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 682The patient is then placed on a gluten-free diet\n(GFD). The physician will periodically recheck the levelof antibody in the patient’s blood. After several months,the small intestine is biopsied again. If the diagnosis ofceliac disease was correct (and the patient followed therigorous diet), healing of the intestine will be apparent.Most experts agree that it is necessary to follow thesesteps in order to be sure of an accurate diagnosis.\nTreatment\nThe only treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free\ndiet. This may be easy for the doctor to prescribe, but dif-ficult for the patient to follow. For most people, adheringto this diet will stop symptoms and prevent damage to theintestines. Damaged villi can be functional again in threeto six months. This diet must be followed for life. Forpeople whose symptoms are cured by the gluten-free diet,this is further evidence that their diagnosis is correct.\nGluten is present in any product that contains wheat,\nrye, barley, or oats. It helps make bread rise, and givesmany foods a smooth, pleasing texture. In addition to themany obvious places gluten can be found in a normaldiet, such as breads, cereals, and pasta, there are manyhidden sources of gluten. These include ingredientsadded to foods to improve texture or enhance flavor andproducts used in food packaging. Gluten may even bepresent on surfaces used for food preparation or cooking.\nFresh foods that have not been artificially processed,\nsuch as fruits, vegetables, and meats, are permitted aspart of a GFD. Gluten-free foods can be found in healthfood stores and in some supermarkets. Mail-order foodcompanies often have a selection of gluten-free products.Help in dietary planning is available from dieticians(healthcare professionals specializing in food and nutri-\ntion) or from support groups for individuals with celiac\ndisease. There are many cookbooks on the market specif-ically for those on a GFD.\nTreating celiac disease with a GFD is almost always\ncompletely effective. Gastrointestinal complaints andother symptoms are alleviated. Secondary complications,such as anemia and osteoporosis, resolve in almost allpatients. People who have experienced lactose intoler-ance related to their celiac disease usually see thosesymptoms subside, as well. Although there is no risk andmuch potential benefit to this treatment, it is clear thatavoiding all foods containing gluten can be difficult.\nExperts emphasize the need for lifelong adherence to\nthe GFD to avoid the long-term complications of this dis-order. They point out that although the disease may havesymptom-free periods if the diet is not followed, silentdamage continues to occur. Celiac disease cannot be “out-grown” or cured, according to medical authorities.KEY TERMS\nAntibodies —Proteins that provoke the immune\nsystem to attack particular substances. In celiacdisease, the immune system makes antibodies to acomponent of gluten.\nGluten —A protein found in wheat, rye, barley,\nand oats.\nVilli—Tiny, finger-like projections that enable the\nsmall intestine to absorb nutrients from food.\nPrognosis\nPatients with celiac disease must adhere to a strict\nGFD throughout their lifetime. Once the diet has beenfollowed for several years, individuals with celiac dis-ease have similar mortality rates as the general popula-tion. However, about 10% of people with celiac diseasedevelop a cancer involving the gastrointestinal tract (bothcarcinoma and lymphoma).\nThere are a small number of patients who develop a\nrefractory type of celiac disease, where the GFD nolonger seems effective. Once the diet has been thorough-ly assessed to ensure no hidden sources of gluten arecausing the problem, medications may be prescribed.Steroids or immunosuppressant drugs are often used to\ntry to control the disease. It is unclear whether theseefforts meet with much success.\nPrevention\nThere is no way to prevent celiac disease. However,\nthe key to decreasing its impact on overall health is earlydiagnosis and strict adherence to the prescribed gluten-free diet.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLowell, Jax Peters.

    "title": "Cellulitis",
    "content": "Cellulitis\nDefinition\nCellulitis is a spreading bacterial infection just\nbelow the skin surface. It is most commonly caused byStreptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus .\nDescription\nThe word “cellulitis” actually means “inflammation\nof the cells.” Specifically, cellulitis refers to an infectionof the tissue just below the skin surface. In humans, theskin and the tissues under the skin are the most commonlocations for microbial infection. Skin is the first defenseagainst invading bacteria and other microbes. An infec-tion can occur when this normally strong barrier is dam-aged due to surgery, injury, or a burn. Even something assmall as a scratch or an insect bite allows bacteria to enterthe skin, which may lead to an infection. Usually, theimmune system kills any invading bacteria, but some-times the bacteria are able to grow and cause an infection.\nOnce past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and\nnutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. Disease-causingbacteria release proteins called enzymes which cause tis-sue damage. The body’s reaction to damage is inflamma-tion which is characterized by pain , redness, heat, and\nswelling. This red, painful region grows bigger as theinfection and resulting tissue damage spread. An untreat-ed infection may spread to the lymphatic system ( acute\nlymphangitis ), the lymph nodes ( lymphadenitis ), the\nbloodstream ( bacteremia ), or into deeper tissues. Celluli-\ntis most often occurs on the face, neck, and legs.Orbital cellulitis\nA very serious infection, called orbital cellulitis,\noccurs when bacteria enter and infect the tissues sur-rounding the eye. In 50–70% of all cases of orbital cel-lulitis, the infection spreads to the eye(s) from the sinus-es or the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat). Twen-ty-five percent of orbital infections occur after surgery onthe face. Other sources of orbital infection include adirect infection from an eye injury, from a dental orthroat infection, and through the bloodstream.\nInfection of the tissues surrounding the eye causes\nredness, swollen eyelids, severe pain, and causes the eyeto bulge out. This serious infection can lead to a tempo-rary loss of vision, blindness, brain abscesses, inflamma-tion of the brain and spinal tissues ( meningitis ), and\nother complications. Before the discovery of antibiotics ,\norbital cellulitis caused blindness in 20% of patients anddeath in 17% of patients. Antibiotic treatment has signif-\nicantly reduced the incidence of blindness and death.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough other kinds of bacteria can cause cellulitis,\nit is most often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (the\nbacteria which causes strep throat ) and Staphylococcus\naureus . Streptococcus pyogenes is the so-called “flesh-\neating bacteria” and, in rare cases, can cause a danger-ous, deep skin infection called necrotizing fasciitis.Orbital cellulitis may be caused by bacteria which cannotgrow in the presence of oxygen (anaerobic bacteria). Inchildren, Haemophilus influenzae type B frequently\ncauses orbital cellulitis following a sinus infection.\nStreptococcus pyogenes can be picked up from a\nperson who has strep throat or an infected sore. Othercellulitis-causing bacteria can be acquired from directcontact with infected sores. Persons who are at a higherrisk for cellulitis are those who have a severe underlyingdisease (such as cancer , diabetes, and kidney disease),\nare taking steroid medications, have a reduced immunesystem (because of AIDS , organ transplant, etc.), have\nbeen burned, have insect bites, have reduced blood circu-lation to limbs, or have had a leg vein removed for coro-nary bypass surgery. In addition, chicken pox, human oranimal bite wounds , skin wounds, and recent surgery\ncan put a person at a higher risk for cellulitis.\nThe characteristic symptoms of cellulitis are red-\nness, warmth, pain, and swelling. The infected areaappears as a red patch that gets larger rapidly within thefirst 24 hours. A thick red line which progresses towardsthe heart may appear indicating an infection of the lymphvessels (lymphangitis). Other symptoms which mayoccur include fever , chills, tiredness, muscle aches, and a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 684CellulitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 684general ill feeling. Some people also experience nausea,\nvomiting, stiff joints, and hair loss at the infection site.\nThe characteristic symptoms of orbital cellulitis are\neye pain, redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness. Theeye may bulge out and it may be difficult or impossibleto move. Temporary loss of vision, pus drainage from theeye, chills, fever, headaches, vomiting, and a general illfeeling may occur.\nDiagnosis\nCellulitis may be diagnosed and treated by a family\ndoctor, an infectious disease specialist, a doctor who spe-cializes in skin diseases (dermatologist), or in the case oforbital cellulitis, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). Thediagnosis of cellulitis is based mainly on the patient’ssymptoms. The patient’s recent medical history is alsoused in the diagnosis.\nLaboratory tests may be done to determine which\nkind of bacteria is causing the infection but these testsare not always successful. If the skin injury is visible, asterile cotton swab is used to pick up a sample from thewound. If there is no obvious skin injury, a needle maybe used to inject a small amount of sterile salt solutioninto the infected skin, and then the solution is withdrawn.The salt solution should pick up some of the bacteriacausing the infection. A blood sample may be taken fromthe patient’s arm to see if bacteria have entered thebloodstream. Also, a blood test may be done to count thenumber of white blood cells in the blood. High numbersof white blood cells suggest that the body is trying tofight a bacterial infection.\nFor orbital cellulitis, the doctor may often perform a\nspecial x-ray scan called computed tomography scan\n(CT). This scan enables the doctor to see the patient’shead in cross-section to determine exactly where theinfection is and see if any damage has occurred. A CTscan takes about 20 minutes.\nTreatment\nAntibiotic treatment is the only way to battle this\npotentially life-threatening infection. Mild to moderatecellulitis can be treated with the following antibioticstaken every four to eight hours by mouth:\n• penicillins (Bicillin, Wycillin, Pen Vee, V-Cillin)• erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab)\n• cephalexin (Biocef, Keflex)\n• cloxacillin (Tegopen)\nOther medications may be recommended, such as\nacetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\nto relieve pain, and aspirin to decrease fever.A normally healthy person is usually not hospital-\nized for mild or moderate cellulitis. General treatmentmeasures include elevation of the infected area, rest, andapplication of warm, moist compresses to the infectedarea. The doctor will want to see the patient again tomake sure that the antibiotic treatment is effective instopping the infection.\nPersons at high risk for severe cellulitis will proba-\nbly be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring. Antibi-otics may be given intravenously to patients with severecellulitis. Complications such as deep infection, or boneor joint infections, might require surgical drainage and alonger course of antibiotic treatment. Extensive tissuedestruction may require plastic surgery to repair. In casesof orbital cellulitis caused by a sinus infection, surgerymay be required to drain the sinuses.\nPrognosis\nOver 90% of all cellulitis cases are cured after seven to\n10 days of antibiotic treatment. Persons with serious dis-ease and/or those who are taking immunosuppressive drugsmay experience a more severe form of cellulitis which canbe life threatening. Serious complications include bloodpoisoning (bacteria growing in the blood stream), meningi-\ntis (brain and spinal cord infection), tissue death (necrosis),and/or lymphangitis (infection of the lymph vessels).Severe cellulitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes can\nlead to destructive and life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis.\nPrevention\nCellulitis may be prevented by wearing appropriate\nprotective equipment during work and sports to avoid\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 685Cellulitis\nThis person’s lower leg is swollen and inflamed due to cel-\nlulitis.

Further uses have\nshown positive results in the treatment of a wide range ofchronic conditions such as arteriosclerosis, congenitaldefects, and sexual dysfunction . The therapy has also\nbeen used to treat cancer patients at a number of clinics\nin Tijuana, Mexico, although this application has notbeen well supported with controlled clinical studies.\nDescription\nOrigins\nThe theory behind cell therapy has been in existence\nfor several hundred years. The first recorded discussion ofthe concept of cell therapy can be traced to PhillippusAureolus Paracelsus (1493–1541), a German-Swiss physi-cian and alchemist who wrote in his Der grossen Wun-\ndartzney (“Great Surgery Book”) in 1536 that “the heart\nheals the heart, lung heals the lung, spleen heals the spleen;like cures like.” Paracelsus and many of his contemporariesagreed that the best way to treat an illness was to use livingtissue to restore the ailing. In 1667, at a laboratory in thepalace of Louis XIV , Jean-Baptiste Denis (1640–1704)attempted to transfuse blood from a calf into a mentally illpatient—and since blood transfusion is, in effect, a form\nof cell therapy, this could be the first documented case ofthis procedure. However, the first recorded attempt at non-blood cellular therapy occurred in 1912 when Germanphysicians attempted to treat children with hypothy-\nroidism , or an underactive thyroid, with thyroid cells.\nIn 1931, Dr. Paul Niehans (1882–1971), a Swiss\nphysician, became known as “the father of cell therapy”quite by chance. After a surgical accident by a colleague,Niehans attempted to transplant a patient’s severely dam-aged parathyroid glands with those of a steer. When thepatient began to rapidly deteriorate before the transplantcould take place, Niehans decided to dice the steer’sparathyroid gland into fine pieces, mix the pieces in asaline solution, and inject them into the dying patient.Immediately, the patient began to improve and, in fact,lived for another 30 years.\nCell therapy is, in effect, a type of organ transplant\nwhich has also been referred to as “live cell therapy,”“xenotransplant therapy,” “cellular suspensions,” “glan-dular therapy,” or “fresh cell therapy.” The procedureinvolves the injection of either whole fetal xenogenic(animal) cells (e.g., from sheep, cows, pigs, and sharks)or cell extracts from human tissue. The latter is known asautologous cell therapy if the cells are extracted from andtransplanted back into the same patient. Several differenttypes of cells can be administered simultaneously.\nJust as Paracelsus’ theory of “like cures like,” the\ntypes of cells that are administered correspond in some\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 686Cell therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 686way with the organ or tissue in the patient that is failing.\nNo one knows exactly how cell therapy works, but pro-ponents claim that the injected cells travel to the similarorgan from which they were taken to revitalize and stim-ulate that organ’s function and regenerate its cellularstructure. In other words, the cells are not species specif-ic, but only organ specific. Supporters of cellular treat-ment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue con-tain active therapeutic agents distinct from vitamins ,\nminerals , hormones, or enzymes.\nSwedish researchers have successfully transplanted\nhuman fetal stem cells into human recipients, and theprocedure is being investigated further as a possibletreatment for repairing brain cells in Parkinson’spatients. However, because the cells used in these appli-cations must be harvested from aborted human fetuses,there is an ethical debate over their use.\nCurrently, applications of cell therapy in the United\nStates is still in the research, experimental, and clinicaltrial stages. The U.S. Food and Drug Administrationhas approved the use of one cellular therapy technique\nfor repairing damaged knee joints. The procedureinvolves removing healthy chondrocyte cells, the typeof cell that forms cartilage, from the patient, culturingthem in a laboratory for three to four weeks, and thentransplanting them back into the damaged knee joint ofthe patient.\nPreparations\nThere are several processes to prepare cells for use.\nOne form involves extracting cells from the patient theyare to be used on and then culturing them in a laboratorysetting until they multiply to the level needed for trans-plant back into the patient. Another procedure uses fresh-ly removed fetal animal tissue, which has been processedand suspended in a saline solution. The preparation offresh cells then may be either injected immediately intothe patient, or preserved by being freeze-dried or deep-frozen in liquid nitrogen before being injected. Cells maybe tested for pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or par-asites, before use.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 687Cell therapy\nPAUL NIEHANS (1882–1971)\nPaul Niehans was born and raised in Switzerland.\nHis father, a doctor, was dismayed when he entered theseminary, but Niehans quickly grew dissatisfied with reli-gious life and took up medicine after all. He first studiedat Bern, then completed an internship in Zurich.Niehans enlisted in the Swiss Army in 1912. When\nwar erupted in the Balkans, Niehans set up a hospital inBelgrade, Yugoslavia. The war provided him the opportu-nity to treat numerous patients, gaining a firsthand knowl-edge of the body and its workings.\nSince 1913, Niehans had been intrigued with Alexis\nCarrel’s experiments concerning the adaptive abilities ofcells, though Niehans himself specialized in glandulartransplants and by 1925 was one of the leading glandularsurgeons in Europe.\nNiehans referred to 1931 as the birth year of cellular\ntherapy. That year, he treated a patient suffering fromtetany whose parathyroid had been erroneously removedby another physician. Too weak for a glandular transplant,the patient was given injections of the parathyroid glandsof an ox, and she soon recovered. Niehans made moreinjections, even experimenting on himself, and reportedhe could cure illnesses through injections of live cellsextracted from healthy animal organs. He believedadding new tissue stimulated rejuvenation and recovery.\nNiehans treated Pope Pious XII with his injections\nand was nominated to the Vatican Academy of Sciencefollowing the pope’s recovery.\nNiehans remained a controversial figure throughout\nhis life. As of 2000, the Clinique Paul Niehans in Switzer-land, founded by his daughter, continues his work.\n(AP/Wide World Photos.

Some forms ofcell therapy use special coatings on the cells designed totrick the immune system into recognizing the new cellsas native to the body.\nThere is also the chance of the cell solution transmit-\nting bacterial or viral infection or other disease and para-sites to the patient. Careful screening and testing of cellsfor pathogens can reduce this risk.\nMany forms of cell therapy in the United States are\nstill largely experimental procedures. Patients shouldapproach these treatments with extreme caution, shouldinquire about their proven efficacy and legal use in theUnited States, and should only accept treatment from alicensed physician who should educate the patient com-pletely on the risks and possible side effects involvedwith cell therapy. These same cautions apply for patientsinterested in participating in clinical trials of cell therapytreatments.\nSide effects\nBecause cell therapy encompasses such a wide range\nof treatments and applications, and many of these treat-ments are still experimental, the full range of possibleside effects of the treatments are not yet known.

Inhigher doses, some CNS depressants may be used asgeneral anesthetics.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 688Central nervous system depressantsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 688Description\nThroughout history, humans have sought relief from\nanxiety and insomnia by using substances that depressbrain activity and induce a drowsy or calming effect. CNSdepressants include a wide range of drugs such as alcohol,narcotics, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal), ben-zodiazepines (Ativan, Halcion, Librium, Valium, Xanax),chloral hydrate, and methaqualone (Quaaludes), as well asnewer CNS depressants developed in the 1990s, such asBuspirone (Buspar) and Zolpidem (Ambien), which arethought to have the fewest sideeffects. Most CNS depres-sants activate a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobu-tyric acid (GABA), which helps decrease brain activity.Street names for CNS depressants include Reds, Yellows,Blues, Ludes, Barbs, and Downers.\nPrecautions\nMost CNS depressants have the potential to be physi-\ncally and psychologically addictive. Alcohol is the mostwidely abused depressant. The body tends to develop tol-erance for CNS depressants, and larger doses are neededto achieve the same effects. Withdrawal from some CNSdepressants can be uncomfortable; for example, with-drawal from a depressant treating insomnia or anxiety cancause rebound insomnia or anxiety as the brain’s activitybounces back after being suppressed. In some cases with-drawal can result in life-threatening seizures. Generally,depressant withdrawal should be undertaken under aphysician’s supervision. Many physicians will reduce thedepressant dosage gradually, to give the body time toadjust. Certain CNS depressants such as barbiturates areeasy to overdose on, since there is a relatively small dif-ference between the optimal dose and an overdose. Asmall miscalculation can lead to coma, slowed breathing,and death. CNS depressants should be administered toelderly individuals with care, as these individuals have areduced ability to metabolize CNS depressants.\nSide Effects\nEspecially when taken in excess, CNS depressants can\ncause confusion and dizziness, and impair judgment, mem-ory, intellectual performance, and motor coordination.\nInteractions\nCNS depressants should be used with other medica-\ntions, such as antidepressant medications, only under aphysician’s supervision. Certain herbal remedies, such asValerian and Kava, may dangerously exacerbate theeffects of certain CNS depressants. Also, ingesting a com-bination of CNS depressants, such Valium and alcohol,for example, is not advised.

Undersome circumstances, bacteria may enter areas of the CNS.If this occurs, abscesses or empyemas may be established.\nDescription\nIn general, the CNS is well defended against infec-\ntion. The spine and brain are sheathed in tough, protec-tive membranes. The outermost membrane, the duramater, and the next layer, the arachnoid, entirely encasethe brain and spinal cord. However, these defenses arenot absolute. In rare cases, bacteria gain access to areaswithin the CNS.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 689Central nervous system infectionsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 689Bacterial infection of the CNS can result in abscess-\nes and empyemas (accumulations of pus). Abscesseshave fixed boundaries, but empyemas lack definableshape and size. CNS infections are classified accordingto the location where they occur. For example, a spinalepidural abscess is located above the dura mater, and a\ncranial subdural empyema occurs between the dura\nmater and the arachnoid.\nAs pus and other material from an infection accumu-\nlate, pressure is exerted on the brain or spinal cord. Thispressure can damage the nervous system tissue, possiblypermanently. Without treatment, a CNS infection is fatal.\nCauses and symptoms\nTypically, bacterial invasion results from the spread\nof a nearby infection; for example, a chronic sinus ormiddle ear infection can extend beyond its initial site.Bacteria may also be conveyed to the CNS from distantsites of infection by the bloodstream. In rare cases, headtrauma or surgical procedures may introduce bacteriaKEY TERMS\nAbscess —A pus-filled area with definite borders.\nArachnoid —One of the membranes that sheathes\nthe spinal cord and brain; the arachnoid is the sec-ond-layer membrane.\nCerebrospinal fluid —Fluid that is normally found\nin the spinal cord and brain. Abnormal levels ofcertain molecules in this fluid can indicate thepresence of infection or damage to the central ner-vous system.\nCT scan (computed tomography) —Cross-sectional\nx rays of the body are compiled to create a three-dimensional image of the body’s internal structures.\nDura mater —One of the membranes that sheathes\nthe spinal cord and brain; the dura mater is theoutermost layer.\nEmpyema —A pus-filled area with indefinite borders.\nLumbar puncture —A procedure in which a nee-\ndle is inserted into the lower spine to collect asample of cerebrospinal fluid.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) —An imaging\ntechnique that uses a large circular magnet andradio waves to generate signals from atoms in thebody. These signals are used to construct images ofinternal structures.directly into the CNS. However, the source of infection\ncannot always be identified.\nSpecific symptoms of a CNS infection hinge on its\nexact location, but may include severe headache or back\npain , weakness, sensory loss, and a fever . An individual\nmay report a stiff neck, nausea or vomiting, and tirednessor disorientation. There is a potential for seizures, paral-\nysis, or coma .\nDiagnosis\nPhysical symptoms, such as a fever and intense\nbackache or a fever, severe headache, and stiff neck, raisethe suspicion of a CNS infection. Blood tests may indi-cate the presence of an infection but do not pinpoint itslocation. CT scans or MRI scans of the brain and spinecan provide definitive diagnosis, with an MRI scan beingthe most sensitive. A lumbar puncture and analysis of thecerebrospinal fluid can help diagnose an epiduralabscess; however, the procedure can be dangerous incases of subdural empyema.\nTreatment\nA two-pronged approach is taken to treat CNS infec-\ntions. First, antibiotic therapy against an array of potentialinfectious bacteria is begun. The second stage involvessurgery to drain the infected site. Although some CNSinfections have been resolved with antibiotics alone, the\nmore aggressive approach is often preferred. Surgery allowsimmediate relief of pressure on the brain or spinal cord, aswell as an opportunity to collect infectious material for bac-terial identification. Once the bacterial species is identified,drug therapy can be altered to a more specific antibiotic.However, surgery may not be an option in some cases, suchas when there are numerous sites of infection or when infec-tion is located in an inaccessible area of the brain.\nPrognosis\nThe fatality rate associated with CNS infections\nranges from 10% to as high as 40%. Some survivorsexperience permanent CNS damage, resulting in partialparalysis, speech problems, or seizures. Rapid diagnosisand treatment are essential for a good prognosis. Withprompt medical attention, an individual may recovercompletely.\nPrevention\nTreatment for pre-existing infections, such as sinus\nor middle ear infections, may prevent some cases of CNSinfection. However, since some CNS infections are ofunknown origin, not all are preventable.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 690Central nervous system infectionsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 690Resources\nBOOKS\nInfections of the Central Nervous System. 2nd ed.

Addition-\nally, methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetaminesulfate (Dexedrine) are used for their paradoxical effectin attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ).\nThe anerexiants, benzphetamine (Didrex), diethyl-\npropion (Tenuate), phendimetrazine (Bontril, Plegine),phentermine (Fastin, Ionamine), and sibutramine(Meridia) are CNS stimulants used for appetite reductionin severe obesity . Although these drugs are structurally\nsimilar to amphetamine, they cause less sensation ofstimulation, and are less suited for use in conditionscharacterized by lack of adrenergic stimulation.\nPhenylpropanolamine and ephedrine have been used\nboth as diet aids and as vasoconstrictors.\nDescription\nThe majority of CNS stimulants are chemically sim-\nilar to the neurohormone norepinephrine, and simulatethe traditional “fight or flight” syndrome associated withsympathetic nervous system arousal. Caffeine is more\nclosely related to the xanthines, such as theophylline. Asmall number of additional members of the CNS stimu-lant class do not fall into specific chemical groups.\nPrecautions\nAmphetamines have a high potential for abuse. They\nshould be used in weight reduction programs only whenalternative therapies have been ineffective. Administra-tion for prolonged periods ma y lead to drug dependence.\nThese drugs are classified as schedule II under federaldrug control regulations.\nThe amphetamines and their cogeners are con-\ntraindicated in advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomaticcardiovascular disease, and moderate to severe hyper-\ntension and hyperthyroidism . They should not be used\nto treat patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy tothe sympathomimetic amines, or with glaucoma , a histo-\nry of agitated states, a history of drug abuse, or duringthe 14 days following administration of monoamine oxi-dase (MAO) inhibitors.\nMethylphenidate may lower the seizure threshold.\nBenzphetamine is category X during pregnancy .\nDiethylpropion is category B. Other anorexiants have notbeen rated; however their use during pregnancy does notappear to be advisable. Safety for use of anorexiants hasnot been evaluated.\nAmphetamines are all category C during pregnancy.\nBreastfeeding while receiving amphetamines is not rec-ommended because the infant may experience withdraw-al symptoms.\nThere have been reports that when used in children,\nmethylphenidate and amphetamines may retard growth.Although these reports have been questioned, it may besuggested that the drugs not be administered outside ofschool hours (because most children have behavior prob-lems in school), in order to permit full stature to beattained.\nThe most common adverse effects of CNS stimulants\nare associated with their primary action. Typical respons-es include overstimulation, dizziness , restlessness, and\nsimilar reactions. Rarely, hematologic reactions, includ-ing leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and bone marrowdepression have been reported. Lowering of the seizurethreshold has been noted with most drugs in this class.\nWithdrawal syndrome\nAbrupt discontinuation following prolonged high\ndosage results in extreme fatigue , mental depression and\nchanges on the sleep EEG.

These medicines areavailable only with a physician’s prescription. They aresold in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\ncephalosporin. Check with the physician who prescribedthe drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription forthe correct dosage.\nAlways take cephalosporins exactly as directed by\nyour physician. Never take larger, smaller, more fre-quent, or less frequent doses. Take the drug for exactly aslong as directed—no more and no less. Do not save somedoses of the drug to take for future infections. The medi-cine may not be right for other kinds of infections, evenif the symptoms are the same. In addition, take all of themedicine to treat the infection for which it was pre-scribed. The infection may not clear up completely if toolittle medicine is taken. Taking this medicine for toolong, on the other hand, may open the door to new infec-tions that do not respond to the drug.\nSome cephalosporins work best when taken on an\nempty stomach. Others should be taken after meals.Check with the physician who prescribed the medicine orthe pharmacist who filled the prescription for instruc-tions on how to take the medicine.\nPrecautions\nCertain cephalosporins should not be combined with\nalcohol or with medicines that contain alcohol. Abdomi-nal or stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, facial flushing,and other symptoms may result within 15–30 minutesand may last for several hours. Do not drink alcoholicbeverages or use other medicines that contain alcoholwhile being treated with cephalosporins and for severaldays after treatment ends.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake cephalosporins. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:\nALLERGIES. Severe allergic reactions to this medicine\nmay occur. Anyone who is allergic to cephalosporins ofany kind should not take other cephalosporins. Anyonewho is allergic to penicillin should check with a physicianbefore taking any cephalosporin.

    "title": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy",
    "content": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy\nDefinition\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is also known\nas congophilic angiopathy or cerebrovascular amyloido-\nsis. It is a disease of small blood vessels in the brain in\nwhich deposits of amyloid protein in the vessel wallsmay lead to stroke , brain hemorrhage, or dementia .\nAmyloid protein resembles a starch and is deposited intissues during the course of certain chronic diseases.\nDescription\nCAA may affect patients over age 45, but is most com-\nmon in patients over age 65, and becomes more commonwith increasing age. Men and women are equally affected.In some cases, CAA is sporadic but it may also be inheritedas an autosomal dominant condition (a form of inheritancein which only one copy of a gene coding for a disease needbe present for that disease to be expressed; if either parenthas the disease, a child has a 50% chance of inheriting thedisease). CAA is responsible for 5–20% of brain hemor-rhages and up to 30% of lobar hemorrhages localized to onelobe of the brain. CAA may be found during an autopsy in\nover one-third of persons over age 60, even though theymay not have had brain hemorrhage, stroke, or other mani-festations of the disease during life. In Alzheimer’s disease ,\nCAA is more common than in the general population, andmay occur in more than 80% of patients over age 60.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of amyloid deposits in blood vessels in the\nbrain in sporadic CAA is not known. In hereditary CAA,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 694Cerebral amyloid angiopathyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 694genetic defects, typically on chromosome 21, allow accu-\nmulation of amyloid, a protein made up of units calledbeta-pleated sheet fibrils. The fibrils tend to clump togeth-er, so that the amyloid cannot be dissolved and builds upin the brain blood vessel walls. One form of amyloid fibrilsubunit proteins is the amyloid beta protein.\nDifferent theories have been suggested for the\nsource of amyloid beta protein in the brain. The systemictheory suggests that amyloid beta protein in the bloodstream is deposited in blood vessels in the brain, causingweakness in the blood vessel wall and breakdown in theblood-brain barrier. Normally, the blood-brain barrierkeeps proteins and other large molecules from escapingfrom the blood vessel to the brain tissue. When there isbreakdown of the blood-brain barrier, amyloid beta pro-tein leaks through the blood vessel wall, and is depositedin the brain substance, where it forms an abnormal struc-ture called a neuritic plaque.\nA second, more likely theory is that amyloid fibrils\nthat form amyloid beta protein are produced by perivas-cular microglia, or support cells in contact with the brainblood vessel wall. The third theory is that the brain tissuegives rise to amyloid beta protein. Both the nerve cellsand the glia are known to produce amyloid precursorprotein, which increases with aging and with cell stress .\nBleeding into the brain may occur as tiny blood ves-\nsels carrying amyloid deposits become heavier and morebrittle, and are therefore more likely to burst with minortrauma or with fluctuating blood pressure. Aneurysms, orballooning of the blood vessel wall, may develop, andmay also rupture as the stretched wall becomes thinnerand is under more pressure. Amyloid deposits maydestroy smooth muscle cells or cause inflammation in theblood vessel wall. This may also cause the blood vesselto break more easily.\nThe most common form of CAA is the sporadic\nform associated with aging. This type of CAA usuallycauses lobar hemorrhage, which may recur in differentlobes of the brain. The frontal lobe (behind the forehead)and parietal lobe (behind the frontal lobe) are most oftenaffected; the temporal lobe (near the temple) and occipi-tal lobe (at the back of the brain) are affected less often;and the cerebellum (under the occipital lobe) is rarelyaffected. Approximately 10–50% of hemorrhages in spo-radic CAA involve more than one lobe.\nSymptoms of lobar hemorrhage in CAA include\nsudden onset of headache , neurologic symptoms such as\nweakness, sensory loss, visual changes, or speech prob-lems, depending on which lobe is involved; anddecreased level of consciousness (a patient who is diffi-cult to arouse), nausea, and vomiting.

Over40% of patients with hemorrhage secondary to CAA alsohave dementia.\nGenetic factors play a role in certain types of CAA\nand in diseases associated with CAA:\n• Dutch type of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with\namyloidosis (build up of amyloid protein in blood ves-sels): autosomal dominant, with a genetic mutationinvolving the amyloid precursor protein.

Symptomsinclude brain hemorrhage or dementia.\n• Familial Alzheimer’s disease: autosomal dominant,\ncomprising 5–10% of all Alzheimer’s disease cases (abrain disease in which death of nerve cells leads to pro-\ngressive dementia).\n•Down Syndrome : caused by trisomy 21 (three rather\nthan two copies of chromosome 21), causing excessamyloid precursor protein gene. Children with Downsyndrome are mentally handicapped and may haveheart problems.\n• Icelandic type of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with\namyloidosis: autosomal dominant, with mutation in thegene coding for cystatin C. Symptoms often begin atage 30–40 with multiple brain hemorrhages, dementia,paralysis (weakness), and death in 10–20 years.\nHeadache occurs in more than half of patients, andseizures occur in one-quarter. Unlike most other formsof CAA, most hemorrhages involve the basal gangliadeep within the brain (Basal ganglia are islands of tis-sues in the cerebellum part of the brain.).\n• Familial oculo-leptomeningeal amyloidosis: autosomal\ndominant with unknown gene defect(s), described inJapanese, Italian, and North American families. Symp-toms can include dementia, ataxia (problems with coor-dination), spasticity (limb stiffness), strokes, seizures,peripheral neuropathy (disease affecting the nerves\nsupplying the limbs), migraine, spinal cord problems,blindness, and deafness. Brain hemorrhage is rare asthe amyloid protein is deposited in blood vessels in theeye and meninges (brain coverings), but not in the brainitself. In Italian families with the disease, patients maybe affected as early as 20–30 years of age.\n• British type of familial amyloidosis: autosomal domi-\nnant with unknown gene defect(s), associated with pro-gressive dementia, spasticity, and ataxia. Brain stem,spinal cord, and cerebellum all exhibit amyloid deposits,but hemorrhage typically does not occur.\nDiagnosis\nAs in most neurologic diseases, diagnosis is made\nmost often from the patient’s history, with careful inquiryinto family history and the patient’s onset and pattern ofsymptoms, as well as neurologic examination. Braincomputed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) may identify lobar hemorrhage,\nstroke, or petechial hemorrhages, and are important inexcluding arteriovenous malformation, brain tumor ,o r\nother causes of hemorrhage. Angiography (x-ray study\nof the interior of blood vessels and the heart) is not help-ful in diagnosis of CAA, but may be needed to excludeaneurysm. Brain biopsy (surgical removal of a small\npiece of brain tissue) may show characteristic amyloiddeposits, but is rarely performed, as the risk may not bejustifiable in the absence of effective treatment for CAA.If diagnosis is uncertain, biopsy may be needed to ruleout conditions which are potentially treatable. Definitediagnosis requires microscopic examination of brain tis-sue, either at biopsy, at autopsy, or at surgery when brainhemorrhage is drained. Lumbar puncture to examinecerebrospinal fluid proteins may show characteristicabnormalities, but is not part of the routine exam. Infamilial forms, genetic analysis may be helpful.\nCAA with hemorrhage must be distinguished from\nother types of brain hemorrhage. In CAA, hemorrhagetypically occurs in the lobar region, often ruptures into thesubarachnoid space between the brain and its coverings,and occurs at night. In hemorrhage related to high bloodpressure, hemorrhage is usually deeper within the brain,ruptures into the ventricles or cavities deep inside thebrain, and occurs during daytime activities. Other causesof brain hemorrhage are arteriovenous malformations ,\ntrauma, aneurysms, bleeding into a brain tumor, vasculi-\ntis(inflammation of blood vessels), or bleeding disorders.\nTreatment\nAlthough there is no effective treatment for the under-\nlying disease process of CAA, measures can be taken toprevent brain hemorrhage in patients diagnosed with CAA.High blood pressure should be treated aggressively, andeven normal blood pressure can be lowered as much as tol-erated without side effects from medications. Blood thin-ners such as Coumadin, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin ,\nor medications designed to dissolve blood clots may causehemorrhage in patients with CAA, and should be avoided ifpossible. If these medications are required for other condi-tions, such as heart disease, the potential benefits must becarefully weighed against the increased risks.\nSeizures, or recurrent neurologic symptoms thought\nto be seizures, should be treated with anti-epilepticdrugs, although Depakote (sodium valproate) should beavoided because of its antiplatelet effect. Anti-epilepticdrugs are sometimes given to patients with large lobarhemorrhage in an attempt to prevent seizures, althoughthe benefit of this is unclear.\nOnce brain hemorrhage has occurred, the patient\nshould be admitted to a hospital (ICU) for neurologicmonitoring and control of increased pressure within thebrain, blood pressure control, and supportive medical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 696Cerebral amyloid angiopathyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 696care. Antiplatelet agents and blood thinners should be dis-\ncontinued and their effects reversed, if possible. Surgerymay be needed to remove brain hemorrhage, althoughbleeding during surgery may be difficult to control.\nCAA may be rarely associated with cerebral vasculitis,\nor inflammation of the blood vessel walls. In these casestreatment with steroids or immune system suppressantsmay be helpful. Without tissue examination, vasculitis can-not be diagnosed reliably, and probably coexists with CAAtoo rarely to justify steroid treatment in most cases.\nPrognosis\nSince CAA is associated with progressive blood ves-\nsel degeneration, and since there is no effective treat-ment, most patients have a poor prognosis. Aggressiveneurosurgical management allows increased survival fol-lowing lobar hemorrhage, but as of 1998, 20–90% ofpatients die from the first hemorrhage or its complica-tions, which include progression of hemorrhage, brainedema (swelling) with herniation (downward pressure\non vital brain structures), seizures, and infections such aspneumonia . Many survivors have persistent neurologic\ndeficits related to the brain lobe affected by hemorrhage,and are at risk for additional hemorrhages, seizures, anddementia. Prognosis is worse in patients who are older,or who have larger hemorrhages or recurrent hemor-rhages within a short time.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nBornebroek, M., et.al. “White Matter Lesions and Cognitive\nDeterioration in Presymptomatic Carriers of the AmyloidPrecursor Protein Gene Codon 693 Mutation.” Archives of\nNeurology 53, no. 1 (1996): 43-48.\nItoh, Y ., et.al. “Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: a Significant\nCause of Cerebellar as well as Lobar Cerebral Hemor-rhage in the Elderly.” Journal of Neurological Sciences\n116, no. 2 (1993):135-41.\nNeau, J.

    "title": "Cerebral aneurysm",
    "content": "Cerebral aneurysm\nDefinition\nA cerebral aneurysm occurs at a weak point in the\nwall of a blood vessel (artery) that supplies blood to thebrain. Because of the flaw, the artery wall bulges outwardand fills with blood. This bulge is called an aneurysm. Ananeurysm can rupture, spilling blood into the surround-ing body tissue. A ruptured cerebral aneurysm can causepermanent brain damage, disability, or death .\nDescription\nA cerebral aneurysm can occur anywhere in the brain.\nAneurysms can have several shapes. The saccularaneurysm, once called a berry aneurysm, resembles a pieceof fruit dangling from a branch. Saccular aneurysms areusually found at a branch in the blood vessel where theyballoon out by a thin neck. Saccular cerebral aneurysmsmost often occur at the branch points of large arteries at thebase of the brain. Aneurysms may also take the form of abulge in one wall of the artery—a lateral aneurysm—or awidening of the entire artery—a fusiform aneurysm.\nThe greatest danger of aneurysms is rupture.\nApproximately 50–75% of stricken people survive ananeurysmal rupture. A ruptured aneurysm spills bloodinto the brain or into the fluid-filled area that surroundsthe brain tissue. Bleeding into this area, called the sub-arachnoid space, is referred to as subarachnoid hemor-\nrhage (SAH). About 25,000 people suffer a SAH each\nyear. It is estimated that people with unrupturedaneurysm have an annual 1–2% risk of hemorrhage.Under age 40, more men experience SAH. After age 40,more women than men are affected.\nMost people who have suffered a SAH from a rup-\ntured aneurysm did not know that the aneurysm evenexisted. Based on autopsy studies, medical researchers\nestimate that 1–5% of the population has some type ofcerebral aneurysm. Aneurysms rarely occur in the veryyoung or the very old; about 60% of aneurysms are diag-nosed in people between ages 40 and 65.\nSome aneurysms may have a genetic link and run in\nfamilies. The genetic link has not been completelyproven and a pattern of inheritance has not been deter-mined. Some studies seem to show that first-degree rela-tives of people who suffered aneurysmal SAH are morelikely to have aneurysms themselves. These studiesreported that such immediate family members were fourtimes more likely to have aneurysms than the generalpopulation. Other studies do not confirm these findings.Better evidence links aneurysms to certain rare diseasesof the connective tissue. These diseases include Marfan\nsyndrome ,pseudoxanthoma elasticum ,Ehlers-Danlos\nsyndrome , and fibromuscular dysplasia. Polycystic kid-\nney disease is also associated with cerebral aneurysms.\nThese diseases are also associated with an increased\nrisk of aneurysmal rupture. Certain other conditions raise\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 697Cerebral aneurysmGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 697the risk of rupture, too. Most aneurysms that rupture are\na half-inch or larger in diameter. Size is not the only fac-tor, however, because smaller aneurysms also rupture.Cigarette smoking , excessive alcohol consumption, and\nrecreational drug use (for example, use of cocaine ) have\nbeen linked with an increased risk. The role, if any, ofhigh blood pressure has not been determined. Some stud-ies have implicated high blood pressure in aneurysm for-mation and rupture, but people with normal blood pres-sure also experience aneurysms and SAHs. High bloodpressure may be a risk factor but not the most importantone. Pregnancy , labor, and delivery also seem to\nincrease the possibility that an aneurysm might rupture,but not all doctors agree. Physical exertion and use oforal contraceptives are not suspected causes for aneurys-mal rupture.\nCauses and symptoms\nCerebral aneurysms can be caused by brain trauma,\ninfection, hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ), or\nabnormal rapid cell growth (neoplastic disease), but mostseem to arise from a congenital, or developmental,defect. These congenital aneurysms occur more frequent-ly in women. Whatever the cause may be, the inner wall\nof the blood vessel is abnormally thin and the pressure ofthe blood flow causes an aneurysm to form.\nMost aneurysms go unnoticed until they rupture.\nHowever, 10–15% of unruptured cerebral aneurysms arefound because of their size or their location. Commonwarning signs include symptoms that affect only one eye,such as an enlarged pupil, a drooping eyelid, or pain\nabove or behind the eye. Other symptoms are a localizedheadache , unsteady gait, a temporary problem with\nsight, double vision, or numbness in the face.\nSome aneurysms bleed occasionally without rupturing.\nSymptoms of such an aneurysm develop gradually. Thesymptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, neck pain,black-outs, ringing in the ears, dizziness , or seeing spots.\nEighty to ninety percent of aneurysms are not diag-\nnosed until after they have ruptured. Rupture is notalways a sudden event. Nearly 50% of patients who haveaneurysmal SAHs also experience “the warning leakphenomenon.” Persons with warning leak symptomshave sudden, atypical headaches that occur days orweeks before the actual rupture. These headaches are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 698Cerebral aneurysm\nThree aneurysms can be seen in this section of a cerebral artery removed from a human brain.

Nausea, vomiting, and\ndizziness may accompany sentinel headaches. Unfortu-nately, these symptoms can be confused with tensionheadaches or migraines, and treatment can be delayeduntil rupture occurs.\nWhen an aneurysm ruptures, most victims experi-\nence a sudden, extremely severe headache. Thisheadache is typically described as the worst headache ofthe victim’s life. Nausea and vomiting commonly\naccompany the headache. The person may experience ashort loss of consciousness or prolonged coma . Other\ncommon signs of a SAH include a stiff neck, fever , and a\nsensitivity to light. About 25% of victims experienceneurological problems linked to specific areas of thebrain, swelling of the brain due to fluid accumulation(hydrocephalus ), or seizure.\nDiagnosis\nBased on the clinical symptoms, a doctor will run\nseveral tests to confirm an aneurysm or an SAH. A com-\nputed tomography (CT) scan of the head is the initial\nprocedure. A magnetic resonance imaging test (MRI)\nmay be done instead of a CT scan. MRI, however, is notas sensitive as CT for detecting subarachnoid blood. ACT scan can determine whether there has been a hemor-rhage and can assist in pinpointing the location of theaneurysm. The scan is most useful when it is done withinKEY TERMS\nCongenital —Existing at birth.\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome —A rare inheritable dis-\nease of the connective tissue marked by very elasticskin, very loose joints, and very fragile body tissue.\nEmbolization —A technique to stop or prevent hem-\norrhage by introducing a foreign mass, such as anair-filled membrane (balloon), into a blood vessel toblock the flow of blood.\nFibromuscular dysplasia —A disorder that causes\nunexplained narrowing of arteries and high bloodpressure.\nMagnetic resonance angiography —A noninvasive\ndiagnostic technique that uses radio waves to mapthe internal anatomy of the blood vessels.\nMarfan syndrome —An inheritable disorder that\naffects the skeleton, joints, and blood vessels.

Later scans may miss the signs\nof hemorrhage.\nIf the CT scan is negative for a hemorrhage or pro-\nvides an unclear diagnosis, the doctor will order a cere-\nbrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis , also called a lumbar\npuncture. In this procedure, a small amount of cere-brospinal fluid is removed from the lower back andexamined for traces of blood and blood-breakdown prod-ucts. If this test is positive, cerebral angiography is used\nto map the brain’s blood vessels and the damaged area.The angiography is done to pinpoint the aneurysm’slocation. About 15% of people who experience SAHhave more than one aneurysm. For this reason, angiogra-phy should include both the common carotid artery thatfeeds the front of the brain and the vertebral artery thatfeeds the base of the brain. Occasionally, the angiogra-phy fails to find the aneurysm and must be repeated. Ifseizures occur, electroencephalography (EEG) may be\nused to measure the electrical activity of the brain.\nTreatment\nUnruptured aneurysm\nIf an aneurysm has not ruptured and is not causing\nany symptoms, it may be left untreated. Because there isa 1–2% chance of rupture per year, the cumulative riskover a number of years may justify surgical treatment.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 699Cerebral aneurysmGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 699However, if the aneurysm is small or in a place that\nwould be difficult to reach, or if the person who has theaneurysm is in poor health, the surgical treatment may bea greater risk than the aneurysm. Risk of rupture is high-er for people who have more than one aneurysm. Unrup-tured aneurysm would probably be treated with a surgi-cal procedure called the clip ligation, as described below.\nRuptured aneurysm\nThe primary treatment for a ruptured aneurysm\ninvolves stabilizing the victim’s condition, treating theimmediate symptoms, and promptly assessing furthertreatment options, especially surgical procedures. Thepatient may require mechanical ventilation, oxygen, andfluids. Medications may be given to prevent major sec-ondary complications such as seizures, rebleeding, andvasospasm (narrowing of the affected blood vessel).Vasospasm decreases blood flow to the brain and causesthe death of nerve cells. A drug such as nimodipine(Nimotop) may help prevent vasospasm by relaxing thesmooth muscle tissue of the arteries. Even with treat-ment, however, vasospasm may cause stroke or death.\nTo prevent further hemorrhage from the aneurysm, it\nmust be removed from circulation. In general, surgicalprocedures should be performed as soon as possible toprevent rebleeding. The chances that aneurysm willrebleed are greatest in the first 24 hours, and vasospasmusually does not occur until 72 hours or more after rup-ture. If the patient is in poor condition or if there isvasospasm or other complication, surgical proceduresmay be delayed. The preferred surgical method is a clipligation in which a clip is placed around the base of theaneurysm to block it off from circulation. Surgical coat-ing, wrapping, or trapping of the aneurysm may also beperformed. These procedures do not completely removethe aneurysm from circulation, however, and there issome risk that it may rebleed in the future. Newer tech-niques that look promising include balloon embolization,a procedure that blocks the aneurysm with an inflatablemembrane introduced by means of a catheter insertedthrough the artery.\nPrognosis\nAn unruptured aneurysm may not cause any symp-\ntoms over an entire lifetime. Surgical clip ligation willensure that it won’t rupture, but it may be better to leavethe aneurysm alone in some cases. Familial cerebralaneurysms may rupture earlier than those without agenetic link.\nThe outlook is not as good for a person who suffers a\nruptured aneurysm. Fifteen to twenty-five percent ofpeople who experience a ruptured aneurysm do not sur-vive. An additional 25–50% die as a result of complica-\ntions associated with the hemorrhage. Of the survivors,15–50% suffer permanent brain damage and disability.These conditions are caused by the death of nerve cells.Nerve cells can be destroyed by the hemorrhage itself orby complications from the hemorrhage, such asvasospasm or hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus, a dilata-tion (expansion) of the fluid-filled cavity surrounding thebrain, occurs in about 15% of cases. Immediate medicaltreatment is vital to prevent further complications andbrain damage in those who survive the initial rupture.Patients who survive SAH and aneurysm clipping areunlikely to die from events related to SAH.\nPrevention\nThere are no known methods to prevent an aneurysm\nfrom forming. If an aneurysm is discovered before it rup-tures, it may be surgically removed. CT or MRI angiogra-phy may be recommended for relatives of patients withfamilial cerebral aneurysms.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSmith, Robert R., Yahgoub Tarassoli, and Yuri Zubkov.

CP is caused by eventsbefore, during, or after birth. The abnormalities of mus-cle control that define CP are often accompanied byother neurological and physical abnormalities.\nDescription\nV oluntary movement (walking, grasping, chewing,\netc.) is primarily accomplished using muscles that areattached to bones, known as the skeletal muscles. Controlof the skeletal muscles originates in the cerebral cortex,the largest portion of the brain. Palsy means paralysis ,\nbut may also be used to describe uncontrolled musclemovement. Therefore, cerebral palsy encompasses anydisorder of abnormal movement and paralysis caused byabnormal function of the cerebral cortex. In truth, howev-er, CP does not include conditions due to progressive dis-ease or degeneration of the brain. For this reason, CP isalso referred to as static (nonprogressive) encephalopathy(disease of the brain). Also excluded from CP are any dis-orders of muscle control that arise in the muscles them-selves and/or in the peripheral nervous system (nervesoutside the brain and spinal cord).\nCP is not a specific diagnosis, but is more accurately\nconsidered a description—a description of a broad butdefined group of neurological and physical problems.\nThe symptoms of CP and their severity are quite\nvariable. Those with CP may have only minor difficultywith fine motor skills, such as grasping and manipulatingitems with their hands. A severe form of CP couldinvolve significant muscle problems in all four limbs,mental retardation , seizures, and difficulties with\nvision, speech, and hearing.\nMuscles that receive defective messages from the\nbrain may be constantly contracted and tight (spastic),exhibit involuntary writhing movements (athetosis), orhave difficulty with voluntary movement (dyskinesia).There can also be a lack of balance and coordination withunsteady movements (ataxia). A combination of any ofthese problems may also occur. Spastic CP and mixedCP constitute the majority of cases. Effects on the mus-cles can range from mild weakness or partial paralysis(paresis), to complete loss of voluntary control of a mus-cle or group of muscles (plegia). CP is also designated bythe number of limbs affected. For instance, affected mus-cles in one limb is monoplegia, both arms or both legs isdiplegia, both limbs on one side of the body is hemiple-gia, and in all four limbs is quadriplegia. Muscles of thetrunk, neck, and head may be affected as well.\nCP can be caused by a number of different mecha-\nnisms at various times—from several weeks after concep-tion, through birth, to early childhood. For many years, itwas accepted that most cases of CP were due to braininjuries received during a traumatic birth, known as birthasphyxia. However, extensive research in the 1980sshowed that only 5–10% of CP can be attributed to birthtrauma. Other possible causes include abnormal develop-ment of the brain, prenatal factors that directly or indirectlydamage neurons in the developing brain, premature birth,and brain injuries that occur in the first few years of life.\nAdvances in the medical care of premature infants in\nthe last 20 years have dramatically increased the rate ofsurvival of these fragile newborns. However, as gesta-tional age at delivery and birth weight of a babydecrease, the risk for CP dramatically increases. A termpregnancy is delivered at 37–41 weeks gestation. The\nrisk for CP in a preterm infant (32–37 weeks) isincreased about five-fold over the risk for an infant bornat term. Survivors of extremely preterm births (less than28 weeks) face as much as a 50-fold increase in risk.About 50% of all cases of CP now being diagnosed are inchildren who were born prematurely.\nTwo factors are involved in the risk for CP associat-\ned with prematurity . First, premature babies are at high-\ner risk for various CP-associated medical complications,such as intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, and difficul-ty in breathing, to name a few. Second, the onset of pre-\nmature labor may be induced, in part, by complications\nthat have already caused neurologic damage in the fetus.A combination of both factors almost certainly plays arole in some cases of CP. The tendency toward prematuredelivery runs in families, but the genetic mechanisms arefar from clear.\nAn increase in multiple pregnancies in recent years,\nespecially in the United States, is blamed on theincreased use of fertility drugs. As the number of fetusesin a pregnancy increases, the risks for abnormal develop-ment and premature delivery also increase. Childrenfrom twin pregnancies have four times the risk of devel-oping CP as children from singleton pregnancies, owingto the fact that more twin pregnancies are delivered pre-maturely. The risk for CP in a child of triplets is up to 18times greater. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests thata baby from a pregnancy in which its twin died beforebirth is at increased risk for CP.\nApproximately 500,000 children and adults in the\nUnited States have CP, and it is newly diagnosed in about6,000 infants and young children each year. The inci-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 701Cerebral palsyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 701dence of CP has not changed much in the last 20–30\nyears. Ironically, advances in medicine have decreasedthe incidence from some causes, Rh disease for example,but increased it from others, notably, prematurity andmultiple pregnancies. No particular ethnic groups seemto be at higher risk for CP. However, people of disadvan-taged background are at higher risk due to poorer accessto proper prenatal care and advanced medical services.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs noted, CP has many causes, making a discussion\nof the genetics of CP complicated. A number of heredi-tary/genetic syndromes have signs and symptoms similarto CP, but usually also have problems not typical of CP.Put another way, some hereditary conditions “mimic”CP. Isolated CP, meaning CP that is not a part of someother syndrome or disorder, is usually not inherited.\nIt might be possible to group the causes of CP into\nthose that are genetic and those that are non-genetic, butmost would fall somewhere in between. Grouping causesinto those that occur during pregnancy (prenatal), thosethat happen around the time of birth (perinatal), and thosethat occur after birth (postnatal), is preferable. CP relatedto premature birth and multiple pregnancies (twins,triplets, etc., not “many pregnancies”) is somewhat differ-ent and considered separately.\nPrenatal causes\nAlthough much has been learned about human\nembryology in the last couple of decades, a great dealremains unknown. Studying prenatal human develop-ment is difficult because the embryo and fetus develop ina closed environment—the mother’s womb. However,the relatively recent development of a number of prenataltests has opened a window on the process. Add to thatmore accurate and complete evaluations of newborns,especially those with problems, and a clearer picture ofwhat can go wrong before birth is possible.\nThe complicated process of brain development before\nbirth is susceptible to many chance errors that can result inabnormalities of varying degrees. Some of these errorswill result in structural anomalies of the brain, while oth-ers may cause undetectable, but significant, abnormalitiesin how the cerebral cortex is “wired.” An abnormality instructure or wiring is sometimes hereditary, but is mostoften due to chance, or a cause unknown at this time.Whether and how much genetics played a role in a particu-lar brain abnormality depends to some degree on the typeof anomaly and the form of CP it causes.\nSeveral maternal-fetal infections are known to\nincrease the risk for CP, including rubella (Germanmeasles , now rare in the United States), cytomegalovirus\n(CMV), and toxoplasmosis . Each of these infections is\nconsidered a risk to the fetus only if the mother contractsit for the first time during that pregnancy. Even in thosecases, though, most babies will be born normal. Mostwomen are immune to all three infections by the timethey reach childbearing age, but a woman’s immune sta-tus can be determined using the so-called TORCH (forToxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes)test before or during pregnancy.\nJust as a stroke can cause neurologic damage in an\nadult, so too can this type of event occur in the fetus. Aburst blood vessel in the brain followed by uncontrolledbleeding (coagulopathy), known as intracerebral hemor-rhage, could cause a fetal stroke, or a cerebral blood ves-sel could be obstructed by a clot ( embolism ). Infants who\nlater develop CP, along with their mothers, are more like-ly than other mother-infant pairs to test positive for fac-tors that put them at increased risk for bleeding episodesor blood clots. Some coagulation disorders are strictly\nhereditary, but most have a more complicated basis.\nA teratogen is any substance to which a woman is\nexposed that has the potential to harm the embryo orfetus. Links between a drug or other chemical exposureduring pregnancy and a risk for CP are difficult to prove.However, any substance that might affect fetal braindevelopment, directly or indirectly, could increase therisk for CP. Furthermore, any substance that increases therisk for premature delivery and low birth weight, such asalcohol, tobacco, or cocaine , among others, might indi-\nrectly increase the risk for CP.\nThe fetus receives all nutrients and oxygen from\nblood that circulates through the placenta. Therefore,anything that interferes with normal placental functionmight adversely affect development of the fetus, includ-ing the brain, or might increase the risk for prematuredelivery. Structural abnormalities of the placenta, prema-ture detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall(abruption), and placental infections (chorioamnionitis)are thought to pose some risk for CP.\nCertain conditions in the mother during pregnancy\nmight pose a risk to fetal development leading to CP.Women with autoimmune anti-thyroid or anti-phospho-lipid (APA) antibodies are at slightly increased risk forCP in their children. A potentially important clue uncov-ered recently points toward high levels of cytokines inthe maternal and fetal circulation as a possible risk forCP. Cytokines are proteins associated with inflammation,such as from infection or autoimmune disorders , and\nthey may be toxic to neurons in the fetal brain.

A woman has some risk of developing the same com-\nplications in more than one pregnancy, slightly increas-ing the risk for more than one child with CP.\nSerious physical trauma to the mother during preg-\nnancy could result in direct trauma to the fetus as well, orinjuries to the mother could compromise the availabilityof nutrients and oxygen to the developing fetal brain.\nPerinatal causes\nBirth asphyxia significant enough to result in CP is\nnow uncommon in developed countries. Tight nuchalcord (umbilical cord around the baby’s neck) and pro-lapsed cord (cord delivered before the baby) are possiblecauses of birth asphyxia, as are bleeding and other com-plications associated with placental abruption and pla-\ncenta previa (placenta lying over the cervix).\nInfection in the mother is sometimes not passed to\nthe fetus through the placenta, but is transmitted to thebaby during delivery. Any such infection that results inserious illness in the newborn has the potential to pro-duce some neurological damage.\nPostnatal causes\nThe remaining 15% of CP is due to neurologic\ninjury sustained after birth.

This may lead to other complications, including\nsevere jaundice , which can cause CP. Rh disease in the\nnewborn is now rare in developed countries due to rou-tine screening of maternal blood type and treatment ofpregnancies at risk. The routine, effective treatment ofjaundice due to other causes has also made it an infre-quent cause of CP in developed countries. Rh blood typeposes a risk for recurrence of Rh disease if treatment isnot provided.\nSerious infections that affect the brain directly, such\nas meningitis and encephalitis , may cause irreversible\ndamage to the brain, leading to CP. A seizure disorder\nearly in life may cause CP, or may be the product of ahidden problem that causes CP in addition to seizures.Unexplained (idiopathic) seizures are hereditary in onlya small percentage of cases. Although rare in infants bornhealthy at or near term, intracerebral hemorrhage andbrain embolism, like fetal stroke, are sometimes genetic.\nPhysical trauma to an infant or child resulting in\nbrain injury, such as from abuse, accidents, or near\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 703Cerebral palsyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 703drowning/suffocation, might cause CP. Likewise, inges-\ntion of a toxic substance such as lead, mercury, poisons,or certain chemicals could cause neurological damage.Accidental overdose of certain medications might alsocause similar damage to the central nervous system.\nBy definition, the defect in cerebral function causing\nCP is nonprogressive. However, the symptoms of CPoften change over time. Most of the symptoms of CPrelate in some way to the aberrant control of muscles. Toreview, CP is categorized first by the type of move-ment/postural disturbance(s) present, then by a descrip-tion of which limbs are affected, and finally by the sever-ity of motor impairment. For example, spastic diplegiarefers to continuously tight muscles that have no volun-tary control in both legs, while athetoid quadraparesisdescribes uncontrolled writhing movements and muscleweakness in all four limbs. These three-part descriptionsare helpful in providing a general picture, but cannot givea complete description of any one person with CP. Inaddition, the various “forms” of CP do not occur withequal frequency—spastic diplegia is seen in more indi-viduals than is athetoid quadraparesis. CP can also beloosely categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, butthese are very subjective terms with no firm boundariesbetween them.\nA muscle that is tensed and contracted is hypertonic,\nwhile excessively loose muscles are hypotonic. Spastic,hypertonic muscles can cause serious orthopedic prob-lems, including scoliosis (spine curvature), hip disloca-\ntion, or contractures . A contracture is shortening of a\nmuscle, aided sometimes by a weak-opposing force froma neighboring muscle. Contractures may become perma-nent, or “fixed,” without some sort of intervention. Fixedcontractures may cause postural abnormalities in theaffected limbs. Clenched fists and contracted feet (equi-nus or equinovarus) are common in people with CP.Spasticity in the thighs causes them to turn in and crossat the knees, resulting in an unusual method of walkingknown as a “scissors gait.” Any of the joints in the limbsmay be stiff (immobilized) due to spasticity of theattached muscles.\nAthetosis and dyskinesia often occur with spasticity,\nbut do not often occur alone. The same is true of ataxia.It is important to remember that “mild CP” or “severeCP” refers not only to the number of symptoms present,but also to the level of involvement of any particularclass of symptoms.\nMechanisms that can cause CP are not always\nrestricted to motor-control areas of the brain. Other neu-rologically based symptoms may include:\n• mental retardation/learning disabilities\n• behavioral disorders• seizure disorders\n• visual impairment\n• hearing loss\n• speech impairment (dysarthria)\n• abnormal sensation and perception\nThese problems may have a greater impact on a\nchild’s life than the physical impairments of CP, althoughnot all children with CP are affected by other problems.Many infants and children with CP have growth impair-ment. About one-third of individuals with CP have moder-ate-to-severe mental retardation, one-third have mild men-tal retardation, and one-third have normal intelligence.\nDiagnosis\nThe signs of CP are not usually noticeable at birth.\nChildren normally progress through a predictable set ofdevelopmental milestones through the first 18 months oflife. Children with CP, however, tend to develop theseskills more slowly because of their motor impairments,and delays in reaching milestones are usually the firstsymptoms of CP. Babies with more severe cases of CPare usually diagnosed earlier than others.\nSelected developmental milestones, and the ages for\nnormally acquiring them, are given below. If a child doesnot acquire the skill by the age shown in parentheses,there is some cause for concern.\n• sits well unsupported—six months (eight–10 months)\n• babbles—six months (eight months)• crawls—nine months (12 months)\n• finger feeds, holds bottle—nine months (12 months)\n• walks alone—12 months (15–18 months)\n• uses one or two words other than dada/mama—12\nmonths (15 months)\n• walks up and down steps—24 months (24–36 months)• turns pages in books; removes shoes and socks—24\nmonths (30 months)\nChildren do not consistently favor one hand over the\nother before 12–18 months, and doing so may be a signthat the child has difficulty using the other hand. Thissame preference for one side of the body may show up asasymmetric crawling or, later on, favoring one leg whileclimbing stairs.\nIt must be remembered that children normally\nprogress at somewhat different rates, and slow beginningaccomplishment is often followed by normal develop-ment. Other causes for developmental delay—somebenign, some serious—should be excluded before con-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 704Cerebral palsyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 704sidering CP as the answer. CP is nonprogressive, so con-\ntinued loss of previously acquired milestones indicatesthat CP is not the cause of the problem.\nNo one test is diagnostic for CP, but certain factors\nincrease suspicion. The Apgar score measures a baby’scondition immediately after birth. Babies that have lowApgar scores are at increased risk for CP. Presence ofabnormal muscle tone or movements may indicate CP, asmay the persistence of infantile reflexes. Imaging of thebrain using ultrasound, x rays, MRI, and/or CT scans mayreveal a structural anomaly. Some brain lesions associatedwith CP include scarring, cysts, expansion of the cerebralventricles ( hydrocephalus ), periventricular leukomalacia\n(an abnormality of the area surrounding the ventricles),areas of dead tissue (necrosis), and evidence of an intra-cerebral hemorrhage or blood clot. Blood and urine bio-chemical tests, as well as genetic tests, may be used to ruleout other possible causes, including muscle and peripheralnerve diseases, mitochondrial and metabolic diseases, andother inherited disorders. Evaluations by a pediatric devel-opmental specialist and a geneticist may be of benefit.\nTreatment\nCerebral palsy cannot be cured, but many of the dis-\nabilities it causes can be managed through planning andtimely care. Treatment for a child with CP depends on theseverity, nature, and location of the primary muscular symp-toms, as well as any associated problems that might be pre-sent. Optimal care of a child with mild CP may involve reg-ular interaction with only a physical therapist and occupa-tional therapist, whereas care for a more severely affectedchild may include visits to multiple medical specialiststhroughout life. With proper treatment and an effective plan,most people with CP can lead productive, happy lives.\nTherapy\nSpasticity, muscle weakness, coordination, ataxia,\nand scoliosis are all significant impairments that affect theposture and mobility of a person with CP. Physical andoccupational therapists work with the patient, and the fam-ily, to maximize the ability to move affected limbs, devel-op normal motor patterns, and maintain posture. “Assistivetechnology,” things such as wheelchairs, walkers, shoeinserts, crutches, and braces, are often required. A speechtherapist, and high-tech aids such as computer-controlledcommunication devices, can make a tremendous differ-ence in the life of those who have speech impairments.\nMedications\nBefore fixed contractures develop, muscle-relaxant\ndrugs such as diazepam (Valium), dantrolene (Dantri-um), and baclofen (Lioresal) may be prescribed. Botu-\nlinum toxin (Botox), a newer and highly effective treat-ment, is injected directly into the affected muscles. Alco-hol or phenol injections into the nerve controlling themuscle are another option. Multiple medications areavailable to control seizures, and athetosis can be treatedusing medications such as trihexyphenidyl HCl (Artane)and benztropine (Cogentin).\nSurgery\nFixed contractures are usually treated with either\nserial casting or surgery. The most commonly used surgi-cal procedures are tenotomy, tendon transfer, and dorsalrhizotomy. In tenotomy, tendons of the affected muscleare cut and the limb is cast in a more normal positionwhile the tendon regrows. Alternatively, tendon transferinvolves cutting and reattaching a tendon at a differentpoint on the bone to enhance the length and function ofthe muscle. A neurosurgeon performing dorsal rhizotomycarefully cuts selected nerve roots in the spinal cord toprevent them from stimulating the spastic muscles. Neu-rosurgical techniques in the brain such as implanting tinyelectrodes directly into the cerebellum, or cutting a por-tion of the hypothalamus, have very specific uses andhave had mixed results.\nEducation\nParents of a child newly diagnosed with CP are not\nlikely to have the necessary expertise to coordinate thefull range of care their child will need. Althoughknowledgeable and caring medical professionals areindispensable for developing a care plan, a potentiallymore important source of information and advice isother parents who have dealt with the same set of diffi-culties. Support groups for parents of children with CPcan be significant sources of both practical advice andemotional support. Many cities have support groupsthat can be located through the United Cerebral PalsyAssociation, and most large medical centers have spe-cial multidisciplinary clinics for children with develop-mental disorders.\nPrognosis\nCerebral palsy can affect every stage of maturation,\nfrom childhood through adolescence to adulthood. Ateach stage, those with CP, along with their caregivers,must strive to achieve and maintain the fullest range ofexperiences and education consistent with their abilities.The advice and intervention of various professionalsremains crucial for many people with CP. Although CPitself is not considered a terminal disorder, it can affect aperson’s lifespan by increasing the risk for certain med-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 705Cerebral palsyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 705ical problems. People with mild cerebral palsy may have\nnear-normal lifespans, but the lifespan of those withmore severe forms may be shortened. However, over90% of infants with CP survive into adulthood.\nThe cause of most cases of CP remains unknown,\nbut it has become clear in recent years that birth difficul-ties are not to blame in most cases. Rather, developmen-tal problems before birth, usually unknown and generallyundiagnosable, are responsible for most cases. The rateof survival for preterm infants has leveled off in recentyears, and methods to improve the long-term health ofthese at-risk babies are now being sought. Currentresearch is also focusing on the possible benefits of rec-ognizing and treating coagulopathies and inflammatorydisorders in the prenatal and perinatal periods. The use ofmagnesium sulfate in pregnant women with preeclamp-sia or threatened preterm delivery may reduce the risk ofCP in very preterm infants. Finally, the risk of CP can bedecreased through good maternal nutrition , avoidance\nof drugs and alcohol during pregnancy, and prevention orprompt treatment of infections.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMiller, Freema, and Steven J.

Polzin, MS\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nanalysis\nDefinition\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a laboratory\ntest to examine a sample of the fluid surrounding thebrain and spinal cord. This fluid is a clear, watery liquidthat protects the central nervous system from injury andcushions it from the surrounding bone structure. It con-tains a variety of substances, particularly glucose (sugar),protein, and white blood cells from the immune system.The fluid is withdrawn through a needle in a procedurecalled a lumbar puncture.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a CSF analysis is to diagnose med-\nical disorders that affect the central nervous system.Some of these conditions include:\n• viral and bacterial infections, such as meningitis and\nencephalitis\n• tumors or cancers of the nervous system• syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease• bleeding (hemorrhaging) around the brain and spinal\ncord\n• multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects the myelin\ncoating of the nerve fibers of the brain and spinal cord\n• Guillain-Barré syndrome, an inflammation of the nerves.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 706Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 706Precautions\nIn some circumstances, a lumbar puncture to with-\ndraw a small amount of CSF for analysis may lead toserious complications. Lumbar puncture should be per-formed only with extreme caution, and only if the bene-fits are thought to outweigh the risks, in certain condi-tions. For example, in people who have blood clotting(coagulation) or bleeding disorders, lumbar puncturecan cause bleeding that can compress the spinal cord. Ifthere is a large brain tumor or other mass, removal of\nCSF can cause the brain to droop down within the skullcavity (herniate), compressing the brain stem and othervital structures, and leading to irreversible brain damageor death . These problems are easily avoided by check-\ning blood coagulation through a blood test and by doinga computed tomography scan (CT) or magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) scan before attempting the lum-\nbar puncture. In addition, a lumbar puncture procedureshould never be performed at the site of a localized skininfection on the lower back because the infection maybe introduced into the CSF and may spread to the brainor spinal cord.Description\nThe procedure to remove cerebrospinal fluid is\ncalled a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, because the areaof the spinal column used to obtain the sample is in thelumbar spine, or lower section of the back. In rareinstances, such as a spinal fluid blockage in the middle ofthe back, a doctor may perform a spinal tap in the neck.The lower lumbar spine (usually between the vertebraeknown as L4–5) is preferable because the spinal cordstops near L2, and a needle introduced below this levelwill miss the spinal cord and encounter only nerve roots,which are easily pushed aside.\nA lumbar puncture takes about 30 minutes. Patients\ncan undergo the test in a doctor’s office, laboratory, oroutpatient hospital setting. Sometimes it requires aninpatient hospital stay. If the patient has spinal arthritis,is extremely uncooperative, or obese, it may be necessaryto introduce the spinal needle using x-ray guidance.\nIn order to get an accurate sample of cerebrospinal\nfluid, it is critical that a patient is in the proper position.The spine must be curved to allow as much space as possi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 707Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\nSpinal cord\nCerebrospinal fluidVertebrae\nDuring a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, a procedure in which cerebrospinal fluid is aspirated, the physician inserts a hollow,\nthin needle in the space between two vertebrae of the lower back and slowly advances it toward the spine.The cerebrospinalfluid pressure is then measured and the fluid is withdrawn for laboratory analysis.

The mostcommon position is for the patient to lie on his or her sidewith the back at the edge of the exam table, head and chinbent down, knees drawn up to the chest, and arms claspedaround the knees. (Small infants and people who are obesemay need to curve their spines in a sitting position.) Peo-ple should talk to their doctor if they have any questionsabout their position because it is important to be comfort-able and to remain still during the entire procedure. In fact,the doctor will explain the procedure to the patient (orguardian) so that the patient can agree in writing to have itdone (informed consent). If the patient is anxious or unco-operative, a short-acting sedative may be given.\nDuring a lumbar puncture, the doctor drapes the\nback with a sterile covering that has an opening over thepuncture site and cleans the skin surface with an antisep-tic solution. Patients receive a local anesthetic to mini-mize any pain in the lower back.\nThe doctor inserts a hollow, thin needle in the space\nbetween two vertebrae of the lower back and slowlyadvances it toward the spine.

The amountof fluid collected depends on the type and number oftests needed to diagnose a particular medical disorder.\nIn some cases, the doctor must remove and reposi-\ntion the needle. This occurs when there is not an evenflow of fluid, the needle hits bone or a blood vessel, orthe patient reports sharp, unusual pain.\nPreparation\nPatients can go about their normal activities before a\nlumbar puncture. Experts recommend that patients relaxbefore the procedure to release any muscle tension, sincethe lumbar puncture needle must pass through muscletissue before it reaches the spinal canal. A patient’s levelof relaxation before and during the procedure plays acritical role in the test’s success.\nAftercare\nAfter the procedure, the doctor covers the site of the\npuncture with a sterile bandage. Patients must avoid sit-ting or standing and remain lying down for as long as sixhours after the lumbar puncture. They should also drinkplenty of fluid to help prevent lumbar punctureheadache , which is discussed in the next section.\nRisks\nFor most people, the most common side effect after\nthe removal of CSF is a headache. This occurs in10–30% of adult patients and in up to 40% of children. Itis caused by a decreased CSF pressure related to a smallleak of CSF through the puncture site. These headachesusually are a dull pain, although some people report athrobbing sensation. A stiff neck and nausea may accom-pany the headache. Lumbar puncture headaches typicallybegin within two days after the procedure and persistfrom a few days to several weeks or months.\nSince an upright position worsens the pain, patients\nwith a lumbar puncture headache can control the pain bylying in a flat position and taking a prescription or non-prescription pain relief medication, preferably one con-taining caffeine . In rare cases, the puncture site leak is\n“patched” using the patient’s own blood.\nPeople should talk to their doctor about complica-\ntions from a lumbar puncture. In most cases, this test toanalyze CSF is a safe and effective procedure. Somepatients experience pain, difficulty urinating, infection,or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the puncture siteafter the procedure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 708Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 708Normal results\nNormal CSF is clear and colorless.

    "title": "Cerumen impaction",
    "content": "Cerumen impaction\nDefinition\nCerumen impaction is a condition in which earwax\nhas become tightly packed in the external ear canal to thepoint that the canal is blocked.\nDescription\nCerumen impaction develops when earwax accumu-\nlates in the inner part of the ear canal and blocks theeardrum. It affects between 2–6% of the general popula-tion in the United States. Impaction does not happenunder normal circumstances because cerumen is pro-duced by glands in the outer part of the ear canal; it is notproduced in the inner part. The cerumen traps sand ordust particles before they reach the ear drum. It also pro-tects the outer part of the ear canal because it repelswater. The slow movement of the outer layer of skin ofthe ear canal carries cerumen toward the outer opening ofthe ear. As the older cerumen reaches the opening of theear, it dries out and falls away.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nCerumen is most likely to become impacted when it\nis pushed against the eardrum by cotton-tipped applica-tors, hair pins, or other objects that people put in theirears; and when it is trapped against the eardrum by ahearing aid. Less common causes of cerumen impactioninclude overproduction of earwax by the glands in theear canal, or an abnormally shaped ear canal.\nSymptoms\nThe most important symptom of cerumen impaction\nis partial loss of hearing. Other symptoms are itching ,\ntinnitus (noise or ringing in the ears), a sensation of full-\nness in the ear, and pain .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 709Cerumen impactionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 709Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of impacted cerumen is usually made\nby examining the ear canal and eardrum with an oto-scope, an instrument with a light attached that allows thedoctor to look into the canal.\nTreatment\nIrrigation is the most common method of removing\nimpacted cerumen. It involves washing out the ear canalwith water from a commercial irrigator or a syringe witha catheter attached. Although some doctors use WaterPiks to remove cerumen, most do not recommend thembecause the stream of water is too forceful and may dam-age the eardrum. The doctor may add a small amount ofalcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other antiseptic. Thewater must be close to body temperature; if it is too coldor too warm, the patient may feel dizzy or nauseated.After the ear has been irrigated, the doctor will applyantibiotic ear drops to protect the ear from infection.\nIrrigation should not be used to remove cerumen if\nthe patient’s eardrum is ruptured or missing; if the patienthas a history of chronic otitis media (inflammation of\nthe middle ear) or a myringotomy (cutting the eardrum toallow fluid to escape from the middle ear); or if thepatient has hearing in only one ear.\nIf irrigation cannot be used or fails to remove the\ncerumen, the patient is referred to an ear, nose, and throat(ENT) specialist. The specialist can remove the wax witha vacuum device or a curette, which is a small scoop-shaped surgical instrument.\nSome doctors prescribe special ear drops, such as\nCerumenex, to soften the wax. The most common sideeffect of Cerumenex is an allergic skin reaction. Over-\nthe-counter wax removal products include Debrox orMurine Ear Drops. A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxidemay also be used.

    "content": "Cervical cancer\nDefinition\nCervical cancer is a disease in which the cells of the\ncervix become abnormal and start to grow uncontrol-lably, forming tumors.Description\nIn the United States, cervical cancer is the fifth most\ncommon cancer among women aged 35–54, and the thirdmost common cancer of the female reproductive tract. Insome developing countries, it is the most common typeof cancer. It generally begins as an abnormality in thecells on the outside of the cervix. The cervix is the lowerpart or neck of the uterus (womb). It connects the bodyof the uterus to the vagina (birth canal).\nApproximately 90% of cervical cancers are squamous\ncell carcinomas. This type of cancer originates in the thin,flat, squamous cells on the surface of the ectocervix, thepart of the cervix that is next to the vagina. (Squamouscells are the thin, flat cells of the surfaces of the skin andcervix and linings of various organs.) Another 10% of cer-vical cancers are of the adenocarcinoma type. This canceroriginates in the mucus-producing cells of the inner orendocervix, near the body of the uterus. Occasionally, thecancer may have characteristics of both types and is calledadenosquamous carcinoma or mixed carcinoma.\nThe initial changes that may occur in some cervical\ncells are not cancerous. However, these precancerouscells form a lesion called dysplasia or a squamousintraepithelial lesion (SIL), since it occurs within theepithelial or outer layer of cells. These abnormal cellscan also be described as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN). Moderate to severe dysplasia may be called carci-noma in situ or non-invasive cervical cancer.\nDysplasia is a common condition and the abnormal\ncells often disappear without treatment. However, theseprecancerous cells can become cancerous. This may takeyears, although it can happen in less than a year. Eventu-ally, the abnormal cells start to grow uncontrollably intothe deeper layers of the cervix, becoming an invasive cer-vical cancer.\nAlthough cervical cancer used to be one of the most\ncommon causes of cancer death among American\nwomen, in the past 40 years there has been a 75% decreasein mortality. This is primarily due to routine screeningwith Pap tests (Pap smear), to identify precancerous andearly-invasive stages of cervical cancer. With treatment,these conditions have a cure rate of nearly 100%.\nWorldwide, there are more than 400,000 new cases\nof cervical cancer diagnosed each year. The AmericanCancer Society (ACS) estimates that there will be 12,900new cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in theUnited States in 2001. More than one million womenwill be diagnosed with a precancerous lesion or non-invasive cancer of the cervix.\nOlder women are at the highest risk for cervical can-\ncer. Although girls under the age of 15 rarely develop this\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 711Cervical cancerKEY TERMS\nCerumen —The medical term for earwax.\nCurette —A small scoop-shaped surgical instru-\nment that can be used to remove cerumen if irriga-tion does not work or cannot be used.\nImpaction —A condition in which earwax has\nbecome tightly packed in the outer ear to the pointthat the external ear canal is blocked.\nIrrigation —The technique of removing cerumen\nfrom the ear canal by flushing it with water.\nMyringotomy —Surgical cutting of the ear drum to\nallow fluid to escape from the middle ear.\nOtitis media —Inflammation of the middle ear.\nPatients who have had recurrent otitis mediashould not have cerumen removed by irrigation.\nTinnitus —A sensation of noise or ringing in the ears.\nTinnitus may be a symptom of cerumen impaction.GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 711cancer, the risk factor begins to increase in the late teens.\nRates for carcinoma in situ peak between the ages of 20and 30. In the United States, the incidence of invasivecervical cancer increases rapidly with age for AfricanAmerican women over the age of 25. The incidence risesmore slowly for Caucasian women. However, womenover age 65 account for more than 25% of all cases ofinvasive cervical cancer.\nThe incidence of cervical cancer is highest among\npoor women and among women in developing countries.In the United States, the death rates from cervical cancerare higher among Hispanic, Native American, andAfrican American women than among Caucasianwomen. These groups of women are much less likely toreceive regular Pap tests. Therefore, their cervical can-cers usually are diagnosed at a much later stage, after thecancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nCauses and symptoms\nHuman papilloma virus\nInfection with the common human papilloma virus\n(HPV) is a cause of approximately 90% of all cervicalcancers. There are more than 80 types of HPV. About 30of these types can be transmitted sexually, includingthose that cause genital warts (papillomas). About half\nof the sexually transmitted HPVs are associated with cer-vical cancer. These “high-risk” HPVs produce a proteinthat can cause cervical epithelial cells to grow uncontrol-lably. The virus makes a second protein that interfereswith tumor suppressors that are produced by the humanimmune system. The HPV-16 strain is thought to be acause of about 50% of cervical cancers.\nMore than six million women in the United States\nhave persistent HPV infections, for which there is nocure. Nevertheless, most women with HPV do not devel-op cervical cancer.\nSymptoms of invasive cervical cancer\nMost women do not have symptoms of cervical can-\ncer until it has become invasive. At that point, the symp-toms may include:\n• unusual vaginal discharge\n• light vaginal bleeding or spots of blood outside of nor-\nmal menstruation\n•pain or vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse\n• post-menopausal vaginal bleeding\nOnce the cancer has invaded the tissue surrounding\nthe cervix, a woman may experience pain in the pelvicregion and heavy bleeding from the vagina.Diagnosis\nThe Pap test\nMost often, cervical cancer is first detected with a\nPap test that is performed as part of a regular pelvic\nexamination. The vagina is spread with a metal or plasticinstrument called a speculum. A swab is used to removemucus and cells from the cervix. This sample is sent to alaboratory for microscopic examination.\nThe Pap test is a screening tool rather than a diag-\nnostic tool. It is very efficient at detecting cervicalabnormalities. The Bethesda System commonly is usedto report Pap test results. A negative test means that noabnormalities are present in the cervical tissue. A posi-tive Pap test describes abnormal cervical cells as low-grade or high-grade SIL, depending on the extent ofdysplasia. About 5–10% of Pap tests show at least mildabnormalities. However, a number of factors other thancervical cancer can cause abnormalities, includinginflammation from bacteria or yeast infections. A fewmonths after the infection is treated, the Pap test isrepeated.\nBiopsy\nFollowing an abnormal Pap test, a colposcopy is\nusually performed. The physician uses a magnifyingscope to view the surface of the cervix. The cervix maybe coated with an iodine solution that causes normal cellsto turn brown and abnormal cells to turn white or yellow.This is called a Schiller test. If any abnormal areas areobserved, a colposcopic biopsy may be performed. Abiopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for micro-scopic examination by a pathologist.\nOther types of cervical biopsies may be performed.\nAn endocervical curettage is a biopsy in which a narrowinstrument called a curette is used to scrape tissue frominside the opening of the cervix. A cone biopsy, orconization, is used to remove a cone-shaped piece of tis-sue from the cervix. In a cold knife cone biopsy, a surgi-cal scalpel or laser is used to remove the tissue. A loopelectrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a conebiopsy using a wire that is heated by an electrical cur-rent. Cone biopsies can be used to determine whetherabnormal cells have invaded below the surface of thecervix. They also can be used to treat many precancersand very early cancers. Biopsies may be performed witha local or general anesthetic. They may cause crampingand bleeding.\nDiagnosing the stage\nFollowing a diagnosis of cervical cancer, various\nprocedures may be used to stage the disease (determine\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 712Cervical cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 712how far the cancer has spread). For example, additional\npelvic exams may be performed under anesthesia.\nThere are several procedures for determining if cer-\nvical cancer has invaded the urinary tract. With cys-\ntoscopy , a lighted tube with a lens is inserted through the\nurethra (the urine tube from the bladder to the exterior)and into the bladder to examine these organs for cancer-ous cells. Tissue samples may be removed for micro-scopic examination by a pathologist. Intravenous urog-\nraphy (intravenous pyelogram or IVP) is an x ray of the\nurinary system, following the injection of special dye.The kidneys remove the dye from the bloodstream andthe dye passes into the ureters (the tubes from the kid-neys to the bladder) and bladder. IVP can detect ablocked ureter, caused by the spread of cancer to thepelvic lymph nodes (small glands that are part of theimmune system).\nA procedure called proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is\nsimilar to cystoscopy. It is used to determine whether thecancer has spread to the rectum or lower large intestine.\nComputed tomography (CT or CAT) scans, ultra-\nsound, or other imaging techniques may be used to deter-mine the spread of cancer to various parts of the body.With a CT scan, an x-ray beam rotates around the body,taking images from various angles. It is used to deter-mine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a magnetic\nfield to image the body, sometimes is used for evaluatingthe spread of cervical cancer. Chest x rays may be usedto detect cervical cancer that has spread to the lungs.\nTreatment\nFollowing a diagnosis of cervical cancer, the physi-\ncian takes a medical history and performs a completephysical examination . This includes an evaluation of\nsymptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer. The lymphnodes are examined for evidence that the cancer hasspread from the cervix. The choice of treatment dependson the clinical stage of the disease.\nThe FIGO system of staging\nThe International Federation of Gynecologists and\nObstetricians (FIGO) system usually is used to stage cer-vical cancer:\n• Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ; non-invasive cancer that is\nconfined to the layer of cells lining the cervix\n• Stage I: Cancer that has spread into the connective tis-\nsue of the cervix but is confined to the uterus\n• Stage IA: Very small cancerous area that is visible only\nwith a microscope• Stage IA1: Invasion area is less than 3 mm (0.13 in)\ndeep and 7 mm (0.33 in) wide\n• Stage IA2: Invasion area is 3–5 mm (0.13–0.2 in) deep\nand less than 7 mm (0.33 in) wide\n• Stage IB: Cancer can be seen without a microscope or is\ndeeper than 5 mm (0.2 in) or wider than 7 mm (0.33 in)\n• Stage IB1: Cancer is no larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)\n• Stage IB2: Stage IB cancer is larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)\n• Stage II: Cancer has spread from the cervix but is con-\nfined to the pelvic region\n• Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the upper region of the\nvagina, but not to the lower one-third of the vagina\n• Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to the parametrial tissue\nadjacent to the cervix\n• Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lower one-third of\nthe vagina or to the wall of the pelvis and may beblocking the ureters\n• Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the lower vagina but\nnot to the pelvic wall\n• Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or\nis blocking the flow of urine through the ureters to thebladder\n• Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body• Stage IV A: Cancer has spread to the bladder or rectum• Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to distant organs such as\nthe lungs\n• Recurrent: Following treatment, cancer has returned to\nthe cervix or some other part of the body\nIn addition to the stage of the cancer, factors such as\na woman’s age, general health, and preferences mayinfluence the choice of treatment. The exact location ofthe cancer within the cervix and the type of cervical can-cer also are important considerations.\nTreatment of precancer and carcinoma in situ\nMost low-grade SILs that are detected with Pap tests\nrevert to normal without treatment. Most high-gradeSILs require treatment. Treatments to remove precancer-ous cells include:\n• cold knife cone biopsy\n• LEEP\n• cryosurgery (freezing the cells with a metal probe)• cauterization or diathermy (burning off the cells)• laser surgery (burning off the cells with a laser beam)\nThese methods also may be used to treat cancer that\nis confined to the surface of the cervix (stage 0) and other\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 713Cervical cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 713early-stage cervical cancers in women who may want to\nbecome pregnant. They may be used in conjunction withother treatments. These procedures may cause bleedingor cramping. All of these treatments require close follow-up to detect any recurrence of the cancer.\nSurgery\nA simple hysterectomy is used to treat some stages\n0 and IA cervical cancers. Usually only the uterus isremoved, although occasionally the fallopian tubes andovaries are removed as well. The tissues adjoining theuterus, including the vagina, remain intact. The uterusmay be removed either through the abdomen or thevagina.\nIn a radical hysterectomy, the uterus and adjoining\ntissues, including the ovaries, the upper region (1 in) ofthe vagina near the cervix, and the pelvic lymph nodes,are all removed. A radical hysterectomy usually involvesabdominal surgery. However, it can be performed vagi-nally, in combination with a laparoscopic pelvic lymphnode dissection. With laparoscopy , a tube is inserted\nthrough a very small surgical incision for the removal ofthe lymph nodes. These operations are used to treatstages IA2, IB, and IIA cervical cancers, particularly inyoung women. Following a hysterectomy, the tissue isexamined to see if the cancer has spread and requiresadditional radiation treatment. Women who have hadhysterectomies cannot become pregnant, but complica-tions from a hysterectomy are rare.\nIf cervical cancer recurs following treatment, a\npelvic exenteration (extensive surgery) may be per-formed. This includes a radical hysterectomy, with theadditional removal of the bladder, rectum, part of thecolon, and/or all of the vagina. Such operations requirethe creation of new openings for the urine and feces. Anew vagina may be created surgically. Often the clitorisand other outer genitals are left intact.\nRecovery from a pelvic exenteration may take six\nmonths to two years. This treatment is successful with40–50% of recurrent cervical cancers that are confined tothe pelvis. If the recurrent cancer has spread to otherorgans, radiation or chemotherapy may be used to alle-\nviate some of the symptoms.\nRadiation\nRadiation therapy , which involves the use of high-\ndosage x rays or other high-energy waves to kill cancercells, often is used for treating stages IB, IIA, and IIBcervical cancers, or in combination with surgery. Withexternal-beam radiation therapy, the rays are focused onthe pelvic area from a source outside the body. Withimplant or internal radiation therapy, a pellet of radioac-tive material is placed internally, near the tumor. Alterna-\ntively, thin needles may be used to insert the radioactivematerial directly into the tumor.\nRadiation therapy to the pelvic region can have\nmany side effects:\n• skin reaction in the area of treatment• fatigue\n• upset stomach and loose bowels\n• vaginal stenosis (narrowing of the vagina due to build-\nup of scar tissue) leading to painful sexual intercourse\n• premature menopause in young women\n• problems with urination\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy, the use of one or more drugs to kill\ncancer cells, is used to treat disease that has spreadbeyond the cervix. Most often it is used followingsurgery or radiation treatment. Stages IIB, III, IV , andrecurrent cervical cancers usually are treated with acombination of external and internal radiation andchemotherapy. The common drugs used for cervicalcancer are cisplatin, ifosfamide, and fluorouracil. Thesemay be injected or taken by mouth. The National CancerInstitute recommends that chemotherapy with cisplatinbe considered for all women receiving radiation therapyfor cervical cancer.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy depend on a num-\nber of factors, including the type of drug, the dosage, andthe length of the treatment. Side effects may include:\n• nausea and vomiting• fatigue• changes in appetite• hair loss\n• mouth or vaginal sores\n• infections• menstrual cycle changes• premature menopause•infertility\n• bleeding or anemia (low red blood cell count)\nWith the exception of menopause and infertility,\nmost of the side effects are temporary.\nAlternative treatment\nBiological therapy sometimes is used to treat cervi-\ncal cancer, either alone or in combination withchemotherapy. Treatment with the immune-system pro-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 714Cervical cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 714tein interferon is used to boost the immune response.\nBiological therapy can cause temporary flu-like symp-toms and other side effects.\nSome research suggests that vitamin A (carotene)\nmay help to prevent or stop cancerous changes in cellssuch as those on the surface of the cervix. Other studiessuggest that vitamins C and E may reduce the risk of\ncervical cancer.\nPrognosis\nFor cervical cancers that are diagnosed in the pre-\ninvasive stage, the five-year-survival rate is almost 100%.When cervical cancer is detected in the early invasivestages, approximately 91% of women survive five yearsor more.

The death rate from cervicalcancer continues to decline by about 2% each year.Women over age 65 account for 40–50% of all deathsfrom cervical cancer.\nPrevention\nViral infections\nMost cervical cancers are preventable. More than\n90% of women with cervical cancer are infected withHPV . HPV infection is the single most important riskfactor. This is particularly true for young women becausethe cells lining the cervix do not fully mature until age18. These immature cells are more susceptible to cancer-causing agents and viruses.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 715Cervical cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 715Since HPV is a sexually-transmitted infection, sexu-\nal behaviors can put women at risk for HPV infectionand cervical cancer. These behaviors include:\n• sexual intercourse at age 16 or younger\n• partners who began having intercourse at a young age\n• multiple sexual partners\n• sexual partners who have had multiple partners (“high-\nrisk males”)\n• a partner who has had a previous sexual partner with\ncervical cancer\nHPV infection may not produce any symptoms, so\nsexual partners may not know that they are infected.However, Pap tests can detect the infection. Condoms donot necessarily prevent HPV infection.\nInfection with the human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS ) is a risk factor for cervical cancer. Women who\ntest positive for HIV may have impaired immune sys-tems that cannot correct precancerous conditions. Fur-thermore, sexual behavior that puts women at risk forHIV infection, also puts them at risk for HPV infection.There is some evidence suggesting that another sexuallytransmitted virus, the genital herpes virus, also may be\ninvolved in cervical cancer.\nSmoking\nSmoking may double the risk of cervical cancer.\nChemicals produced by tobacco smoke can damage theDNA of cervical cells. The risk increases with the numberof years a woman smokes and the amount she smokes.\nDiet and drugs\nDiets that are low in fruits and vegetables increase\nthe risk of cervical cancer. Women also have an increasedrisk of cervical cancer if their mothers took the drugdiethylstilbestrol (DES) while they were pregnant. Thisdrug was given to women between 1940 and 1971 to pre-vent miscarriages. Some statistical studies have suggest-ed that the long-term use of oral contraceptives may\nslightly increase the risk of cervical cancer.\nPap tests\nMost cases of cervical cancers are preventable,\nsince they start with easily detectable precancerouschanges. Therefore, the best prevention for cervical can-cer is a regular Pap test. When precancerous changes aredetected, appropriate treatment can prevent the develop-ment of invasive cancer. The ACS recommends thatwomen have annual Pap tests beginning when they firststart having sex or at age 18. Women who are pastmenopause or some women with hysterectomies contin-\nue to require Pap tests.\nThe National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early\nDetection Program provides free or low-cost Pap testsand treatment for women without health insurance, forolder women, and for members of racial and ethnicminorities. The program is administered through individ-ual states, under the direction of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention.\nSpecial concerns\nIf a woman is diagnosed with very early-stage (IA)\ncervical cancer while pregnant, the physician usually willrecommend a hysterectomy after the baby is born. Forlater-stage cancers, the pregnancy is terminated or the\nbaby is removed by cesarean section as soon as it can\nsurvive outside the womb. This is followed by a hysterec-tomy and/or radiation treatment. For the most advancedstages of cervical cancer, treatment is initiated despitethe pregnancy.\nMany women with cervical cancer have hysterec-\ntomies, which are major surgeries. Although normalactivities, including sexual intercourse, can be resumedin four-eight weeks, a woman may have emotional prob-lems following a hysterectomy. A strong support systemcan help with these difficulties.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFalco, Kristine. Reclaiming Our Lives After Breast and Gyne-\ncologic Cancer.

    "content": "Cervical conization\nDefinition\nCervical conization is both a diagnostic and treat-\nment tool used to detect and treat abnormalities of thecervix. It is also known as a cone biopsy or cold knifecone biopsy.\nPurpose\nCervical conization is performed if the results of a\ncervical biopsy have found a precancerous condition in thecervix. The cervix is the small cylindrical organ at thelower part of the uterus, which separates the uterus fromthe vagina. Cervical conization also may be performed ifthere is an abnormal cervical smear test ( PAP test ). A\nbiopsy is a diagnostic test in which tissue or cells areremoved from the body and examined under a microscope,primarily to look for cancer or other abnormalities.\nPrecautions\nAs with any operation that is performed under gen-\neral anesthesia, the patient must not eat or drink anythingfor six to eight hours before surgery.\nDescription\nThe patient lies on the table with her legs raised in\nstirrups, similar to the position when having a PAP test.KEY TERMS\nBiopsy —The removal of a small piece of living tis-\nsue for examination under a microscope.\nPAP test —The short term for Papanicolaou test,\nthis procedure tests a smear of cellular materialscraped from the cervix and examined under amicroscope to detect abnormal cells.\nThe patient is given general anesthesia, and the vagina is\nheld open with an instrument called a speculum. Using ascalpel or laser the doctor removes a cone-shaped pieceof the cervix containing the area with abnormal cells.The resulting crater is repaired by stitching flaps of tissueover the wound. Alternatively, the wound may be leftopen, and heat or freezing is used to stop bleeding.\nOnce the tissue has been removed, it is examined\nunder a microscope for signs of cancer. If cancer is pre-sent, other tests will be needed. Surgery will be per-formed to remove the cervix and uterus ( hysterectomy )\nand other treatments may be used as well. If the abnor-mal cells are precancerous, a laser can be used todestroy them.\nCold knife cone biopsy used to be the preferred\ntreatment for removing abnormal cells in the cervix.Now, most cone biopsies are performed using laser\nsurgery .

    "content": "Cervical disk disease\nDefinition\nCervical disk disease refers to a gradual deteriora-\ntion of the spongy disks in the top part of the spine.\nDescription\nThe spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae\nseparated by spongy rings of elastic material. Theserings, known as disks, are often compared to shock\nabsorbers because they help to cushion the vertebrae.Just as importantly, they also make it possible to turn thehead and neck. Over time, these disks slowly becomeflattened and less elastic due to everyday wear and tear.When this process occurs in the disks of the neck, it isreferred to as cervical disk disease. Other general termsfor this process include degenerative disk disease andintervertebral disk disease.\nCervical disk disease affects everyone to some\ndegree, often without causing any bothersome symp-toms. However, this condition can also lead to specificproblems related to nerve functioning. For example, theouter edge of a disk may tear, allowing the gelatinousmaterial inside to bulge outward ( herniated disk ). This\ncan put pressure on nerves that exit the spine. Two adja-cent vertebrae may rub together (sometimes resulting inbone spurs) that can also pinch these nerves. In othercases, the inner part of the ring may push on the spinalcord itself, which passes through the disk. Any of thesesituations can cause pain and limit movement. While\nsymptoms primarily affect the neck, they can also occurin other parts of the body.\nCauses and symptoms\nCervical disk disease is a gradual process that occurs\nwith aging , though poor posture, repeated lifting, and\ntobacco use can hasten its course. Symptoms includepain when moving the neck and limited neck movement.The condition can also affect the hand, shoulder, and armresulting in pain, numbness/tingling, and weakness. Ifthe spinal cord itself is affected, these symptoms mayoccur in the legs. Loss of bowel or bladder control mayalso occur.\nDiagnosis\nCervical disk disease is typically diagnosed by an\northopedist or a neurologist. After taking a medical his-tory and conducting a physical examination , the doctor\nwill recommend an imaging procedure to gather moreinformation about the nature of the problem. This mayinclude a CT scan, an MRI, or myelography . In addi-\ntion, an electromyogram (EMG) may be used to evalu-ate the functioning of nerves in the arms, hands, or legs.Cervical disk disease is typically covered by medicalinsurance.\nTreatment\nTreatment usually involves physical therapy, several\nweeks of drug therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflam-\nmatory drugs (NSAIDs), and limited use of a cervical\ncollar (to reduce neck movement). Neck traction and\nheat treatments may also be recommended. In some\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 718Cervical disk diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 718cases, steroids or anesthetic drugs may be injected into\nthe spinal canal to help alleviate symptoms. Aside fromthese measures, maintaining good posture and placing apillow under the neck and head during sleep can be help-ful. Treatment may last anywhere from several weeks tothree months or more. Neck surgery is not usuallyadvised unless other therapies have failed.\nAlternative treatment\nAcupuncture , therapeutic massage, and yoga are\nbelieved by some practitioners of alternative medicine tohave generalized pain-relieving effects. However, anytherapy that involves manipulating the neck is not recom-mended and should be approved by the primary doctorbeforehand.\nPrognosis\nIn most people symptoms go away within three\nmonths if not sooner.

    "title": "Cervical spondylosis",
    "content": "Cervical spondylosis\nDefinition\nCervical spondylosis refers to common age-related\nchanges in the area of the spine at the back of the neck.With age, the vertebrae (the component bones of thespine) gradually form bone spurs, and their shock-absorbing disks slowly shrink. These changes can alterthe alignment and stability of the spine. They may gounnoticed, or they may produce problems related to pres-sure on the spine and associated nerves and blood ves-sels. This pressure can cause weakness, numbness, andpain in various areas of the body. In severe cases, walk-\ning and other activities may be compromised.\nDescription\nAs it runs from the brain down the back, the spinal\ncord is protected by ringlike bones, called vertebrae,stacked one upon the other. The vertebrae are not indirect contact with one another, however. The interven-ing spaces are filled with structures called disks. Thedisks are made up of a tough, fibrous outer tissue with aninner core of elastic or gel-like tissue.\nOne of the most important functions of disks is pro-\ntecting the vertebrae and the nerves and blood vesselsbetween the vertebrae. The disks also lend flexibility to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 719Cervical spondylosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 719the spinal cord, facilitating movements such as turning\nthe head or bending the neck. As people age, disks gradu-ally become tougher and more unyielding. Disks alsoshrink with age, which reduces the amount of paddingbetween the vertebrae.\nAs the amount of padding shrinks, the spine loses\nstability. The vertebrae react by constructing osteo-phytes, commonly known as bone spurs. There are sevenvertebrae in the neck; development of osteophytes onthese bones is sometimes called cervical osteoarthritis .\nOsteophytes may help to stabilize the degenerating back-bone and help protect the spinal cord.\nBy age 50, 25–50% of people develop cervical spondy-\nlosis; by 75 years of age, it is seen in at least 70% of people.Although shrunken vertebral disks, osteophyte growth, andother changes in their cervical spine may exist, many ofthese people never develop significant problems.\nHowever, about 50% of people over age 50 experience\nneck pain and stiffness due to cervical spondylosis. Ofthese people, 25–40% have at least one episode of cervicalradiculopathy, a condition that arises when osteophytescompress nerves between the vertebrae. Another potentialproblem occurs if osteophytes, degenerating disks, or shift-ing vertebrae narrow the spinal canal. This pressure com-presses the spinal cord and its blood vessels, causing cervi-cal spondylitic myelopathy, a disorder in which large seg-ments of the spinal cord are damaged. This disorder affectsfewer than 5% of people with cervical spondylosis. Symp-toms of both cervical spondylitic myelopathy and cervicalradiculopathy may be present in some people.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs people age, shrinkage of the vertebral disks\nprompts the vertebrae to form osteophytes to stabilize theback bone. However, the position and alignment of thedisks and vertebrae may shift despite the osteophytes.Symptoms may arise from problems with one or moredisks or vertebrae.\nOsteophyte formation and other changes do not nec-\nessarily lead to symptoms, but after age 50, half of thepopulation experiences occasional neck pain and stiff-ness. As disks degenerate, the cervical spine becomesless stable, and the neck is more vulnerable to injuries,including muscle and ligament strains. Contact betweenthe edges of the vertebrae can also cause pain. In somepeople, this pain may be referred—that is, perceived asoccurring in the head, shoulders, or chest, rather than theneck. Other symptoms may include vertigo (a type ofdizziness ) or ringing in the ears.\nThe neck pain and stiffness can be intermittent, as\ncan symptoms of radiculopathy. Radiculopathy refers tocompression on the base, or root, of nerves that leadaway from the spinal cord. Normally, these nerves fit\ncomfortably through spaces between the vertebrae.These spaces are called intervertebral foramina. As theosteophytes form, they can impinge on this area andgradually make the fit between the vertebrae too snug.\nThe poor fit increases the chances that a minor inci-\ndent, such as overdoing normal activities, may placeexcess pressure on the nerve root, sometimes referred toas a pinched nerve. Pressure may also accumulate as adirect consequence of osteophyte formation. The pres-sure on the nerve root causes severe shooting pain in theneck, arms, shoulder, and/or upper back, depending onwhich nerve roots of the cervical spine are affected. Thepain is often aggravated by movement, but in most cases,symptoms resolve within four-six weeks.\nCervical spondylosis can cause cervical spondylitic\nmyelopathy through stenosis- or osteophyte-related pres-sure on the spinal cord. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of\nthe spinal canal—the area through the center of the verte-bral column occupied by the spinal cord. Stenosis occursbecause of misaligned vertebrae and out-of-place ordegenerating disks. The problems created by spondylosiscan be exacerbated if a person has a naturally narrowspinal canal. Pressure against the spinal cord can also becreated by osteophytes forming on the inner surface ofvertebrae and pushing against the spinal cord. Stenosis orosteophytes can compress the spinal cord and its bloodvessels, impeding or choking off needed nutrients to thespinal cord cells; in effect, the cells starve to death .\nWith the death of these cells, the functions that they\nonce performed are impaired. These functions mayinclude conveying sensory information to the brain ortransmitting the brain’s commands to voluntary muscles.Pain is usually absent, but a person may experience legnumbness and an inability to make the legs move proper-ly. Other symptoms can include clumsiness and weaknessin the hands, stiffness and weakness in the legs, and spon-taneous twitches in the legs. A person’s ability to walk isaffected, and a wide-legged, shuffling gait is sometimesadopted to compensate for the lack of sensation in thelegs and the accompanying, realistic fear of falling. Invery few cases, bladder control becomes a problem.\nDiagnosis\nCervical spondylosis is often suspected based on the\nsymptoms and their history. Careful neurological exami-nation can help determine which nerve roots are involved,based on the location of the pain and numbness, and thepattern of weakness and changes in reflex responses. Toconfirm the suspected diagnosis, and to rule out otherpossibilities, imaging tests are ordered. The first test is anx ray. X rays reveal the presence of osteophytes, stenosis,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 720Cervical spondylosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 720constricted space between the vertebrae, and misalign-\nment in the cervical spine—in short, an x ray confirmsthat a person has cervical spondylosis. To demonstratethat the condition is causing the symptoms, more detailsare needed. Other imaging tests, such as magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography myel-\nography , help assess effects of cervical spondylosis on\nassociated nerve tissue and blood vessels.\nAn MRI may be preferred, because it is a noninva-\nsive procedure and does not require injecting a contrastmedium as does computed tomography myelography.MRIs also have greater sensitivity for detecting diskproblems and spinal cord involvement, and the testallows the physician to create images of a larger areafrom various angles. However, these images may notshow enough detail about the vertebrae themselves. Com-puted tomography myelography yields a superior imageof the bones involved in cervical spondylosis.

A good diagnosis may bereached with either a computed tomography myelographyor an MRI, but sometimes complementary informationfrom both tests is necessary. Nerve conduction velocity,electromyogram (EMG), and/or somatosensory evokedpotential testing may help to confirm which nerve rootsare involved.\nTreatment\nWhen possible, conservative treatment of symptoms\nis preferred. Conservative treatment begins with rest—either restricting normal activities to a less strenuouslevel or bed rest for three to five days. If rest is not ade-quate to relieve symptoms, a cervical orthosis may beprescribed., such as a soft cervical collar or stiffer neckbrace to restrict neck movement and shift some of thehead’s weight from the neck to the shoulders. Cervical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 721Cervical spondylosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 721traction may also be suggested, either at home with the\nadvice of a physical therapist or in a health-care setting.\nPain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammato-\nry drugs , such as aspirin or ibuprofen. If these drugs are\nineffective, a short-term prescription for corticosteroids\nor muscle relaxants may be given. For chronic pain, tri-\ncyclic antidepressants can be prescribed. Although thesedrugs were developed to treat depression, they are alsoeffective in treating pain. Once any pain is resolved,exercises to strengthen neck muscle and preserve flexi-bility are prescribed.\nIf the pain is severe, a short treatment of epidural\ncorticosteroids may be prescribed with discretion. A cor-ticosteroid such as prednisone can be combined with ananaesthetic and injected with a long needle into the spacebetween the damaged disk and the covering of the nerveand spinal cord. Injection into the cervical epidural spacerelieves severe pain that is not managed with convention-al treatment. Frequent use of this treatment is not med-ically recommended and is used only if the more conser-vative therapy is not effective.\nIf pain is continuous and does not respond to conser-\nvative treatment, surgery may be suggested. Surgery isusually not recommended for neck pain, but it may benecessary to address radiculopathy and myelopathy.Surgery is particularly recommended for people whohave already developed moderate to severe symptoms ofmyelopathy, although age or poor health may prohibitthat recommendation. The specific details of the surgerydepend on the structures involved, but the overall goal isto relieve pressure on the nerve root, spinal cord, orblood vessels and to stabilize the spine.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative therapy is not meant to replace conven-\ntional medical treatment, but it can be a useful adjunct. Itsmain roles are to relieve tension, manage pain, andstrengthen neck and back muscles. Massage is one way torelieve tension, and yoga provides the additional benefit\nof strengthening muscles. Chiropractic and acupunc-\nture have been reported to relieve the pain associated\nwith disk problems, although great care needs to be takento avoid exacerbating them. Practitioners of the Alexan-\nder technique or the Feldenkrais method can provide\ninstruction on correct posture and exercise that may help\nprevent further symptoms. Vitamin and mineral supple-mentation along with herbal therapies and homeopathy\ncan help build and rebalance the weakened structure.\nPrognosis\nThe gradual progression of cervical spondylosis\ncannot be stopped; however, it doesn’t always causesymptoms. For the individuals who do experience prob-\nlems, conservative treatment is very effective in manag-ing the symptoms. Nearly all people with neck pain,approximately 75% of persons with radiculopathy, andup to 50% of people with myelopathy find relief throughtherapy alone. For the remaining people with radiculopa-thy or myelopathy, surgery may be recommended.Surgery is deemed successful in 70–80% of cases.\nPrevention\nSince cervical spondylosis is part of the normal\naging process, not much can be done to prevent it. It may\nbe possible to ward off some or all of the symptoms byengaging in regular physical exercise and limiting occu-pational or recreational activities that place pressure onthe head, neck, and shoulders. The best exercises for thehealth of the cervical spine are noncontact activities,such as swimming, walking, or yoga. Once symptomshave already developed, the emphasis is on symptommanagement rather than prevention.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBorenstein, David G., Sam W. Wiesel, and Scott D.

Cervicitis\ncan also be caused by birth control devices such as a cer-vical cap or diaphragm, or chemical exposure. Other riskfactors include multiple sexual partners or cervical trau-ma following birth. In postmenopausal women, cervicitisis sometimes related to a lack of estrogen.\nAlthough a woman may not notice any signs of\ninfection, symptoms of cervicitis include the following:\n• persistent unusual vaginal discharge\n• abnormal bleeding, either between periods or following\nsexual intercourse\n• painful sexual intercourse\n• vaginal pain\n• frequent need to urinate\n• burning or itching in the vaginal area\nDiagnosis\nThe standard method of diagnosing cervicitis is\nthrough a pelvic examination or a Pap smear. During thepelvic exam , the physician usually swabs the affected\narea, and then sends the tissue sample to a laboratory.The laboratory tries to identify the specific organismresponsible for causing the cervicitis. A biopsy to take asample of tissue from the affected area is sometimesrequired in order to rule out cancer .

Severe cases, however, may last fora few months, even after the therapy is complete. If thecervicitis was caused by a sexually transmitted disease,both partners should be treated with medication.\nPrevention\nPracticing safe sexual behavior, such as monogamy,\nis one way of lowering the prevalence of cervicitis. Inaddition, women who began sexual activity at a later agehave been shown to have a lower incidence of cervicitis.Another recommendation is to use a latex condom con-\nsistently during intercourse.

The procedure is performed in theUnited States on nearly one of every four babies deliv-ered—more than 900,000 babies each year. The proce-dure is often used in cases where the mother has had aprevious c-section. Dystocia, or difficult labor, is theother common cause of c-sections.\nDifficult labor is commonly caused by one of the\nthree following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’sbirth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus; orabnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequentcontractions.\nAnother major factor is fetal distress, a condition\nwhere the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal braindamage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-tress is often related to abnormalities in the position ofthe fetus or abnormalities in the birth canal, causingreduced blood flow through the placenta. Other condi-tions also can make c-section advisable, such as vaginalherpes, hypertension, and diabetes in the mother.Precautions\nThere are several ways that obstetricians and other\ndoctors diagnose conditions that may make a c-sectionnecessary. Ultrasound testing reveals the positions of thebaby and the placenta and may be used to estimate thebaby’s size and gestational age. Fetal heart monitors, inuse since the 1970s, transmit any signals of fetal distress.Oxygen deprivation may be determined by checking theamniotic fluid for meconium (feces)—a lack of oxygencauses an unborn baby to defecate. Oxygen deprivationmay also be determined by testing the pH of a bloodsample taken from the baby’s scalp; a pH of 7.25 or high-er is normal, between 7.2 and 7.25 is suspicious, andbelow 7.2 is a sign of trouble.\nWhen a c-section is being considered because labor\nis not progressing, the mother should first be encouragedto walk around to stimulate labor. Labor may also bestimulated with the drug oxytocin.\nWhen a c-section is being considered because the\nbaby is in a breech position, the doctor may first attemptto reposition the baby; this is called external cephalicversion. The doctor may also try a vaginal breech deliv-ery, depending on the size of the mother’s pelvis, the size\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 724Cesarean section\nThis baby is being delivered by cesarean section.

However, a c-section is safer than a vaginal deliverywhen the baby is 8 lb (3.6 kg) or larger, in a breech posi-tion with the feet crossed, or in a breech position with thehead hyperextended.\nA woman should receive regular prenatal care and\nbe able to alert her doctor to the first signs of trouble.Once labor begins, she should be encouraged to movearound and to urinate. The doctor should be conservativein diagnosing dystocia (nonprogressive labor) and fetaldistress, taking a position of “watchful waiting” beforedeciding to operate.\nDescription\nThe most common reason that a cesarean section is\nperformed (in 35% of all cases, according to the UnitedStates Public Health Service) is that the woman has had aprevious c-section. The “once a cesarean, always a cesare-an” rule originated when the classical uterine incision wasmade vertically; the resulting scar was weak and had a riskof rupturing in subsequent deliveries. Today, the incision isalmost always made horizontally across the lower end ofthe uterus (this is called a “low transverse incision”),resulting in reduced blood loss and a decreased chance ofrupture. This kind of incision allows many women to havea vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC).\nThe second most common reason that a c-section is\nperformed (in 30% of all cases) is difficult childbirth\ndue to nonprogressive labor (dystocia). Uterine contrac-KEY TERMS\nBreech presentation —The condition in which the\nbaby enters the birth canal with its buttocks or feetfirst.\nCephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) —The condi-\ntion in which the baby’s head is too large to fitthrough the mother’s pelvis.\nClassical incision —In a cesarean section, an incision\nmade vertically along the uterus; this kind of incisionmakes a larger opening but also creates more bleed-ing, a greater chance of infection, and a weaker scar.\nDystocia —Failure to progress in labor, either\nbecause the cervix will not dilate (expand) furtheror (after full dilation) the head does not descendthrough the mother’s pelvis.\nLow transverse incision —Incision made horizontal-\nly across the lower end of the uterus; this kind ofincision is preferred for less bleeding and stronger\nhealing.\nPlacenta previa —The placenta totally or partially\ncovers the cervix, preventing vaginal delivery.\nPlacental abruption —Separation of the placenta\nfrom the uterine wall before the baby is born, cut-ting off blood flow to the baby.\nProlapsed cord —The umbilical cord is pushed into\nthe vagina ahead of the baby and becomes com-pressed, cutting off blood flow to the baby.\nRespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) —Difficulty\nbreathing, found in infants with immature lungs.\nTransverse presentation —The baby is laying side-\nways across the cervix instead of head first.\nVBAC —Vaginal birth after cesarean.\ntions may be weak or irregular, the cervix may not be\ndilating, or the mother’s pelvic structure may not allowadequate passage for birth. When the baby’s head is toolarge to fit through the pelvis, the condition is calledcephalopelvic disproportion (CPD).\nAnother 12% of c-sections are performed to deliver\na baby in a breech presentation: buttocks or feet first.Breech presentation is found in about 3% of all births.\nIn 9% of all cases, c-sections are performed in\nresponse to fetal distress. Fetal distress refers to any situ-ation that threatens the baby, such as the umbilical cordgetting wrapped around the baby’s neck. This mayappear on the fetal heart monitor as an abnormal heartrate or rhythm.\nThe remaining 14% of c-sections are indicated by\nother serious factors. One is prolapse of the umbilicalcord: the cord is pushed into the vagina ahead of the babyand becomes compressed, cutting off blood flow to thebaby. Another is placental abruption : the placenta sepa-\nrates from the uterine wall before the baby is born, cut-ting off blood flow to the baby. The risk of this is espe-cially high in multiple births (twins, triplets, or more). Athird factor is placenta previa : the placenta covers the\ncervix partially or completely, making vaginal deliveryimpossible. In some cases requiring c-section, the baby isin a transverse position, lying horizontally across thepelvis, perhaps with a shoulder in the birth canal.\nThe mother’s health may make delivery by c-section\nthe safer choice, especially in cases of maternal diabetes,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 725Cesarean sectionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 725hypertension, genital herpes , Rh blood incompatibility,\nand preeclampsia (high blood pressure related to preg-\nnancy ).\nPreparation\nWhen a c-section becomes necessary, the mother is\nprepped for surgery. A catheter is inserted into her blad-der and an intravenous (IV) line is inserted into her arm.Leads for monitoring the mother’s heart rate, rhythm,and blood pressure are attached. In the operating room,the mother is given anesthesia—usually a regional anes-thetic (epidural or spinal), making her numb from belowher breasts to her toes. In some cases, a general anesthet-ic will be administered. Surgical drapes are placed overthe body, except the head; these drapes block the directview of the procedure.\nThe abdomen is washed with an anti-bacterial solu-\ntion and a portion of the pubic hair may be shaved. Thefirst incision opens the abdomen. Infrequently, it will bevertical from just below the navel to the top of the pubicbone, or more commonly, it will be a horizontal incisionacross and above the pubic bone (informally called a“bikini cut”).\nThe second incision opens the uterus. In most cases\na transverse incision is made. This is the favored typebecause it heals well and makes it possible for a womanto attempt a vaginal delivery in the future. The classicalincision is vertical. Because it provides a larger openingthan a low transverse incision, it is used in the most criti-cal situations, such as placenta previa. However, the clas-sical incision causes more bleeding, a greater risk ofabdominal infection, and a weaker scar, so the low trans-verse incision is preferred.\nOnce the uterus is opened, the amniotic sac is rup-\ntured and the baby is delivered. The time from the initialincision to birth is typically five minutes.\nOnce the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the new-\nborn is evaluated. The placenta is removed from themother, and her uterus and abdomen are stitched closed(surgical staples may be used instead in closing the outer-most layer of the abdominal incision). From birth throughsuturing may take 30–40 minutes. Thus the entire surgicalprocedure may be performed in less than one hour.\nAftercare\nA woman who undergoes a c-section requires both\nthe care given to any new mother and the care given toany patient recovering from major surgery. She should beoffered pain medication that does not interfere with\nbreastfeeding. She should be encouraged to get out of bedand walk around eight to 24 hours after surgery to stimu-late circulation (thus avoiding the formation of blood\nclots) and bowel movement. She should limit climbingstairs to once a day, and avoid lifting anything heavierthan the baby. She should nap as often as the baby sleeps,and arrange for help with the housework, meals, and careof other children. She may resume driving after twoweeks, although some doctors recommend waiting for sixweeks, the typical recovery period from major surgery.\nRisks\nBecause a c-section is a surgical procedure, it carries\nmore risk to both the mother and the baby. The maternaldeath rate is less than 0.02%, but that is four times the\nmaternal death rate associated with vaginal delivery.However, many women have a c-section for serious med-ical problems. The mother is at risk for increased bleeding(because a c-section may result in twice the blood loss ofa vaginal delivery) from the two incisions, the placentalattachment site, and possible damage to a uterine artery.Complications occur in less than 10% of cases. The moth-er may develop infection of either incision, the urinarytract, or the tissue lining the uterus (endometritis). Lesscommonly, she may receive injury to the surroundingorgans, like the bladder and bowel. When a general anes-thesia is used, she may experience complications from theanesthesia. Very rarely, she may develop a woundhematoma at the site of either incision or other blood clotsleading to pelvic thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the\nmajor vein running from the pelvis into the leg) or a pul-monary embolus (a blood clot lodging in the lung).\nNormal results\nThe after-effects of a c-section vary, depending on\nthe woman’s age, physical fitness, and overall health.Following this procedure, a woman commonly experi-ences gas pains, incision pain, and uterine contractions—which are also common in vaginal delivery. Her hospitalstay may be two to four days. Breastfeeding the baby isencouraged, taking care that it is in a position that keepsthe baby from resting on the mother’s incision. As thewoman heals, she may gradually increase appropriateexercises to regain abdominal tone. Full recovery may beseen in four to six weeks.\nThe prognosis for a successful vaginal birth after a\ncesarean (VBAC) may be at least 75%, especially when thec-section involved a low transverse incision in the uterusand there were no complications during or after delivery.\nAbnormal results\nOf the hundreds of thousands of women in the Unit-\ned States who undergo a c-section each year, about 500\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 726Cesarean sectionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 726die from serious infections, hemorrhaging, or other com-\nplications. These deaths may be related to the health con-ditions that made the operation necessary, and not simplyto the operation itself.\nUndergoing a c-section may also inflict psychologi-\ncal distress on the mother, beyond hormonal moodswings and postpartum depression (“baby blues”). The\nwoman may feel disappointment and a sense of failurefor not experiencing a vaginal delivery. She may feel iso-lated if the father or birthing coach is not with her in theoperating room, or if she is treated by an unfamiliar doc-tor rather than by her own doctor or midwife. She mayfeel helpless from a loss of control over labor and deliv-ery with no opportunity to actively participate. To over-come these feelings, the woman must understand whythe c-section was necessary. She must accept that shecouldn’t control the unforeseen events that made the c-section the optimum means of delivery, and recognizethat preserving the health and safety of both her and herchild was more important than her delivering vaginally.Women who undergo a c-section should be encouragedto share their feelings with others. Hospitals can oftenrecommend support groups for such mothers. Womenshould also be encouraged to seek professional help ifnegative emotions persist.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians. 8880 Ward Parkway,\nKansas City, MO 64114.

Itinvolves damage to the nerves that control the heart,digestive and other organs, and eventually leads to dam-age to these organs. Worldwide, Chagas’ disease affectsover 15 million persons, and kills 50,000 each year.Researchers believe that the parasite that causes the dis-ease is only found in the Americas.\nDescription\nWhen a person is infected with Chagas’ disease, the\nparasite known as Trypanosoma cruzi first causes a mild,\nshort-lived period of “acute” illness; then after a longperiod without symptoms, the effects of the infectionbegin to appear. The heart, esophagus, and colon aremost frequently involved. These organs become unableto contract properly, and begin to stretch or dilate.\nCauses and symptoms\nT. cruzi is carried by insects or bugs known as redu-\nviid or “kissing bugs.” These insects are very common inCentral and South America where they inhabit poorlyconstructed houses and huts. The insects deposit theirwaste material, exposing inhabitants to the parasites. Theparasites then enter the body by way of a cut or via theeyes or mouth. T. cruzi can also be transmitted by blood\ntransfusion . Eating uncooked, contaminated food or\nbreastfeeding can also transmit the disease. The reduvi-ids, in turn, become infected with the parasite by bitinginfected animals and humans.\nThere are three phases related to infection:\n• Acute phase lasts about two months, with non-specific\nsymptoms of low grade fever ,headache ,fatigue , and\nenlarged liver or spleen.\n• Indeterminate phase lasts 10–20 years, during which\ntime no symptoms occur, but the parasites are repro-ducing in various organs.\n• Chronic phase is the stage when symptoms related to\ndamage of major organs (heart, esophagus, colon) begin.\nIn the chronic phase, irregularities of heart rhythm,\nheart failure , and blood clots cause weakness, fainting ,\nand even sudden death .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 727Chagas’ diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 727Esophageal symptoms are related to difficulty with\nswallowing and chest pain . Because the esophagus does\nnot empty properly, food regurgitates into the lungs caus-ing cough ,bronchitis , and repeated bouts of pneumo-\nnia. Inability to eat, weight loss, and malnutrition\nbecome a significant factor in affecting survival.\nInvolvement of the large intestine (colon) causes\nconstipation , distention, and abdominal pain.\nDiagnosis\nThe best way to diagnose acute infection is to identi-\nfy the parasites in tissue or blood. Occasionally it is pos-sible to culture the organism from infected tissue, but thisprocess usually requires too much time to be of value. Inthe chronic phase, antibody levels can be measured.Efforts to develop new, more accurate tests are ongoing.\nTreatment\nIn most cases treatment of symptoms is all that is\npossible. Present medications can reduce the durationand severity of an acute infection, but are only 50%effective, at best, in eliminating the organisms.\nCardiac effects are managed with pacemakers and\nmedications. Esophageal complications require eitherendoscopic or surgical methods to improve esophagealemptying, similar to those used to treat the disorderknown as achalasia . Constipation is treated by increas-\ning fiber and bulk laxatives , or removal of diseased por-\ntions of the colon.KEY TERMS\nAchalasia —An esophageal disease of unknown\ncause, in which the lower sphincter or muscle isunable to relax normally, and leads to the accu-mulation of material within the esophagus.\nEndoscopy —Exam using an endoscope (a thin\nflexible tube which uses a lens or miniature cam-era to view various areas of the gastrointestinaltract). When the procedure is performed to exam-ine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pan-creas, the organs are not viewed directly, butrather indirectly through the injection of x ray.\nParasite —An organism that lives on or in another\nand takes nourishment (food and fluids) from thatorganism.\nRegurgitation —Flow of material back up the\nesophagus and into the throat or lungs.Prognosis\nThose patients with gastrointestinal complications\noften respond to some form of treatment. Cardiac prob-lems are more difficult to treat, particularly since trans-plant would rekindle infection.\nPrevention\nVisitors traveling to areas of known infection should\navoid staying in mud, adobe, or similar huts. Mosquitonets and insect repellents are useful in helping to avoidcontact with the bugs. Blood screening is not alwayseffective in many regions where infection is common. Itis necessary to carefully screen people who have emi-grated from Central and South America before they makeblood donations.\nResources\nBOOKS\nKirchoff, Louis V . “Trypanosomiasis.” In Harrison’s Principles\nof Internal Medicine , ed.

    "content": "Chancroid\nDefinition\nChancroid is a sexually transmitted disease caused\nby a bacterial infection that is characterized by painfulsores on the genitals.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 728ChancroidGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 728Description\nChancroid is an infection of the genitals that is\ncaused by the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi . Chan-\ncroid is a sexually transmitted disease, which means thatit is spread from person to person almost always by sexu-al contact. However, there have been a few cases inwhich healthcare providers have become infectedthrough contact with infected patients.\nCommon locations for chancroid sores (ulcers) in\nmen are the shaft or head of the penis, foreskin, thegroove behind the head of the penis, the opening of thepenis, and the scrotum. In women, common locations arethe labia majora (outer lips), labia minora (inner lips),perianal area (area around the anal opening), and innerthighs. It is rare for the ulcer(s) to be on the vaginal wallsor cervix. In about 50% of the patients with chancroid,the infection spreads to either or both of the lymph nodesin the groin.\nChancroid is most commonly found in developing\nand third world countries. In the United States, the mostcommon cause of genital ulcers is genital herpes , fol-\nlowed by syphilis , and then chancroid. As of 1997, there\nwere fewer than 1,500 cases of chancroid in the UnitedStates per year and it occurred primarily in AfricanAmericans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans.There are occasional localized outbreaks of chancroid inthe United States. In addition, the practice of exchangingsex for drugs has lead to a link between crack cocaine\nuse and chancroid.\nEven though the incidence of chancroid in the United\nStates decreased in the 1990s, there is an alarming con-nection between chancroid and human immunodeficien-\ncyvirus (HIV) infection. HIV causes AIDS (acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome) and is easily spread fromperson to person through chancroid ulcers. Uncircum-cised men with chancroid ulcers have a 48% risk ofacquiring HIV from sexual contact. Women with chan-croid ulcers are also at a greater risk of being infectedwith HIV during sexual contact. Genital ulcers seem toact as doorways for HIV to enter and exit.\nCauses and symptoms\nHaemophilus ducreyi is spread from person to per-\nson by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact. Uncircum-cised men are about three times more likely than circum-cised men to become infected following exposure toHaemophilus ducreyi . Having unprotected sex, exchang-\ning sex for drugs, and having unprotected sex with aprostitute are other risk factors. Many cases of chancroidin the United States occur in persons who had traveled tocountries where the disease is more common.Chancroid occurs when Haemophilus ducreyi pene-\ntrates the skin through an injury, like a scratch or cut.Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, andnutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. The first sign ofchancroid is a small, red papule that occurs within threeto seven days following exposure to the bacteria, but maytake up to one month. Usually within one day, the papulebecomes an ulcer. The chancroid ulcer is painful, bleedseasily, drains a grey or yellowish pus, and has sharplydefined, ragged edges. They can vary in size from aneighth of an inch to two inches in diameter. Men usuallyhave only one ulcer, but women often have four or more.Sometimes “kissing” ulcers occur when one ulcerspreads the bacterial infection to an opposite skin sur-face. For example, kissing ulcers can form on the lips ofthe labia majora. Alternatively, women may not have anyexternal sores but may experience painful urination,intercourse, and/or bowel movements and may have avaginal discharge or rectal bleeding.\nSigns that the infection has spread to the lymph node\nappear about one week after the formation of the genitalulcer. Lymph nodes are small organs in the lymphaticsystem that filter waste materials from nearly everyorgan in the body. This lymph node infection is called“lymphadenitis” and the swollen, painful lymph node iscalled a “bubo.” The bubo, which appears as a red, spher-ical lump, may burst through the skin, releasing a thickpus and forming another ulcer.\nDiagnosis\nChancroid may be diagnosed and treated by urolo-\ngists (urinary tract doctors for men), gynecologists (forwomen), and infectious disease specialists. Part of thediagnosis of chancroid involves ruling out genital herpesand syphilis because genital ulcers are also symptoms ofthese diseases. The appearance of these three diseases\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 729Chancroid\nA close-up view of a chancroid specimen. (Custom Medical\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 729can be close enough to be confusing. However, the pres-\nence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with agenital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid.\nFor a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus\nducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster-\nile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pussample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into specialmedia and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi\ntakes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. Inaddition, the pus may be examined under the microscopeto see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pusmay also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. Ablood sample will probably be taken from the patient’sarm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteriathat causes syphilis.\nTreatment\nThe only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given\neither once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouthfor one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin,Ery-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin),co-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), or ciprofloxacin(Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone(Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, orofloxacin (Floxin).\nThe ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce\nthe swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied tothe ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre-vent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskinmay require circumcision . Pus would be removed from\ninfected lymph nodes by using a needle and syringe.Very large buboes may require surgical drainage.\nPrognosis\nWithout treatment, chancroid may either go away\nquickly or patients may experience the painful ulcers formany months. A complete cure is obtained with antibiotictreatment. Severe ulcers may cause permanent scars.Severe scarring of the foreskin may require circumcision.Urethral fistulas (abnormal passageways from the urinetube to the skin) may occur and requires corrective surgery.KEY TERMS\nBubo —A tender, swollen lymph node in the groin\nthat may follow a chancroid ulcer.\nGroin —The region of the body that lies between\nthe abdomen and the thighs.Prevention\nThe best prevention for chancroid is to use a con-\ndom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be\nprevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual con-tact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with adisease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid,it is important that all sexual contacts of the patient areidentified and treated.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Chancroid.” In The Skin and Infection: A Color Atlas and\nText, ed.

    "title": "Charcoal, activated",
    "content": "Charcoal, activated\nDefinition\nActivated charcoal is a fine, black, odorless, and\ntasteless powder. It is made from wood or other materialsthat have been exposed to very high temperatures in anairless environment. It is then treated, or activated, toincrease its ability to adsorb by reheating with oxidizinggas or other chemicals to break it into a very fine powder.Activated charcoal is pure carbon specially processed tomake it highly adsorbent of particles and gases in thebody’s digestive system.\nActivated charcoal has often been used since ancient\ntimes to cure a variety of ailments including poisoning .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 730Charcoal, activatedGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 730Its healing effects have been well documented since as\nearly as 1550 B.C. by the Egyptians. However, charcoal\nwas almost forgotten until 15 years ago when it wasrediscovered as a wonderful oral agent to treat most over-doses and toxins.\nDescription\nActivated charcoal’s most important use is for treat-\nment of poisoning. It helps prevent the absorption ofmost poisons or drugs by the stomach and intestines. Inaddition to being used for most swallowed poisons inhumans, charcoal has been effectively used in dogs, rab-bits, rats, and other animals, as well. It can also adsorbgas in the bowels and has been used for the treatment ofgas or diarrhea . Charcoal’s other uses such as treatment\nof viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxic byproducts, snakevenoms and other substances by adsorption have notbeen supported by clinical studies. By adding water tothe powder to make a paste, activated charcoal can beused as an external application to alleviate pain and itch-\ningfrom bites and stings .\nPoisons and drug overdoses\nIt is estimated that one million children accidentally\noverdose on drugs mistaken as candies or eat, drink, orinhale poisonous household products each year. Infantsand toddlers are at the greatest risk for accidental poison-ing. Activated charcoal is one of the agents most com-monly used for these cases. It can absorb large amounts ofpoisons quickly. In addition, it is non-toxic, may be storedfor a long time, and can be conveniently administered athome. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxicsubstances in the stomach and intestines. This preventsthe toxic drug or chemical from spreading throughout thebody. The activated charcoal with the toxic substancebound to it is then excreted in the stool without harm tothe body. When poisoning is suspected the local poisoncontrol center should be contacted for instructions. Theymay recommend using activated charcoal, which shouldbe available at home so that it can be given to the poi-soned child or pet immediately. For severe poisoning,several doses of activated charcoal may be needed.\nIntestinal disorders\nIn the past, activated charcoal was a popular remedy\nfor gas. Even before the discovery of America by Euro-peans, Native Americans used powdered charcoal mixedwith water to treat an upset stomach. Now charcoal isbeing rediscovered as an alternative treatment for this con-dition. Activated charcoal works like a sponge. Its hugesurface area is ideal for soaking up different substances,including gas. In one study, people taking activated char-KEY TERMS\nAntidote —A remedy to counteract a poison or\ninjury.\nAdsorption —The binding of a chemical (e.g., drug\nor poison) to a solid material such as activatedcharcoal or clay.\ncoal after eating a meal with high gas-producing foods did\nnot produce more gas than those who did not have thesefoods. Charcoal has also been used to treat other intestinaldisorders such as diarrhea, constipation , and cramps.\nThere are few studies to support these uses and there arealso concerns that frequent use of charcoal may decreaseabsorption of essential nutrients, especially in children.\nOther uses\nBesides being a general antidote for poisons or reme-\ndy for gas, activated charcoal has been used to treat otherconditions as well. Based on its ability to adsorb or bindto other substances, charcoal has been effectively used toclean skin wounds and to adsorb waste materials from the\ngastrointestinal tract. In addition, it has been used toadsorb snake venoms, viruses, bacteria, and harmfulmaterials excreted by bacteria or fungi. However, becauseof lack of scientific studies, these uses are not recom-mended. Activated charcoal, when used together withother remedies such as aloe vera, acidophilus, and psylli-um, helps to keep symptoms of ulcerative colitis under\ncontrol. While charcoal shows some anti-aging activity inrats, it is doubtful if it can do the same for humans.\nRecommended dosage\nFor poisoning\nActivated charcoal is available without prescription.\nHowever, in case of accidental poisoning or drug overdose\nan emergency poison control center, hospital emergencyroom, or doctor’s office should be called for advice. In casethat both syrup of ipecac and charcoal are recommended\nfor treatment of the poison, ipecac should be given first.Charcoal should not be given for at least 30 minutes afteripecac or until vomiting from ipecac stops. Activated char-coal is often mixed with a liquid before being swallowed orput into the tube leading to the stomach. Activated charcoalis available as 1.1 oz (33 ml) liquid bottles. It is also avail-able in 0.5 oz (15 ml) container sizes and as slurry of char-coal pre-mixed in water or as a container in which water orsoda pop is added.

The dosage fortreatment of gas or diarrhea in adults is 520–975 mg aftereach meal and up to 5 g per day.\nPrecautions\nParents should keep activated charcoal on hand in\ncase of emergencies.\nDo not give charcoal together with syrup of ipecac.\nThe charcoal will adsorb the ipecac. Charcoal should betaken 30 minutes after ipecac or after the vomiting fromipecac stops.\nSome activated charcoal products contain sorbitol.\nSorbitol is a sweetener as well as a laxative, therefore, itmay cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. These productsshould not be used in infants.\nCharcoal may interfere with the absorption of med-\nications and nutrients such as vitamins or minerals . For\nuses other than for treatment of poisoning, charcoalshould be taken two hours after other medications.\nCharcoal should not be used to treat poisoning\ncaused by corrosive products such as lye or other strongacids or petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene,or cleaning fluids. Charcoal may make the conditionworse and delay diagnosis and treatment. In addition,charcoal is also not effective if the poison is lithium,cyanide, iron, ethanol, or methanol.\nParents should not mix charcoal with chocolate\nsyrup, sherbet, or ice cream, even though it may makecharcoal taste better. These foods may prevent charcoalfrom working properly.\nActivated charcoal may cause swelling or pain in the\nstomach. A doctor should be notified immediately. It hasbeen known to cause problems in people with intestinalbleeding, blockage or those people who have had recentsurgery. These patients should talk to their doctor beforeusing this product.\nCharcoal may be less effective in people with slow\ndigestion.Charcoal should not be given for more than three or\nfour days for treatment of diarrhea. Continuing forlonger periods may interfere with normal nutrition .\nCharcoal should not be used in children under three\nyears of age to treat diarrhea or gas.\nActivated charcoal should be kept out of reach of\nchildren.\nSide effects\nCharcoal may cause constipation when taken for\noverdose or accidental poisoning. A laxative should betaken after the crisis is over.\nActivated charcoal may cause the stool to turn black.\nThis is to be expected.\nPain or swelling of the stomach may occur.

    "content": "Charcot Marie Tooth disease\nDefinition\nCharcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is the name\nof a group of inherited disorders of the nerves in theperipheral nervous system (nerves throughout the body\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 732Charcot Marie Tooth diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 732that communicate motor and sensory information to and\nfrom the spinal cord) causing weakness and loss of sen-sation in the limbs.\nDescription\nCMT is named for the three neurologists who first\ndescribed the condition in the late 1800s. It is also knownas hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and is some-times called peroneal muscular atrophy, referring to themuscles in the leg that are often affected. The age of onsetof CMT can vary anywhere from young childhood to the50s or 60s. Symptoms typically begin by the age of 20. Forreasons yet unknown, the severity in symptoms can alsovary greatly, even among members of the same family.\nAlthough CMT has been described for many years,\nit is only since the early 1990s that the genetic cause ofmany of the types of CMT have become known. There-fore, knowledge about CMT has increased dramaticallywithin a short time.\nThe peripheral nerves\nCMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of\nnerve cells carrying information to and from the spinalcord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carrymotor commands to muscles, especially those furthestfrom the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As aresult, the muscles connected to these nerves eventuallyweaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carryinformation from the limbs to the brain. Therefore peo-ple with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes symp-toms such as not being able to tell if something is hot orcold or difficulties with balance.\nThere are two parts of the nerve that can be affected\nin CMT. A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, inwhich the wire part is the axon of the nerve and the insu-lation surrounding it is the myelin sheath. The job of themyelin is to help messages travel very fast through thenerves. CMT is usually classified depending on whichpart of the nerve is affected. People who have problemswith the myelin have CMT type 1 and people who haveabnormalities of the axon have CMT type 2.\nSpecialized testing of the nerves, called nerve con-\nduction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine ifa person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure thespeed at which messages travel through the nerves. InCMT1, the messages move too slowly, but in CMT2 themessages travel at the normal speed.\nDemographics\nCMT has been diagnosed in people from all over the\nworld. It occurs in approximately one in 2,500 people,which is about the same incidence as multiple sclerosis . It\nis the most common type of inherited neurologic condition.\nSigns and symptoms\nCMT is caused by changes (mutations) in any one of\na number of genes that carry the instructions to make theperipheral nerves. Genes contain the instructions for howthe body grows and develops before and after a person isborn. There are probably at least 15 different genes thatcan cause CMT. However, as of early 2001, many havenot yet been identified.\nCMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into sub-\ntypes based upon the gene that is causing CMT. The sub-types are labeled by letters, so there is CMT1A, CMT1B,etc. Therefore, the gene with a mutation that causesCMT1A is different from that that causes CMT1B.\nTypes of CMT\nCMT1A. The most common type of CMT is called\nCMT1A. It is caused by a mutation in a gene calledperipheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) located on chro-mosome 17. The job of this gene is to make a protein(PMP22) that makes up part of the myelin. In most peoplewho have CMT, the mutation that causes the condition isa duplication (doubling) of the PMP22 gene. Instead ofhaving two copies of the PMP22 gene (one on each chro-mosome) there are three copies. It is not known how thisextra copy of the PMP22 gene causes the observed symp-toms. A small percentage of people with CMT1A do nothave a duplication of the PMP22 gene, but rather have apoint mutation in the gene. A point mutation is like a typoin the gene that causes it to work incorrectly.\nHEREDITARY NEUROPATHY WITH LIABILITY TO PRES-\nSURE PALSIES (HNPP). HNPP is a condition that is also\ncaused by a mutation in the PMP22 gene. The mutationis a deletion. Therefore, there is only one copy of thePMP22 gene instead of two. People who have HNPPmay have some of the signs of CMT. However, they alsohave episodes where they develop weakness and prob-lems with sensation after compression of certain pressurepoints such as the elbows or knee. Often these symptomswill resolve after a few days or weeks, but sometimesthey are permanent.\nCMT1B. Another type of CMT, called CMT1B, is\ncaused by a mutation in a gene called myelin protein zero(MPZ) located on chromosome 1. The job of this gene isto make the layers of myelin stick together as they arewrapped around the axon. The mutations in this gene arepoint mutations because they involve a change (eitherdeletion, substitution, or insertion) at one specific com-ponent of a gene.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 733Charcot Marie Tooth diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 733CMTX. Another type of CMT, called CMTX, is usu-\nally considered a subtype of CMT1 because it affects themyelin, but it has a different type of inheritance than type1 or type 2. In CMTX, the CMT-causing gene is locatedon the X chromosome and is called connexin 32 (Cx32).The job of this gene is to code for a class of protein calledconnexins that form tunnels between the layers of myelin.\nCMT2. There are at least five different genes that can\ncause CMT type 2. Therefore, CMT2 has subtypes A, B,C, D and E. As of early 2001, scientists have narrowed inon the location of most of the CMT2 causing genes.However, the specific genes and the mutations have notyet been found for most types. Very recently, the gene forCMT2E has been found. The gene is called neurofila-ment-light (NF-L). Because it has just been discovered,not much is known about how mutations in this genecause CMT.\nCMT3. In the past a condition called Dejerine-Sottas\ndisease was referred to as CMT3. This is a severe type ofCMT in which symptoms begin in infancy or early child-hood. It is now known that this is not a separate type ofCMT and in fact people who have onset in infancy orearly childhood often have mutations in the PMP22 orMPZ genes.\nCMT4. CMT4 is a rare type of CMT in which the\nnerve conduction tests have slow response results. Howev-er, it is classified differently from CMT1 because it ispassed through families by a different pattern of inheri-tance. There are five different subtypes and each has onlybeen described in a few families. The symptoms in CMT4are often severe and other symptoms such as deafness maybe present. There are three different genes that have beenassociated with CMT4 as of early 2001. They are calledMTMR2, EGR2, and NDRG1. More research is requiredto understand how mutations in these genes cause CMT.\nInheritance\nCMT1A and 1B, HNPP, and all of the subtypes of\nCMT2 have autosomal dominant inheritance. Autosomalrefers to the first 22 pairs of chromosomes that are thesame in males and females. Therefore, males andfemales are affected equally in these types. In a dominantcondition, only one gene of a pair needs to have a muta-tion in order for a person to have symptoms of the condi-tion. Therefore, anyone who has these types has a 50%,or one in two, chance of passing CMT on to each of theirchildren. This chance is the same for each pregnancy\nand does not change based on previous children.\nCMTX has X-linked inheritance. Since males only\nhave one X chromosome, they only have one copy of theCx32 gene. Thus, when a male has a mutation in his Cx32gene, he will have CMT. However, females have two X\nchromosomes and therefore have two copies of the Cx32gene. If they have a mutation in one copy of their Cx32genes, they will only have mild to moderate symptoms ofCMT that may go unnoticed. This is because their normalcopy of the Cx32 gene does make normal myelin.\nFemales pass on one or the other of their X chromo-\nsomes to their children—sons or daughters. If a womanwith a Cx32 mutation passes her normal X chromosome,she will have an unaffected son or daughter who will notpass CMT on to his or her children. If the woman passesthe chromosome with Cx32 mutation on she will have anaffected son or daughter, although the daughter will bemildly affected or have no symptoms. Therefore, a womanwith a Cx32 mutation has a 50%, or a one in two, chanceof passing the mutation to her children: a son will beaffected, and a daughter may only have mild symptoms.\nWhen males pass on an X chromosome, they have a\ndaughter. When they pass on a Y chromosome, they havea son. Since the Cx32 mutation is on the X chromosome,a man with CMTX will always pass the Cx32 mutationon to his daughters. However, when he has a son, hepasses on the Y chromosome, and therefore the son willnot be affected. Therefore, an affected male passes theCx32 gene mutation on to all of his daughters, but tonone of his sons.\nCMT4 has autosomal recessive inheritance. Males\nand females are equally affected. In order for a person tohave CMT4, they must have a mutation in both of theirCMT-causing genes—one inherited from each parent.The parents of an affected person are called carriers.They have one normal copy of the gene and one copywith a mutation. Carriers do not have symptoms of CMT.Two carrier parents have a 25%, or one in four, chance ofpassing CMT on to each of their children.\nThe onset of symptoms is highly variable, even\namong members of the same family. Symptoms usuallyprogress very slowly over a person’s lifetime. The mainproblems caused by CMT are weakness and loss of sen-sation mainly in the feet and hands. The first symptomsare usually problems with the feet such as high archesand problems with walking and running. Tripping whilewalking and sprained ankles are common. Muscle loss inthe feet and calves leads to “foot drop” where the footdoes not lift high enough off the ground when walking.Complaints of cold legs are common, as are cramps inthe legs, especially after exercise .\nIn many people, the fingers and hands eventually\nbecome affected. Muscle loss in the hands can make finemovements such as working buttons and zippers difficult.Some patients develop tremor in the upper limbs. Loss ofsensation can cause problems such as numbness and the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 734Charcot Marie Tooth diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 734inability to feel if something is hot or cold. Most people\nwith CMT remain able to walk throughout their lives.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological\nexam to determine the extent and distribution of weakness. Athorough family history should be taken at this time to deter-mine if other people in the family are affected. Testing mayalso be performed to rule out other causes of neuropathy.\nA nerve conduction velocity test should be per-\nformed to measure how fast impulses travel through thenerves. This test may show characteristic features ofCMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conductiontesting may be combined with electromyography\n(EMG), an electrical test of the muscles.\nA nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the\nnerve) may be performed to look for changes characteris-tic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic ofCMT and is usually not necessary for making a diagnosis.\nDefinitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet-\nic testing , usually performed by drawing a small amount\nof blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to detectmutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2. However,research is progressing rapidly and new testing is oftenmade available every few months. All affected membersof a family have the same type of CMT. Therefore once amutation is found in one affected member, it is possibleto test other members who may have symptoms or are atrisk of developing CMT.\nPrenatal diagnosis\nTesting during pregnancy to determine whether an\nunborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in afamily has identified a specific CMT-causing mutation.This can be done after 10–12 weeks of pregnancy using aprocedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS\ninvolves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and exam-ining the cells. Testing can also be done by amniocente-\nsisafter 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount\nof the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzingthe cells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a smallrisk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are\ninterested in learning more should check with their doctoror genetic counselor. Couples interested in these optionsshould obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore all\nof the benefits and limitations of these procedures.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for CMT. However, physical and\noccupational therapy are an important part of CMT treat-ment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range of motionand minimize deformity caused by muscle shortening, orcontracture. Braces are sometimes used to improve control\nof the lower extremities that can help tremendously withbalance. After wearing braces, people often find that theyhave more energy because they are using less energy tofocus on their walking. Occupational therapy is used toprovide devices and techniques that can assist tasks suchas dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities ofdaily life. V oice-activated software can also help peoplewho have problems with fine motor control.\nIt is very important that people with CMT avoid\ninjury that causes them to be immobile for long periodsof time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to returnto their original strength after injury.\nThere is a long list of medications that should be\navoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT such ashydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B\n6, and\nD, Taxol, and large intravenous doses of penicillin. Com-plete lists are available from the CMT support groups. Peo-ple considering taking any of these medications shouldweigh the risks and benefits with their physician.\nPrognosis\nThe symptoms of CMT usually progress slowly over\nmany years, but do not usually shorten life expectancy.The majority of people with CMT do not need to use awheelchair during their lifetime. Most people with CMTare able to lead full and productive lives despite theirphysical challenges.\nResources\nBOOKS\nParry, G. J., ed.

Krajewski, MS, CGC\nCharcot’s joints\nDefinition\nCharcot’s joints is a progressive degenerative disease\nof the joints caused by nerve damage resulting in the loss ofability to feel pain in the joint and instability of the joint.\nDescription\nCharcot’s joints, also called neuropathic joint dis-\nease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint.The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint dueto nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to thejoint go unnoticed leading to instability and making thejoint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated smallinjuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until\nfinally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro-tective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegrationof the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint.Although this condition can affect any joint, the\nknee is the joint most commonly involved. In individualswith diabetes mellitus , the foot is most commonly\naffected. The disease can involve only one joint or it mayaffect two or three joints. More than three affected jointsis very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affecteddepends on the location of the nerve damage.\nCauses and symptoms\nMany diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil-\nity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus,spinal injuries and diseases, alcoholism , and even syphilis\ncan all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in someareas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital.\nThe symptoms of Charcot’s joints can go unnoticed\nfor some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis\nin the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint withoutthe expected pain, or with less pain than would beexpected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. Asthe condition progresses, however, the joint can becomevery painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths.\nDiagnosis\nCharcot’s joints is suspected when a person with a\ndisease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painlessswelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays willshow damage to the joint, and may also show abnormalbone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone frag-ments from previous injuries may also be visible.\nTreatment\nIn the early stages of Charcot’s joints, braces to sta-\nbilize the joints can help stop or minimize the damage.When the disease has progressed beyond braces, surgerycan sometimes repair the joint. If the damage is exten-sive, an artificial joint may be necessary.\nPrognosis\nTreatment of the disease causing loss of pain percep-\ntion may help to slow the damage to the joints.\nPrevention\nPreventing or effectively managing the underlying\ndisease can slow or in some cases reverse joint damage,but the condition cannot be prevented.\nResources\nBOOKS\nResnick, Donald.

    "title": "Chelation therapy",
    "content": "Chelation therapy\nDefinition\nChelation therapy is an intravenous treatment\ndesigned to bind heavy metals in the body in order totreat heavy metal toxicity. Proponents claim it also treatscoronary artery disease and other illnesses that may be\nlinked to damage from free radicals (reactive molecules).\nPurpose\nThe benefits of EDTA chelation for the treatment of\nlead poisoning and excessively high calcium levels are\nundisputed. The claims of benefits for those sufferingfrom atherosclerosis , coronary artery disease, and other\ndegenerative diseases are more difficult to prove. Report-ed uses for chelation therapy include treatment of angi-\nna,gangrene , arthritis, multiple sclerosis ,Parkinson’s\ndisease ,psoriasis , and Alzheimer’s disease . Improve-\nment is also claimed for people experiencing diminishedsight, hearing, smell, coordination, and sexual potency.\nDescription\nOrigins\nThe term chelation is from the Greek root word\n“chele,” meaning “claw.” Chelating agents, most com-monly diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), were originallydesigned for industrial applications in the early 1900s. Itwas not until the World War II era that the potential formedical therapy was realized. The initial intent was todevelop antidotes to poison gas and radioactive contami-nants. The need for widespread therapy of this nature didnot materialize, but more practical uses were found forchelation. During the following decade, EDTA chelationtherapy became standard treatment for people sufferingfrom lead poisoning . Patients who had received this\ntreatment claimed to have other health improvementsthat could not be attributed to the lead removal only.Especially notable were comments from those who hadpreviously suffered from intermittent claudication andangina. They reported suffering less pain and fatigue ,\nwith improved endurance, after chelation therapy. Thesereports stimulated further interest in the potential bene-fits of chelation therapy for people suffering from athero-sclerosis and coronary artery disease.\nIf the preparatory examination suggests that there is a\ncondition that could be improved by chelation therapy, andthere is no health reason why it shouldn’t be used, then thetreatment can begin. The patient is generally taken to acomfortable treatment area, sometimes in a group loca-tion, and an intravenous line is started. A solution ofEDTA together with vitamins and minerals tailored for\nthe individual patient is given. Most treatments take threeto four hours, as the infusion must be given slowly in orderto be safe. The number of recommended treatments is usu-ally between 20 and 40. They are given one to three timesa week. Maintenance treatments can then be given at therate of once or twice a month. Maximum benefits arereportedly attained after approximately three months aftera treatment series. The cost of therapy is considerable, butit is a fraction of the cost of an expensive medical proce-dure like cardiac bypass surgery. Intravenous vitamin Cand mercury chelation therapies are also offered.\nPreparations\nA candidate for chelation therapy should initially\nhave a thorough history and physical to define the type andextent of clinical problems. Laboratory tests will be doneto determine whether there are any conditions present thatwould prevent the use of chelation. Patients who have pre-existing hypocalcemia , poor liver or kidney function, con-\ngestive heart failure ,hypoglycemia ,tuberculosis , clot-\nting problems, or potentially allergic conditions are athigher risk for complications from chelation therapy. ADoppler ultrasound may be performed to determine theadequacy of blood flow in different regions of the body.\nPrecautions\nIt is important for people who receive chelation ther-\napy to work with medical personnel who are experiencedin the use of this treatment. Treatment should not beundertaken before a good physical, lifestyle evaluation,history, and any laboratory tests necessary are per-formed. The staff must be forthcoming about test resultsand should answer any questions the patient may have.Evaluation and treatment should be individualized andinvolve assessment of kidney function before each treat-ment with chelation, since the metals bound by theEDTA are excreted through the kidneys.\nAlthough EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like\nmercury, lead, and cadmium, it also binds some essentialnutrients of the body, such as copper, iron, calcium, zinc,and magnesium. Large amounts of zinc are lost duringchelation. Zinc deficiency can cause impaired immunefunction and other harmful effects. Supplements of zincare generally given to patients undergoing chelation, butit is not known whether this is adequate to prevent defi-ciency. Also, chelation therapy does not replace propernutrition ,exercise , and appropriate medications or\nsurgery for specific diseases or conditions.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 737Chelation therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 737Side effects\nSide effects of chelation therapy are reportedly\nunusual, but are occasionally serious. Mild reactions mayinclude, but are not limited to, local irritation at the infu-sion site, skin reactions, nausea, headache ,dizziness ,\nhypoglycemia, fever , leg cramps, or loose bowel move-\nments. Some of the more serious complications reportedhave included hypocalcemia, kidney damage, decreasedclotting ability, anemia, bone marrow damage, insulinshock, thrombophlebitis with embolism , and even rare\ndeaths. However, some doctors feel that the latter groupsof complications occurred before the safer method cur-rently used for chelation therapy was developed.\nResearch and general acceptance\nEDTA chelation is a highly controversial therapy.\nThe treatment is approved by the United States Food andDrug Administration (FDA) for lead poisoning and seri-ously high calcium levels. However, for the treatment ofatherosclerotic heart disease, EDTA chelation therapy isnot endorsed by the American Heart Association (AHA),the FDA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), or theAmerican College of Cardiology. The AHA reports thatthere are no adequate, controlled, published scientificstudies using currently approved scientific methods tosupport this therapy for the treatment of coronary arterydisease. However, a pooled analysis from the results ofover 70 studies showed positive results in all but one.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCassileth, Barrie. The Alternative Medicine Handbook. New\nYork: W. W.

    "title": "Chemonucleolysis",
    "content": "Chemonucleolysis\nDefinition\nChemonucleolysis is a medical procedure that\ninvolves the dissolving of the gelatinous cushioningmaterial in an intervertebral disk by the injection of anenzyme such as chymopapain.\nPurpose\nBetween each vertebra lies a disk of cushioning\nmaterial that keeps the spinal bones from rubbing togeth-er and absorbs some of the shock to the spine from body\nmovements. In the center of the disk is soft, gelatinousmaterial called the nucleus pulposus (NP). The NP is sur-rounded by a tough fibrous coating. Sometimes when theback is injured, this coating can weaken and bulge or tearto allow the NP to ooze out. When this happens, it iscalled a herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), or—in com-mon language—a herniated disk .\nWhen the disk bulges or herniates, it can put pres-\nsure on nerves which originate in the spinal column, andgo to other parts of the body. This causes lower backpain , and/or pain to the hips, legs, arms, shoulders, and\nneck, depending on the location of the herniated disk.Chemonucleolysis uses chymopapain, an enzyme de-rived from papyrus, to dissolve the disk material that has\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 738ChemonucleolysisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 738been displaced because of injury. Herniated disks are the\ncause of only a small proportion of cases of lower backpain, and chemonucleolysis is appropriate for only somecases of HNP.\nChemonucleolysis is a conservative alternative to\ndisk surgery. There are three types of disk injuries. Aprotruded disk is one that is intact but bulging. In anextruded disk, the fibrous wrapper has torn and the NPhas oozed out, but is still connected to the disk. In asequestered disk, a fragment of the NP has broken loosefrom the disk and is free in the spinal canal. Chemonu-cleolysis is effective on protruded and extruded disks,but not on sequestered disk injuries. In the UnitedStates, chymopapain chemonucleolysis is approvedonly for use in the lumbar (lower) spine. In other coun-tries, it has also been used successfully to treat cervical(upper spine) hernias.\nOther indications that a patient is a good candidate\nfor chemonucleolysis instead of surgery include:\n• the patient is 18–50 years of age• leg pain is worse than lower back pain• other conservative treatments have failed• the spot where the herniated disk presses on the nerve\nhas been pinpointed by myelography , computed\ntomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI)\n• the patient wishes to avoid surgery\nPrecautions\nThere are some situations in which chemonucleoly-\nsis should not be performed. Chymopapain is derivedfrom the papaya. About 0.3% of patients are allergic tochymopapain and go into life-threatening shock whenexposed to the enzyme. Chemonucleolysis should not beperformed on patients allergic to chymopapain orpapaya. It also should not be done:\n• when the patient is pregnantKEY TERMS\nChymopapain —An enzyme from the milky white\nfluid of the papaya, used for medical purposes inchemonucleolysis.\nMyelography —An x-ray test that evaluates the\nsubarachnoid space of the spine.\nNucleus pulposus (NP) —an elastic, pulpy mass in\nthe center of each vertebral disk.• if the disk is sequestered\n• if the patient has had several failed back operations\n• if a spinal cord tumor is present\n• if the patient has a neurological disease such as multi-\nple sclerosis\nOther conditions may affect the appropriateness of\nchemonucleolysis, including hypertension ,obesity , dia-\nbetes, and a family history of stroke.\nDescription\nA small gauge needle is placed in the center of the\naffected disk. Chymopapain is introduced into the disk.The patient needs to remain still.\nPreparation\nPatients will need tests such as a myelogram or CT\nscan to pinpoint the herniated disk. Some doctors medicatethe patient 24 hours prior to the operation in order todecrease the chances of post-operative lower back stiffness.\nAftercare\nPatients may feel lower back stiffness, which goes\naway in few weeks.

The death rate for chemonucleolysis is\nonly 0.02%. Complications overall are five to 10 timesless than with conventional surgery, and the failure rate isroughly comparable to the failure rate in conventionaldisk surgery.\nNormal results\nMany patients feel immediate relief from pain, but,\nin about 30% of patients, maximal relief takes six weeks.The long term (seven to 20 years) success rate averagesabout 75%, which is comparable to the success rate forconventional surgery.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nAlexander, Herbert. “Chemonucleolysis for Lumbar Disc Her-\nniation: How Does it Stack up to Other Minimally Inva-sive Approaches?” Journal of Musculoskelatal Medicine\n12, no. 2 (1995): 13-24.\nTish Davidson\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 739ChemonucleolysisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 739Chemotherapy\nDefinition\nChemotherapy is treatment of cancer with anti-\ncancer drugs .\nPurpose\nThe main purpose of chemotherapy is to kill cancer\ncells. It is usually used to treat patients with cancer thathas spread from the place in the body where it started(metastasized). Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells any-where in the body. It even kills cells that have broken offfrom the main tumor and traveled through the blood orlymph systems to other parts of the body.\nChemotherapy can cure some types of cancer. In\nsome cases, it is used to slow the growth of cancer cellsor to keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of thebody. When a cancer has been removed by surgery,chemotherapy may be used to keep the cancer from com-ing back (adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy also can easethe symptoms of cancer, helping some patients to have abetter quality of life.\nPrecautions\nThere are many different types of chemotherapy\ndrugs. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in treatingcancer, determine which drugs are best suited foreach patient. This decision is based on the type ofcancer, the patient’s age and health, and other drugsthe patient is taking. Some patients should not betreated with certain chemotherapy drugs. Age andother conditions may affect the drugs with which aperson may be treated. Heart disease, kidney disease,and diabetes are conditions that may limit the choiceof treatment drugs.\nDescription\nMore than 50 chemotherapy drugs are currently\navailable to treat cancer and many more are being testedfor their ability to destroy cancer cells. Most chemothera-py drugs interfere with the ability of cells to grow or mul-tiply. Although these drugs affect all cells in the body,many useful treatments are most effective against rapidlygrowing cells. Cancer cells grow more quickly than mostother body cells. Other cells that grow fast are cells of thebone marrow that produce blood cells, cells in the stom-ach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. There-fore, the most common side effects of chemotherapy arelinked to their effects on other fast growing cells.Types of chemotherapy drugs\nChemotherapy drugs are classified based on how\nthey work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs aredescribed below:\n• Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking\nDNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos-phamide is an alkylating drug.\n• Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA\nand keep cells from growing and multiplying. Anexample of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).\n• Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural sub-\nstances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere withimportant cell functions, including production of DNAand cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin belong tothis group of chemotherapy drugs.\n• Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally.\nVinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids obtainedfrom the periwinkle plant.\n• Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers that\ndepend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is usedto treat breast cancers that depend on the hormoneestrogen for growth.\nCombination chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is usually given in addition to other\ncancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy .\nWhen given with other treatments, it is called adjuvantchemotherapy. An oncologist decides which chemothera-py drug or combination of drugs will work best for eachpatient. The use of two or more drugs together often worksbetter than a single drug for treating cancer. This is calledcombination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of differentdrug combinations help doctors learn which combinationswork best for each type of cancer.\nHow chemotherapy is given\nChemotherapy is administered in different ways,\ndepending on the drugs to be given and the type of can-cer. Doctors decide the dose of chemotherapy drugs con-sidering many factors, among them being the patient’sheight and weight.\nChemotherapy may be given by one or more of the\nfollowing methods:\n• orally• by injection• through a catheter or port\n• topically\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 740ChemotherapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 740Oral chemotherapy is given by mouth in the form a\npill, capsule, or liquid. This is the easiest method and canusually be done at home.\nIntravenous (IV) chemotherapy is injected into a\nvein. A small needle is inserted into a vein on the hand orlower arm. The needle is usually attached to a small tubecalled a catheter, which delivers the drug to the needlefrom an IV bag or bottle.\nIntramuscular (IM) chemotherapy is injected into a\nmuscle. Chemotherapy given by intramuscular injectionis absorbed into the blood more slowly than IVchemotherapy. Because of this, the effects of IMchemotherapy may last longer than chemotherapy givenintravenously. Chemotherapy may also be injected sub-cutaneously (SQ or SC), which means under the skin.Injection of chemotherapy directly into the cancer iscalled intralesional (IL) injection.\nChemotherapy may also be given by a catheter or\nport permanently inserted into a central vein or body cav-ity. A port is a small reservoir or container that is placedin a vein or under the skin in the area where the drug willbe given. These methods eliminate the need for repeatedinjections and may allow patients to spend less time inthe hospital while receiving chemotherapy. A commonlocation for a permanent catheter is the external jugularvein in the neck. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy isadministered into the abdominal cavity through acatheter or port. Chemotherapy given by catheter or portinto the spinal fluid is called intrathecal (IT) administra-tion. Catheters and ports may also be placed in the chestcavity, bladder, or pelvis, depending on the location ofthe cancer to be treated.\nTopical chemotherapy is given as a cream or oint-\nment applied directly to the cancer. This method is morecommon in treatment of certain types of skin cancer.\nTreatment location and schedule\nPatients may take chemotherapy at home, in the doc-\ntor’s office, or as an inpatient or outpatient at the hospi-tal. Most patients stay in the hospital when first begin-ning chemotherapy, so their doctor can check for anyside effects and change the dose if needed.\nHow often and how long chemotherapy is given\ndepends on the type of cancer, how patients respond tothe drugs, patients’ health and ability to tolerate thedrugs, and the types of drugs given. Chemotherapyadministration may take only a few minutes or may lastas long as several hours. Chemotherapy may be givendaily, weekly, or monthly. A rest period may follow acourse of treatment before the next course begins. Incombination chemotherapy, more than one drug may begiven at a time, or they may be given alternately, one fol-\nlowing the other.\nPreparation\nA number of medical tests are done before\nchemotherapy is started. The oncologist will determinehow much the cancer has spread from the results of xrays and other imaging tests and from samples of thetumor taken during surgery.\nBlood tests give the doctor important information\nabout the function of the blood cells and levels of chemi-cals in the blood. A complete blood count (CBC) is\ncommonly done before and regularly during treatment.The CBC shows the numbers of white blood cells, redblood cells, and platelets in the blood. Becausechemotherapy affects the bone marrow, where bloodcells are made, levels of these cells often drop duringchemotherapy. The white blood cells and platelets aremost likely to be affected by chemotherapy. A drop in the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 741Chemotherapy\nPatient undergoing high dose stem cell chemotherapy.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Low levels of platelets cancause a patient to bleed easily from a cut or other wound.A low red blood cell count can lead to anemia (deficien-cy of red blood cells) and fatigue .\nWhen a chemotherapy treatment takes a long time, the\npatient may prepare for it by wearing comfortable clothes.Bringing a book to read or a tape to listen to may help passthe time and ease the stress of receiving chemotherapy.\nSome patients bring a friend or family member to providecompany and support during treatment.\nSometimes, patients taking chemotherapy drugs\nknown to cause nausea are given medications called anti-emetics before chemotherapy is administered. Anti-emet-ic drugs help to lessen feelings of nausea. Two anti-nau-sea medications that may be used are Kytril and Zofran.\nOther ways to prepare for chemotherapy and help\nlessen nausea are:\n• regularly eat nutritious foods and drink lots of fluids• eat and drink normally until about two hours before\nchemotherapy\n• eat high carbohydrate, low-fat foods and avoid spicy\nfoods\nAftercare\nTips for helping to control side effects after chemo-\ntherapy include:\n• follow any instructions given by the doctor or nurse• take all prescribed medications• eat small amounts of bland foods• drink lots of fluids• get plenty of rest\nSome patients find it helps to breathe fresh air or get\nmild exercise , such as taking a walk.\nRisks\nChemotherapy drugs are toxic to normal cells as\nwell as cancer cells. A dose that will destroy cancer cellswill probably cause damage to some normal cells. Doc-tors adjust doses to do the least amount of harm possibleto normal cells. Some patients feel few or no side effects,and others may have more serious side effects. In somecases, a dose adjustment is all that is needed to reduce orstop a side effect.\nSome chemotherapy drugs have more side effects\nthan others. Some of the most common side effects are:\n•nausea and vomiting• loss of appetite\n• hair loss• anemia and fatigue\n• infection\n• easy bleeding or bruising• sores in the mouth and throat• neuropathy and other damage to the nervous system• kidney damage\nNausea and vomiting are common, but can usually\nbe controlled by taking antinausea drugs , drinking\nenough fluids, and avoiding spicy foods. Loss of appetitemay be due to nausea or the stress of undergoing cancertreatment.\nSome chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss, but it is\nalmost always temporary.\nLow blood cell counts caused by the effect of\nchemotherapy on the bone marrow can lead to anemia,infections, and easy bleeding and bruising. Patients withanemia have too few red blood cells to deliver oxygenand nutrients to the body’s tissues. Anemic patients feeltired and weak. If red blood cell levels fall too low, ablood transfusion may be given.\nPatients receiving chemotherapy are more likely to\nget infections. This happens because their infection-fighting white blood cells are reduced. It is important totake measures to avoid getting infections. When thewhite blood cell count drops too low, the doctor may pre-scribe medications called colony stimulating factors thathelp white blood cells grow. Neupogen and Leukine aretwo colony stimulants used as treatments to help fightinfection.\nPlatelets are blood cells that make the blood clot.\nWhen patients do not have enough platelets, they maybleed or bruise easily, even from small injuries. Patientswith low blood platelets should take precautions to avoidinjuries. Medicines such as aspirin and other pain reliev-\ners can affect platelets and slow down the clotting process.\nChemotherapy can cause irritation and dryness in the\nmouth and throat. Painful sores may form that can bleedand become infected. Precautions to avoid this side effectinclude getting dental care before chemotherapy begins,brushing the teeth and gums regularly with a soft brush,and avoiding mouth washes that contain salt or alcohol.\nNormal results\nThe main goal of chemotherapy is to cure cancer.\nMany cancers are cured by chemotherapy. It may be usedin combination with surgery to keep a cancer from spread-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 742ChemotherapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 742ing to other parts of the body. Some widespread, fast-\ngrowing cancers are more difficult to treat. In these cases,chemotherapy may slow the growth of the cancer cells.\nDoctors can tell if the chemotherapy is working by\nthe results of medical tests. Physical examination , blood\ntests, and x rays are all used to check the effects of treat-ment on the cancer.\nThe possible outcomes of chemotherapy are:\n• Complete remission or response. The cancer complete-\nly disappears. The course of chemotherapy is complet-ed and the patient is tested regularly for a recurrence.\n• Partial remission or response. The cancer shrinks in\nsize but does not disappear. The same chemotherapymay be continued or a different combination of drugsmay be tried.\n• Stabilization. The cancer does not grow or shrink.\nOther therapy options may be explored. A tumor maystay stabilized for many years.\n• Progression. The cancer continues to grow. Other thera-\npy options may be explored.\n• A secondary malignancy may develop from the one\nbeing treated, and that second cancer may need addi-tional chemotherapy or other treatment.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDollinger, Malin, et al.

    "title": "Chest drainage therapy",
    "content": "Chest drainage therapy\nDefinition\nChest drainage therapy involves the removal of air,\nblood, pus, or other secretions from the chest cavity.\nPurpose\nChest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on\nthe lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection.Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer-gency or a planned procedure.\nRemoving air or fluids from the chest involves the\ninsertion of a tube through the skin and the musclesbetween the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity isalso called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube iscalled thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some-times called thoracostomy tube drainage.\nConditions that may need to be treated by chest\ndrainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues\nof the lungs), tuberculosis , and spontaneous pneu-\nmothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more\nthan a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditionsinclude cancer that causes excessive secretions,\nempyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax\n(blood in the thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainagetherapy is done to drain blood from the chest cavityafter lung or heart surgery. In cases where the lung iscollapsed, removing fluids by chest drainage therapyallows the lung to reinflate.\nOftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment\nto determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 743Chest drainage therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 743the pleural space. Sometimes a procedure called thora-\ncentesis is performed in an effort to avoid inserting a\nchest drainage tube. In this procedure a needle with acatheter is inserted into the pleural space and fluid isremoved. When fluid continues to accumulate, chestdrainage therapy is usually the next step. This is especial-ly true when there is a lung infection underlying the fluidbuild-up.\nPrecautions\nChest drainage therapy is not done if a collapsed\nlung is not life-threatening. It also should be avoided forpatients who have blood clotting problems.\nDescription\nMost patients are awake when the chest drainage\ntube is inserted. They are given a sedative and a localanesthetic. Chest drainage tubes are usually insertedbetween the ribs. The exact location depends on the typeof material to be drained and its location in the lungs.\nAn incision is made in the skin and through the mus-\ncles between the ribs. A chest tube is inserted andsecured in place. The doctor connects one end of the tubeto the chest drainage system.\nThe chest drainage system must remain sealed to\nprevent air from entering the chest cavity through thetube. One commonly used system is a water-sealdrainage system, comprised of three compartments thatcollect and drain the fluid or air without allowing air tobackflow into the tube. An alternative to this system is toconnect the tube to a negative suction pump.\nOnce the tube and drainage system are in place, a\nchest x ray is done to confirm that the tube is in the rightlocation, and that it is working.

Air and blood together inthis space is called a pneumohemothorax.necessary to insert more than one tube to drain localized\npockets of fluid that have accumulated.\nPreparation\nA chest x ray is usually done before the chest\ndrainage tube is inserted. Sometimes fluid becomestrapped in isolated spaces in the lung, and it is necessaryto do an ultrasound to determine where to locate thedrainage tube. Computed tomography scans (CT) are\nuseful in locating small pockets of fluids caused by can-cer or tuberculosis.\nAftercare\nNormally after the material has been removed\nfrom the chest cavity and the situation is resolved, thechest drainage tube is removed. In cases where the rea-son for the tube was air in the pleural cavity, the tube isclamped and left in place several hours before it isremoved to make sure no more air is leaking into thespace. If the patient is on mechanical ventilation, thetube is often left in place until a respirator is no longernecessary. Chest drainage therapy is usually done inconjunction with treating the underlying cause of thefluid build-up.\nThe fluid that has been drained is examined for bac-\nterial growth, cancer cells, pus, and blood—to determinethe underlying cause of the condition and appropriatetreatment.\nRisks\nProblems can arise in the insertion of the tube if the\nmembrane lining the chest cavity is thick or if it hasmany adhesions. The tube will not drain correctly if thechest cavity contains blood clots or thick secretions thatare often associated with infections. Excessive bleedingmay occur during the insertion and positioning of thetube. Infection may result from the procedure. Pain is\nalso a common complication.\nNormal results\nThe gas, pus, or blood is drained from the chest cavity,\nand the lungs reinflate or begin to function more efficiently.The site at which the tube was inserted heals normally.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Chest Drainage Therapy.” In Everything You Need to Know\nAbout Medical Treatments.

Chest physi-cal therapy includes postural drainage, chest percussion,chest vibration, turning, deep breathing exercises, andcoughing. It is usually done in conjunction with othertreatments to rid the airways of secretions. These othertreatments include suctioning, nebulizer treatments, andthe administration of expectorant drugs.\nChest physical therapy can be used with newborns,\ninfants, children, and adults. People who benefit fromchest physical therapy exhibit a wide range of problemsthat make it difficult to clear secretions from their lungs.Some people who may receive chest physical therapyinclude people with cystic fibrosis or neuromuscular dis-\neases like Guillain-Barré syndrome , progressive mus-\ncle weakness ( myasthenia gravis ), or tetanus . People\nwith lung diseases such as bronchitis ,pneumonia ,o r\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also ben-efit from chest physical therapy. People who are likely toaspirate their mucous secretions because of diseases suchas cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy also receive\nchest physical therapy, as do some people who arebedridden, confined to a wheelchair, or who cannotbreathe deeply because of postoperative pain .\nPrecautions\nChest physical therapy should not be performed on\npeople with\n• bleeding from the lungs\n• neck or head injuries• fractured ribs• collapsed lungs\n• damaged chest walls• tuberculosis• acute asthma\n• recent heart attack\n• pulmonary embolism• lung abscess\n• active hemorrhage• some spine injuries• recent surgery, open wounds , or burns\nDescription\nChest physical therapy can be performed in a variety\nof settings including critical care units, hospitals, nursinghomes, outpatient clinics, and at the patient’s home.Depending on the circumstances, chest physical therapymay be performed by anyone from a respiratory care ther-apist to a trained member of the patient’s family. Differentpatient conditions warrant different levels of training.\nChest physical therapy consists of a variety of proce-\ndures that are applied depending on the patient’s healthand condition. Hospitalized patients are reevaluated fre-quently to establish which procedures are most effectiveand best tolerated. Patients receiving long term chest phys-ical therapy are reevaluated about every three months.\nTurning\nTurning from side to side permits lung expansion.\nPatients may turn themselves or be turned by a caregiver.The head of the bed is also elevated to promote drainageif the patient can tolerate this position. Critically illpatients and those dependent on mechanical respirationare turned once every one to two hours around the clock.\nCoughing\nCoughing helps break up secretions in the lungs so\nthat the mucus can be suctioned out or expectorated.Patients sit upright and inhale deeply through the nose.They then exhale in short puffs or coughs. Coughing isrepeated several times a day.\nDeep breathing\nDeep breathing helps expand the lungs and forces\nbetter distribution of the air into all sections of the lung.The patient either sits in a chair or sits upright in bed andinhales, pushing the abdomen out to force maximumamounts of air into the lung.

    "content": "Chest x ray\nDefinition\nA chest x ray is a procedure used to evaluate organs\nand structures within the chest for symptoms of disease.Chest x rays include views of the lungs, heart, small por-tions of the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and thebones of the chest area. X rays are a form of radiationthat can penetrate the body and produce an image on anx-ray film. Another name for x ray is radiograph.\nPurpose\nChest x rays are ordered for a wide variety of diag-\nnostic purposes. In fact, this is probably the most frequent-ly performed x ray. In some cases, chest x rays are orderedfor a single check of an organ’s condition, and at othertimes, serial x rays are ordered to compare to previousstudies. Some common reasons for chest x rays include:\nPulmonary disorders\nChest films are frequently ordered to diagnose or\nrule out pneumonia . Other pulmonary disorders such as\nemphysema or pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in\nthe chest cavity outside the lungs) may be detected orevaluated through the use of chest x ray.\nCancer\nA chest x ray may be ordered by a physician to\ncheck for possible tumors of the lungs, thyroid, lymphoidtissue, or bones of the thorax. These may be primarytumors. X rays also check for secondary spread of can-\ncerfrom one organ to another.\nCardiac disorders\nWhile less sensitive than echocardiography , chest x\nray can be used to check for disorders such as congestiveheart failure or pulmonary edema .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 747Chest x ray\nA normal chest x ray of a child.

Often thechest x ray is also used to verify correct placement ofchest tubes or catheters.KEY TERMS\nBronchi —Plural of bronchus. The air passages in\nthe lungs through which inhaled air passes on itsway to the lungs.\nDiaphragm —The large muscle that is located\nbetween the abdomen and the chest area. Thediaphragm aids in breathing.\nGastrointestinal —The digestive organs and struc-\ntures, including the stomach and intestines.\nInterstitial lung disease —About 180 diseases fall\ninto this category of breathing disorders. Injury orforeign substances in the lungs, (such as asbestosfibers) as well as infections, cancers, or inheriteddisorders may cause the diseases. They can lead tobreathing or heart failure.\nLymphoid —Tissues relating to the lymphatic sys-\ntem. A thin, yellowish fluid, called lymph fluid,travels throughout the body.

X rays canpenetrate most structures.Precautions\nPregnant women, particularly those in the first or\nsecond trimester, should not have chest x rays unlessabsolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women whoare, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a protec-tive lead apron. Because the procedure involves radia-tion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure,particularly for children. However, the amount of radia-tion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal.\nDescription\nRoutine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal\nview (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat-eral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand forthis exam, particularly when studying collection of fluidin the lungs.\nDuring the actual time of exposure, the technologist\nwill ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is veryimportant in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is nomotion that could detract from the quality and sharpnessof the film image. The procedure will only take a fewminutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is amatter of a few seconds.\nThe chest x ray may be performed in a physician’s\noffice or referred to an outpatient radiology facility orhospital radiology department. In some cases, particular-ly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may betaken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer qualitythan those taken with permanent equipment, but are thebest choice for some patients or situations. Bedriddenpatients may be placed in as upright a position as possi-ble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid.\nPreparation\nThere is no advance preparation necessary for chest\nx rays. Once the patient arrives at the exam area, a hospi-tal gown will replace all clothing on the upper body andall jewelry must be removed.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is required by patients who have chest x\nrays.\nRisks\nThe only risk associated with chest x ray is minimal\nexposure to radiation, particularly for pregnant womenand children. Those patients should use protective leadaprons during the procedure. Technologists are cautionedto carefully check possible dislodging of any tubes or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 748Chest x rayGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 748monitors in the chest area from the patient’s placement\nduring the exam.\nNormal results\nA radiologist, or physician specially trained in the\ntechnique and interpretation of x rays, will evaluate theresults. A normal chest x ray will show normal structuresfor the age and medical history or the patient. Findings,whether normal or abnormal, will be provided to thereferring physician in the form of a written report.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal findings on chest x rays are used in con-\njunction with a physician’s physical exam findings,patient medical history and other diagnostic tests to reacha final diagnosis. For many diseases, chest x rays aremore effective when compared to previous chest studies.The patient is asked to help the radiology facility inlocating previous chest radiographs from other facilities.\nPulmonary disorders\nPneumonia shows up on radiographs as patches and\nirregular areas of density (from fluid in the lungs). If thebronchi, which are usually not visible, can be seen, adiagnosis of bronchial pneumonia may be made. Shifts orshadows in the hila (lung roots) may indicate emphysemaor a pulmonary abscess . Widening of the spaces between\nribs suggests emphysema. Other pulmonary diseases mayalso be detected or suspected through chest x ray.\nCancer\nIn nearly all patients with lung cancer, some sort of\nabnormality can be seen on a chest radiograph. Hilarmasses (enlargements at that part of the lungs where ves-sels and nerves enter) are one of the more commonsymptoms as are abnormal masses and fluid buildup onthe outside surface of the lungs or surrounding areas.Interstitial lung disease, which is a large category of dis-orders, many of which are related to exposure of sub-stances (such as asbestos fibers), may be detected on achest x ray as fiberlike deposits, often in the lower por-tions of the lungs.\nOther\nCongestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases\nmay be indicated on the view of a heart and lung in achest radiograph. Fractures of the sternum and ribs are\nusually easily detected as breaks on the chest x ray. Insome instances, the radiologist’s view of the diaphragmmay indicate an abdominal problem. Tuberculosis canalso be indicated by elevation of the diaphragm. Foreign\nbodies which may have been swallowed or inhaled canusually be located by the radiologist as they will look dif-ferent from any other tissue or structure in the chest. Ser-ial chest x rays may be ordered to track changes over aperiod of time.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Lung Association. 1740 Broadway, New York, NY\n10019.

    "title": "Chickenpox",
    "content": "Chickenpox\nDefinition\nChickenpox (also called varicella) is a common and\nextremely infectious childhood disease that also affectsadults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash thattypically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa-nied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of\nchickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunityagainst the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken-pox are easily recognized and in most cases merelyunpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almostalways be carried out at home. Severe complications candevelop, however, and professional medical attention isessential in some circumstances.\nDescription\nBefore the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released\nfor use in 1995, virtually all of the four million childrenborn each year in the United States contracted chicken-pox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari-cella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family),which is spread through the air or by direct contact withan infected person. Once someone has been infected withthe virus, an incubation period of about 10–21 days pass-es before symptoms begin. The period during whichinfected people are able to spread the disease is believedto start one or two days before the rash breaks out and tocontinue until all the blisters have formed scabs, whichusually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 749ChickenpoxGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 749out but may be longer in adolescents and adults. For this\nreason, doctors recommend keeping children with chick-enpox away from school for about a week. It is not nec-essary, however, to wait until all the scabs have fallen off.\nChickenpox has been a typical part of growing up for\nmost children in the industrialized world (although thismay change if the new varicella vaccine becomes morewidely accepted). The disease can strike at any age, butby ages nine or 10 about 80–90% of American childrenhave already been infected. U.S. children living in ruralareas and many foreign-born children are less likely to beimmune. Because almost every case of chickenpox, nomatter how mild, leads to lifelong protection against fur-ther attacks, adults account for less than 5% of all cases inthe United States. Study results reported by the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate thatmore than 90% of American adults are immune to thechickenpox virus. Adults, however, are much more likelythan children to suffer dangerous complications. Morethan half of all chickenpox deaths occur among adults.\nCauses and symptoms\nA case of chickenpox usually starts without warning\nor with only a mild fever and a slight feeling of unwellness.Within a few hours or days small red spots begin to appearon the scalp, neck, or upper half of the trunk. After a further12–24 hours the spots typically become itchy, fluid-filledbumps called vesicles, which continue to appear in cropsfor the next two to five days. In any area of skin, lesions ofa variety of stages can be seen. These blisters can spread tocover much of the skin, and in some cases may also befound inside the mouth, nose, ears, vagina, or rectum.Some people develop only a few blisters, but in most casesthe number reaches 250–500. The blisters soon begin toform scabs and fall off. Scarring usually does not occurunless the blisters have been scratched and become infect-ed. Occasionally a minor and temporary darkening of theskin (called hyperpigmentation ) is noticed around some\nof the blisters. The degree of itchiness can range from bare-ly noticeable to extreme. Some chickenpox sufferers alsohave headaches, abdominal pain, or a fever. Full recovery\nusually takes five to 10 days after the first symptomsappear. Again, the most severe cases of the disease tend tobe found among older children and adults.\nAlthough for most people chickenpox is no more\nthan a matter of a few days’ discomfort, some groups areat risk for developing complications, the most commonof which are bacterial infections of the blisters, pneumo-\nnia,dehydration ,encephalitis , and hepatitis:\n• Infants. Complications occur much more often among\nchildren less than one year old than among older chil-dren. The threat is greatest to newborns, who are moreat risk of death from chickenpox than any other group.\nUnder certain circumstances, children born to motherswho contract chickenpox just prior to delivery face anincreased possibility of dangerous consequences,including brain damage and death. If the infectionoccurs during early pregnancy , there is a small (less\nthan 5%) risk of congenital abnormalities.\n• Immunocompromised children. Children whose\nimmune systems have been weakened by a genetic dis-order, disease, or medical treatment usually experiencethe most severe symptoms of any group. They have thesecond-highest rate of death from chickenpox.\n• Adults and children 15 and older. Among this group,\nthe typical symptoms of chickenpox tend to strike withgreater force, and the risk of complications is muchhigher than among young children.\nImmediate medical help should always be sought\nwhen anyone in these high-risk groups contracts the dis-ease.\nDiagnosis\nWhere children are concerned, especially those with\nrecent exposure to the disease, diagnosis can usually bemade at home, by a school nurse, or by a doctor over thetelephone if the child’s parent or caregiver is unsure thatthe disease is chickenpox.\nA doctor should be called immediately if:\n• The child’s fever goes above 102°F (38.9°C) or takes\nmore than four days to disappear.\n• The child’s blisters appear infected. Signs of infection\ninclude leakage of pus from the blisters or excessiveredness, warmth, tenderness, or swelling around theblisters.\n• The child seems nervous, confused, unresponsive, or\nunusually sleepy; complains of a stiff neck or severeheadache ; shows signs of poor balance or has trouble\nwalking; finds bright lights hard to look at; is havingbreathing problems or is coughing a lot; is complainingof chest pain; is vomiting repeatedly; or is having con-vulsions. These may be signs of Reye’s syndrome or\nencephalitis, two rare but potentially very dangerousconditions.\nTreatment\nWith children, treatment usually takes place in the\nhome and focuses on reducing discomfort and fever.Because chickenpox is a viral disease, antibiotics are\nineffective against it.\nApplying wet compresses or bathing the child in cool\nor lukewarm water once a day can help the itch. Adding\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 750ChickenpoxGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:10 PM  Page 750four to eight ounces of baking soda or one or two cups of\noatmeal to the bath is a good idea (oatmeal bath packetsare sold by pharmacies). Only mild soap should be usedin the bath. Patting, not rubbing, is recommended for dry-ing the child off, to prevent irritating the blisters.Calamine lotion (and some other kinds of lotions) alsohelp to reduce itchiness. Because scratching can causeblisters to become infected and lead to scarring, thechild’s nails should be cut short. Of course, older childrenneed to be warned not to scratch. For babies, light mittensor socks on the hands can help guard against scratching.\nIf mouth blisters make eating or drinking an\nunpleasant experience, cold drinks and soft, bland foodscan ease the child’s discomfort. Painful genital blisterscan be treated with an anesthetic cream recommended bya doctor or pharmacist. Antibiotics are often prescribed ifblisters become infected.\nFever and discomfort can be reduced by aceta-\nminophen or another medication that does not contain\naspirin . Aspirin and any medications that contain\naspirin or other salicylates must not be used with chick-enpox, for they appear to increase the chances of devel-oping Reye’s syndrome. The best idea is to consult a doc-\ntor or pharmacist if one is unsure about which medica-tions are safe.\nImmunocompromised chickenpox sufferers are\nsometimes given an antiviral drug called acyclovir (Zovi-rax). Studies have shown that Zovirax also lessens thesymptoms of otherwise healthy children and adults whocontract chickenpox, but the suggestion that it should beused to treat the disease among the general population,especially in children, is controversial.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative practitioners seek to lessen the discom-\nfort and fever caused by chickenpox. Like other practi-tioners, they suggest cool or lukewarm baths. Rolled oats(Avena sativa ) in the bath water help relieve itching .\n(Place oats in a sock, run the bath, turn the sock torelease the milky anti-itch properties.) Other recom-mended remedies for itching include applying aloe vera,witch hazel, or herbal preparations of rosemary ( Rosmar-\ninus officinalis ) and calendula ( Calendual officinalis ) to\nthe blisters. Homeopathic remedies are selected on a caseby case basis. Some common remedy choices are tartaremetic (antimonium tartaricum), windflower (pulsatilla),poison ivy ( Rhus toxicodendron ), and sulphur.\nPrognosis\nMost cases of chickenpox run their course within a\nweek without causing lasting harm. However, there isone long-term consequence of chickenpox that strikes\nabout 20% of the population, particularly people 50 andolder. Like all herpes viruses, the varicella-zoster virusnever leaves the body after an episode of chickenpox, butlies dormant in the nerve cells, where it may be reactivat-ed years later by disease or age-related weakening of theimmune system. The result is shingles (also called her-\npes zoster), a very painful nerve inflammation, accompa-nied by a rash, that usually affects the trunk or the facefor 10 days or more. Especially in the elderly, pain,called postherpetic neuralgia , may persist at the site of\nthe shingles for months or years. As of 1998, two newerdrugs for treatment of shingles are available. Both vala-cyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir) stop thereplication of herpes zoster when administered within 72hours of appearance of the rash. The effectiveness ofthese two drugs in immunocompromised patients has not\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 751Chickenpox\nA five-year-old girl with chickenpox.The first symptom of\nthe disease is the rash that is evident on the girl’s back andneck.The rash and the mild fever that accompanies itshould disappear in a week or two.

It is administered by injection within96 hours of known or suspected exposure to the dis-ease and is not useful after that. VZIG is produced as agamma globulin from blood of recently infected indi-viduals.\nA vaccine for chickenpox became available in the\nUnited States in 1995 under the name Varivax. Varivaxis a live, attenuated (weakened) virus vaccine. It hasbeen proven to be 85% effective for preventing all casesof chickenpox and close to 100% effective in prevent-ing severe cases. Side effects are normally limited tooccasional soreness or redness at the injection site.CDC guidelines state that the vaccine should be givento all children (with the exception of certain high-riskgroups) at 12–18 months of age, preferably when theyKEY TERMS\nAcetaminophen —A drug for relieving pain and\nfever.

For older\nchildren, up to age 12, the CDC recommends vaccina-\ntion when a reliable determination that the child in\nquestion has already had chickenpox cannot be made.Vaccination is also recommended for any older child oradult considered susceptible to the disease, particularlythose, such as health care workers and women of child-bearing age, who face a greater likelihood of severe ill-ness or transmitting infection. A single dose of the vac-cine is sufficient for children up to age 12; older chil-dren and adults receive a second dose four to eightweeks later. In 1997 the cost of two adult doses of thevaccine in the United States was about $80. Althoughthis cost was not always covered by health insuranceplans, children up to age 18 without access to theappropriate coverage could be vaccinated free of chargethrough the federal Vaccines for Children program.Varivax is not given to patients who already have overtsigns of the disease. The vaccine is also not recom-mended for those women who are pregnant, or theyshould delay pregnancy for three months following acomplete vaccination. The vaccine is useful when givenearly after exposure to chickenpox and, if given in themidst of the incubation period, it can be preventative.The Infectious Diseases Society of America stated in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 752ChickenpoxGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 7522000 that immunization is recommended for all adults\nwho have never had chickenpox.\nWhile there was initial concern regarding the vac-\ncine’s safety and effectiveness when first released, thevaccination is gaining acceptance as numerous statesrequire it for admittance into day care or public school.In 2000, 59% of toddlers in the United States wereimmunized; up from 43.2% in 1998. A study publishedin 2001 indicates that the varicella vaccine is highlyeffective when used in clinical practice. Although evi-dence has not ruled out a booster shot later in life, allresearch addressing the vaccine’s effectiveness through-out its six-year use indicates that chickenpox may bethe first human herpesvirus to be wiped out.

    "title": "Beth KapesChild abuse",
    "content": "Beth KapesChild abuse\nDefinition\nChild abuse is the blanket term for four types of\nchild mistreatment: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emo-tional abuse, and neglect. In many cases children are thevictims of more than one type of abuse. The abusers canbe parents or other family members, caretakers such asteachers and babysitters, acquaintances (including otherchildren), and (in rare instances) strangers.\nDescription\nPrevalence of abuse\nChild abuse was once viewed as a minor social prob-\nlem affecting only a handful of United States children.However, in recent years it has received close attention fromthe media, law enforcement, and the helping professions,and with increased public and professional awareness hascome a sharp rise in the number of reported cases. Butbecause abuse is often hidden from view and its victims tooyoung or fearful to speak out, experts suggest that its trueprevalence is possibly much greater than the official dataindicate. In 1996, more than three million victims of allegedabuse were reported to child protective services (CPS) agen-cies in the United States, and the reports were substantiatedin more than one million cases. Put another way, 1.5% ofthe country’s children were confirmed victims of abuse in1996. Parents were the abusers in 77% of the confirmedcases, other relatives in 11%. Sexual abuse was more likelyto be committed by males, whereas females were responsi-ble for the majority of neglect cases. More than 1,000 Unit-ed States children died from abuse in 1996.\nAlthough experts are quick to point out that abuse\noccurs among all social, ethnic, and income groups,reported cases usually involve poor families with littleeducation. Young mothers, single-parent families, andparental alcohol or drug abuse are also common in report-ed cases. Charles F. Johnson remarks, “More than 90% ofabusing parents have neither psychotic nor criminal per-sonalities. Rather they tend to be lonely, unhappy, angry,young, and single parents who do not plan their pregnan-cies, have little or no knowledge of child development, andhave unrealistic expectations for child behavior.” About10%, or perhaps as many as 40%, of abusive parents werethemselves physically abused as children, but most abusedchildren do not grow up to be abusive parents.\nTypes of abuse\nPHYSICAL ABUSE. Physical abuse is the nonacciden-\ntal infliction of physical injury to a child. The abuser is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 753Child abuseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 753usually a family member or other caretaker, and is more\nlikely to be male. In 1996, 24% of the confirmed cases ofUnited States child abuse involved physical abuse.\nA rare form of physical abuse is Munchausen syn-\ndrome by proxy, in which a caretaker (most often the\nmother) seeks attention by making the child sick orappear to be sick.\nSEXUAL ABUSE. Charles F. Johnson defines child\nsexual abuse as “any activity with a child, before the ageof legal consent, that is for the sexual gratification of anadult or a significantly older child.” It includes, amongother things, sexual touching and penetration, persuadinga child to expose his or her sexual organs, and allowing achild to view pornography. In most cases the child isrelated to or knows the abuser, and about one in fiveabusers are themselves underage. Sexual abuse was pre-sent in 12% of the confirmed 1996 abuse cases. An esti-mated 20–25% of females and 10–15% of males reportthat they were sexually abused by age 18.\nEMOTIONAL ABUSE. Emotional abuse, according to\nRichard D. Krugman, “has been defined as the rejection,ignoring, criticizing, isolation , or terrorizing of children,\nall of which have the effect of eroding their self-esteem.”Emotional abuse usually expresses itself in verbal attacksinvolving rejection, scapegoating, belittlement, and soforth. Because it often accompanies other types of abuseand is difficult to prove, it is rarely reported, andaccounted for only 6% of the confirmed 1996 cases.\nNEGLECT. Neglect—failure to satisfy a child’s basic\nneeds—can assume many forms. Physical neglect is thefailure (beyond the constraints imposed by poverty) toprovide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision.Emotional neglect is the failure to satisfy a child’s nor-mal emotional needs, or behavior that damages a child’snormal emotional and psychological development (suchas permitting drug abuse in the home). Failing to see thata child receives proper schooling or medical care is alsoconsidered neglect. In 1996 neglect was the finding in52% of the confirmed abuse cases.\nCauses and symptoms\nPhysical abuse\nThe usual physical abuse scenario involves a parent\nwho loses control and lashes out at a child. The triggermay be normal child behavior such as crying or dirtyinga diaper. Unlike nonabusive parents, who may becomeangry at or upset with their children from time to timebut are genuinely loving, abusive parents tend to harbordeep-rooted negative feelings toward their children.\nUnexplained or suspicious bruises or other marks\non the skin are typical signs of physical abuse, as areburns . Skull and other bone fractures are often seen\nin young abused children, and in fact, head injuries arethe leading cause of death from abuse. Children less\nthan one year old are particularly vulnerable to injuryfrom shaking. This is called shaken baby syndrome\nor shaken impact syndrome. Not surprisingly, physicalabuse also causes a wide variety of behavioral changesin children.\nSexual abuse\nJohn M. Leventhal observes, “The two prerequisites\nfor this form of maltreatment include sexual arousal tochildren and the willingness to act on this arousal. Fac-tors that may contribute to this willingness include alco-hol or drug abuse, poor impulse control, and a belief thatthe sexual behaviors are acceptable and not harmful tothe child.” The chances of abuse are higher if the child isdevelopmentally handicapped or vulnerable in someother way.\nGenital or anal injuries or abnormalities (including\nthe presence of sexually transmitted diseases ) can be\nsigns of sexual abuse, but often there is no physical evi-dence for a doctor to find. In fact, physical examinationsof children in cases of suspected sexual abuse supplygrounds for further suspicion only 15–20% of the time.Anxiety , poor academic performance, and suicidal con-\nduct are some of the behavioral signs of sexual abuse, butare also found in children suffering other kinds of stress .\nExcessive masturbation and other unusually sexualizedkinds of behavior are more closely associated with sexu-al abuse itself.\nEmotional abuse\nEmotional abuse can happen in many settings: at\nhome, at school, on sports teams, and so on. Some of thepossible symptoms include loss of self-esteem, sleep dis-turbances, headaches or stomachaches, school avoid-ance, and running away from home.\nNeglect\nMany cases of neglect occur because the parent\nexperiences strong negative feelings toward the child.At other times, the parent may truly care about thechild, but lack the ability or strength to adequately pro-vide for the child’s needs because he or she is handi-capped by depression, drug abuse, mental retardation ,\nor some other problem.\nNeglected children often do not receive adequate\nnourishment or emotional and mental stimulation. As aresult, their physical, social, emotional, and mentaldevelopment is hindered. They may, for instance, be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 754Child abuseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 754underweight, develop language skills less quickly than\nother children, and seem emotionally needy.\nDiagnosis\nDoctors and many other professionals who work\nwith children are required by law to report suspectedabuse to their state’s Child Protective Services (CPS)agency. Abuse investigations are often a group effortinvolving medical personnel, social workers, police\nofficers, and others. Some hospitals and communitiesmaintain child protection teams that respond to casesof possible abuse. Careful questioning of the parentsis crucial, as is interviewing the child (if he or she iscapable of being interviewed). The investigatorsmust ensure, however, that their questioning does notfurther traumatize the child.

Ifthe child does not require hospital treatment, protectionoften involves placing him or her with relatives or in fos-ter care. Once the immediate concerns are dealt with, itbecomes essential to determine how the child’s long-term medical, psychological, educational, and otherneeds can best be met, a process that involves evaluatingnot only the child’s needs but also the family’s (such asfor drug abuse counseling or parental skills training). Ifthe child has brothers or sisters, the authorities mustdetermine whether they have been abused as well. Oninvestigation, signs of physical abuse are discovered inabout 20% of the brothers and sisters of abused children.\nPrognosis\nChild abuse can have lifelong consequences.\nResearch shows that abused children and adolescents aremore likely, for instance, to do poorly in school, sufferemotional problems, develop an antisocial personality,become promiscuous, abuse drugs and alcohol, andattempt suicide. As adults they often have trouble estab-lishing intimate relationships. Whether professional treat-ment is able to moderate the long-term psychologicaleffects of abuse is a question that remains unanswered.\nPrevention\nGovernment efforts to prevent abuse include home-\nvisitor programs aimed at high-risk families and school-based efforts to teach children how to respond to attempt-ed sexual abuse. Emotional abuse prevention has beenpromoted through the media.\nWhen children reach age three, parents should begin\nteaching them about “bad touches” and about confidingin a suitable adult if they are touched or treated in a waythat makes them uneasy. Parents also need to exercisecaution in hiring babysitters and other caretakers. Any-one who suspects abuse should immediately report thosesuspicions to the police or his or her local CPS agency,which will usually be listed in the blue pages of the tele-phone book under Rehabilitative Services or Child andFamily Services, or in the yellow pages. Round-the-clock crisis counseling for children and adults is offeredby the Childhelp USA/IOF Foresters National ChildAbuse Hotline. The National Committee to Prevent ChildAbuse is an excellent source of information on the manysupport groups and other organizations that help abused\nand at-risk children and their families.

    "title": "Childbirth",
    "content": "Childbirth\nDefinition\nChildbirth includes both labor (the process of birth)\nand delivery (the birth itself); it refers to the entireprocess as an infant makes its way from the womb downthe birth canal to the outside world.\nDescription\nChildbirth usually begins spontaneously, following\nabout 280 days after conception, but it may be started byartificial means if the pregnancy continues past 42\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 756ChildbirthGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 756weeks gestation. The average length of labor is about 14\nhours for a first pregnancy and about eight hours in sub-sequent pregnancies. However, many women experiencea much longer or shorter labor.\nLabor can be described in terms of a series of phases.\nFirst stage of labor\nDuring the first phase of labor, the cervix dilates\n(opens) from 0–10 cm. This phase has an early, or latent,phase and an active phase. During the latent phase,progress is usually very slow. It may take quite a whileand many contractions before the cervix dilates the firstfew centimeters. Contractions increase in strength aslabor progresses. Most women are relatively comfortableduring the latent phase and walking around is encour-aged, since it naturally stimulates the process.\nAs labor begins, the muscular wall of the uterus\nbegins to contract as the cervix relaxes and expands. As aportion of the amniotic sac surrounding the baby is pushedinto the opening, it bursts under the pressure, releasingamniotic fluid. This is called “breaking the bag of waters.”\nDuring a contraction, the infant experiences intense\npressure that pushes it against the cervix, eventually forc-ing the cervix to stretch open. At the same time, the con-tractions cause the cervix to thin. During this first stage, awoman’s contractions occur more and more often and lastlonger and longer. The doctor or nurse will do a periodicpelvic exam to determine how the mother is progressing.\nIf the contractions aren’t forceful enough to open thecervix, a drug may be given to make the uterus contract.\nAs pain and discomfort increase, women may be\ntempted to request pain medication. If possible, though,administration of pain medication or anesthetics shouldbe delayed until the active phase of labor begins—atwhich point the medication will not act to slow down orstop the labor.\nThe active stage of labor is faster and more efficient\nthan the latent phase. In this phase, contractions arelonger and more regular, usually occurring about everytwo minutes. These stronger contractions are also morepainful. Women who use the breathing exercises learnedin childbirth classes find that these can help cope withthe pain experienced during this phase. Many womenalso receive some pain medication at this point—either ashort-term medication, such as Nubain or Numorphan, oran epidural anesthesia.\nAs the cervix dilates to 8–9 cm, the phase called the\ntransition begins. This refers to the transition from thefirst phase (during which the cervix dilates from 0–10cm) and the second phase (during which the baby ispushed out through the birth canal). As the baby’s headbegins to descend, women begin to feel the urge to\n“push” or bear down. Active pushing by the mothershould not begin until the second phase, since pushingtoo early can cause the cervix to swell or to tear andbleed. The attending healthcare practitioner should coun-sel the mother on when to begin to push.\nSecond stage of labor\nAs the mother enters the second stage of labor, her\nbaby’s head appears at the top of the cervix. Uterine con-tractions get stronger. The infant passes down the vagina,helped along by contractions of the abdominal musclesand the mother’s pushing. Active pushing by the motheris very important during this phase of labor. If an epidur-al anesthetic is being used, many practitioners recom-mend decreasing the amount administered during thisphase of labor so that the mother has better control overher abdominal muscles.\nWhen the top of the baby’s head appears at the open-\ning of the vagina, the birth is nearing completion. Firstthe head passes under the pubic bone. It fills the lowervagina and stretches the perineum (the tissues betweenthe vagina and the rectum). This position is called“crowning,” since only the crown of the head is visible.When the entire head is out, the shoulders follow. Theattending practitioner suctions the baby’s mouth andnose to ease the baby’s first breath. The rest of the babyusually slips out easily, and the umbilical cord is cut.\nEpisiotomy\nAs the baby’s head appears, the perineum may\nstretch so tight that the baby’s progress is slowed down. Ifthere is risk of tearing the mother’s skin, the doctor maychoose to make a small incision into the perineum to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 757Childbirth\nPlacenta\nUterusUmbilical cord\nVagina\nCervix\nStage 1: Dilation of the cervix\nStage 1: Dilation of the cervix. (Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 757enlarge the vaginal opening. This is called an episiotomy .\nIf the woman has not had an epidural or pudendal block,she will get a local anesthetic to numb the area. Once theepisiotomy is made, the baby is born with a few pushes.\nThird stage\nIn the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed out\nof the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. Theplacenta is pancake shaped and about 10 inches in diam-eter. It has been attached to the wall of the uterus and hasserved to convey nourishment from the mother to thefetus throughout the pregnancy. Continuing uterine con-tractions cause it to separate from the uterus at this point.It is important that all of the placenta be removed fromthe uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normalafter delivery may be much heavier.\nBreech presentation\nApproximately 4% of babies are in what is called\nthe “breech” position when labor begins. In breech pre-sentation, the baby’s head is not the part pressing againstthe cervix. Instead the baby’s bottom or legs are posi-tioned to enter the birth canal instead of the head. Anobstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to a head downposition using a technique called version. This is onlysuccessful approximately half the time.\nThe risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation\nare much higher than with a head-first presentation and themother and attending practitioner will need to weigh therisks and make a decision on whether to deliver via acesarean section or attempt a vaginal birth. The extent of\nthe risk depends to a great extent on the type of breech pre-sentation—of which there are three. Frank breech (thebaby’s legs are folded up against its body) is the most com-mon and the safest for vaginal delivery. The other types arecomplete breech (in which the baby’s legs are crossed\nunder and in front of the body) and footling breech (inwhich one leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birthcanal) are not considered safe to attempt vaginal delivery.\nEven in complete breech, other factors should be\nmet before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasoundexamination should be done to be sure the baby does nothave an unusually large head and that the head is tiltedforward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetalmonitoring and close observation of the progress of laborare also important. A slowing of labor or any indicationof difficulty in the body passing through the pelvisshould be an indication that it is safer to consider acesarean section.\nForceps delivery\nIf the labor is not progressing as it should or if the\nbaby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for aforceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device thatresembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around thebaby’s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently out ofthe vagina.\nForceps can be used after the cervix is fully dilated,\nand they might be required if:\n• the umbilical cord has dropped down in front of the\nbaby into the birth canal\n• the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal\nunaided\n• the baby shows signs of stress\n• the mother is too exhausted to push\nBefore placing the forceps around the baby’s head,\npain medication or anesthesia may be given to the moth-er. The doctor may use a catheter to empty the mother’sbladder, and may clean the perineal area with soapywater. Often an episiotomy is done before a forceps birth,although tears can still occur.\nThe obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time\ninto the vagina and around the side of the baby’s head togently grasp the head. When both “tongs” are in place, thedoctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby through thebirth canal as the uterus contracts. Sometimes the babycan be delivered this way after the very next contraction.\nThe frequency of forceps delivery varies from one\nhospital to the next, depending on the experience of staffand the types of anesthesia offered at the hospital. Someobstetricians accept the need for a forceps delivery as away to avoid cesarean birth. However, other obstetricalservices don’t use forceps at all.\nComplications from forceps deliveries can occur.\nSometimes they may cause nerve damage or temporary\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 758Childbirth\nStage 2: Expulsion of the fetus\nStage 2: Expulsion of the fetus. (Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 758bruises to the baby’s face. When used by an experienced\nphysician, forceps can save the life of a baby in distress.\nV acuum-assisted birth\nThis method of helping a baby out of the birth canal\nwas developed as a gentler alternative to forceps. Vacu-um-assisted birth can only be used after the cervix isfully dilated (expanded), and the head of the fetus hasbegun to descend through the pelvis. In this procedure,the doctor uses a device called a vacuum extractor, plac-ing a large rubber or plastic cup against the baby’s head.A pump creates suction that gently pulls on the cup toease the baby down the birth canal. The force of the suc-tion may cause a bruise on the baby’s head, but it fadesaway in a day or so.\nThe vacuum extractor is not as likely as forceps to\ninjure the mother, and it leaves more room for the babyto pass through the pelvis. However, there may be prob-lems in maintaining the suction during the vacuum-assisted birth, so forceps may be a better choice if it isimportant to remove the baby quickly.\nCesarean sections\nA cesarean section, also called a c-section, is a surgi-\ncal procedure in which incisions are made through awoman’s abdomen and uterus to deliver her baby.\nCesarean sections are performed whenever abnor-\nmal conditions complicate labor and vaginal delivery,threatening the life or health of the mother or the baby.The procedure is performed in the United States on near-ly one of every four babies delivered—more than900,000 babies each year. The procedure is used in caseswhere the mother has had a previous c-section and thearea of the incision has been weakened. Dystocia, or dif-ficult labor, is the another common reason for perform-ing a c-section.\nDifficult labor is commonly caused by one of the\nthree following conditions: abnormalities in the mother’sbirth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus;abnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequentcontractions.\nAnother major factor is fetal distress, a condition\nwhere the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal braindamage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis-tress is often related to abnormalities in the position ofthe fetus, or abnormalities in the birth canal, causingreduced blood flow through the placenta.\nOther conditions also can make c-section advisable,\nsuch as vaginal herpes, hypertension (high blood pres-\nsure) and diabetes in the mother.Causes and symptoms\nOne of the first signs of approaching childbirth may\nbe a “bloody show,” the appearance of a small amount ofblood-tinged mucus released from the cervix as it beginsto dilate. This is called the “mucus plug.”\nThe most common sign of the onset of labor is con-\ntractions. Sometimes women have trouble telling the dif-ference between true and false labor pains.\nTrue labor pains:\n• develop a regular pattern, with contractions coming\ncloser together\n• last from 15–30 seconds at the onset and get progres-\nsively stronger and longer (up to 60 seconds)\n• may get stronger with physical activity• occur high up on the abdomen, radiating throughout the\nabdomen and lower back\nAnother sign that labor is beginning is the breaking\nof the “bag of waters,” the amniotic sac which had cush-ioned the baby during the pregnancy. When it breaks, itreleases water in a trickle or a gush. Only about 10% ofwomen actually experience this water flow in the begin-ning of labor, however. Most of the time, the ruptureoccurs sometime later in labor. If the amniotic sac doesn’trupture on its own, the doctor will break it during labor.\nSome women have diarrhea or nausea as labor\nbegins. Others notice a sudden surge of energy and theurge to clean or arrange things right before labor begins;this is known as “nesting.”\nDiagnosis\nThe onset of labor can be determined by measuring\nhow much the cervix has dilated. The degree of dilationis estimated by feeling the opening cervix during a pelvicexam. Dilation is measured in centimeters, from zero to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 759Childbirth\nPlacenta\nbeingdetached\nUmbilicalcord\nStage 3: Expulsion of the placenta\nStage 3: Expulsion of the placenta. (Illustration by Hans &\nCassady.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 75910. Contractions that cause the cervix to dilate are the\nsign of true labor.\nFetal monitoring\nFetal monitoring is a process in which the baby’s\nheart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during laborand birth. There are several types of fetal monitoring.\nA special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be\nused. This is a simple and non-invasive method.\nThe Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves a\nhandheld listening device that transmits the sounds of theheart rate through a speaker or into an attached ear piece.It can usually pick up the heart sounds 12 weeks afterconception. This method offers intermittent monitoring.It allows the mother freedom to move about and is alsouseful during contractions.\nElectronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and\nprovides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to themother’s contractions. It can be used either continuouslyor intermittently. It is often used in high risk pregnan-cies, and is not often recommended for low risk onesKEY TERMS\nAmniotic sac —The membranous sac that sur-\nrounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid aspregnancy advances.\nBreech birth —Birth of a baby bottom-first, instead\nof the usual head first delivery. This can add tolabor and delivery problems because the baby’sbottom doesn’t mold a passage through the birthcanal as well as does the head.\nCervix —A small cylindrical organ about an inch\nor so long and less than an inch around that makesup the lower part and neck of the uterus. Thecervix separates the body and cavity of the uterusfrom the vagina.\nEmbryo —The unborn child during the first eight\nweeks of its development following conception.\nGestation —The period from conception to birth,\nduring which the developing fetus is carried in theuterus.\nPerineum —The area between the thighs that lies\nbehind the genital organs and in front of the anus.\nPlacenta —The organ that develops in the uterus\nduring pregnancy and that links the blood suppliesof mother and baby.because it renders the mother immobile and requires\ninterpretation.\nInternal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is more\naccurate than electronic monitoring and provides continu-ous monitoring for the high risk mother. This requires themother’s water to be broken and that she be two to threecentimeters dilated. It is used in high-risk situations only.\nTelemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitor-\ning. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrumenton the mother’s thigh. The mother is able to remainmobile. It provides continuous monitoring and is used inhigh-risk situations.\nTreatment\nMost women choose some type of pain relief during\nchildbirth, ranging from relaxation and imagery to drugs.The specific choice may depend on what’s available, thewoman’s preferences, her doctor’s recommendations,and how the labor is proceeding. All drugs have somerisks and some advantages.\nRegional anesthetics\nRegional anesthetics include epidurals and spinals.\nIn this technique, medication is injected into the spacearound the spinal nerves. Depending on the type of med-ications used, this type of anesthesia can block nerve sig-nals, causing temporary pain relief, or a loss of sensationfrom the waist down. An epidural or spinal block canprovide complete pain relief during cesarean birth.\nAn epidural is placed with the woman lying on her\nside or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to allowmore space between the vertebrae. Her back is scrubbedwith antiseptic, and a local anesthetic is injected in theskin to numb the site. The needle is inserted between twovertebrae and through the tough tissue in front of thespinal column. A catheter is put in place that allows con-tinuous doses of anesthetic to be given.\nThis type of anesthesia provides complete pain\nrelief, and can help conserve a woman’s energy, since shecan relax or even sleep during labor. This type of anes-thesia does require an IV and fetal monitor. It may beharder for a woman to bear down when it comes time topush, although the amount of anesthesia can be adjustedas this stage nears.\nSpinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as\nepidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of c-section delivery. It is administered in the same way as anepidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The amountof anesthetic injected is large, since it must be injected atone time. Because of the anesthetic’s effect on motornerves, most women using it cannot push during delivery.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 760ChildbirthGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 760This is a disadvantage in labor, but not an issue during a c-\nsection. Spinals provide quick and strong anesthesia andallow for major abdominal surgery with almost no pain.\nNarcotics\nShort-acting narcotics can ease pain and don’t inter-\nfere with a woman’s ability to push. However, they cancause sedation ,dizziness , nausea, and vomiting. Narcotics\ncross the placenta and may slow down a baby’s breathing;they can’t be given too close to the time of delivery.\nNatural childbirth and preparation for childbirth\nThere are several methods to prepare for childbirth.\nThe one selected often depends on what is availablethrough the healthcare provider. Overall, family involve-ment is receiving increased attention by the healthcaresystems, and many hospitals now offer birthing roomsand maternity centers to help the entire family. There areseveral choices available for childbirth preparation.\nLamaze, or Lamaze-Pavlov, is the most common in\nthe United States today. It was the first popular naturalchildbirth method, becoming popular in the 1960s.Breathing exercises and concentration on a focal pointare practiced to allow mothers to control pain whilemaintaining consciousness. This allows the flow of oxy-gen to the baby and to the muscles in the uterus to bemaintained. A partner coaches the mother throughout thebirthing process.\nThe Read method, named for Dick Read, is a tech-\nnique of breathing that was originated in the 1930s tohelp mothers deal with apprehension and tension associ-ated with childbirth. This natural childbirth method usesdifferent breathing for the different stages of childbirth.\nThe LeBoyer method stresses a relaxed delivery in a\nquiet, dim room. It attempts to avoid overstimulation ofthe baby and to foster mother-child bonding by placingthe baby on the mother’s abdomen and having the mothermassage him or her immediately after the birth. Then thefather washes the baby in a warm bath.\nThe Bradley method is called father-coached child-\nbirth, because it focuses on the father serving as coachthroughout the process. It encourages normal activitiesduring the first stages of labor.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie A. Eisenstat, and Terra Ziporyn.\nThe Harvard Guide to Women’s Health.

Theirsocial development will progress throughout childhoodand adolescence as they develop friendships, start to beinfluenced by their peers, and begin to show interest inthe opposite sex.\nFactors which can have a negative impact on the\nemotional and social well-being of children include:\n• Violence. Bullying can cause serious damage to a\nchild’s sense of self-esteem and personal safety, as canexperiences with school violence.\n• Family turmoil. Divorce, death , and other life-chang-\ning events that alter the family dynamic can have a seri-ous impact on a child. Even a positive event such as thebirth of a sibling or a move to a new city and school canput emotional strain on a child.\n•Stress . The pressure to perform well academically and\nin extracurricular activities such as sports can be over-whelming to some children.• Peer pressure. Although it can have a positive impact,\npeer pressure is often a source of significant stress forchildren. This is particularly true in adolescence when“fitting in” seems all-important.\n• Drugs and alcohol. Curiosity is intrinsic to childhood,\nand over 30% of children have experimented with alco-hol by age 13. Open communication with children thatsets forth parental expectations about drug and alcoholuse is essential.\n• Negative sexual experiences. Sexual abuse and assault\ncan emotionally scar a child and instill negative feel-ings about sexuality and relationships.\nCauses and symptoms\nChildhood health problems may be congenital (i.e.,\npresent at birth) or acquired through infection, immunesystem deficiency, or another disease process. They mayalso be caused by physical trauma (e.g., a car accident ora playground fall) or a toxic substance (e.g., an allergen,drug, or poisonous chemical), or triggered by genetic orenvironmental factors.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 763Children’s health\nDR. BENJAMIN SPOCK (1903–1998)\nBenjamin Spock, pediatrician and political activist,\nwas most noted for his authorship of Baby and Child\nCare, which significantly changed predominant attitudestoward the raising of infants and children. He began med-\nical school at Yale University in 1925, and transferred toColumbia University’s College of Physicians and Sur-geons in 1927. Spock had decided well before starting hismedical studies that he would “work with children, whohave their whole lives ahead of them” and so, upon tak-ing his M.D. degree in 1929 and serving his generalinternship at the prestigious Presbyterian Hospital, hespecialized in pediatrics at a small hospital crowded withchildren in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen area.\nOn a summer vacation in 1943 he began to write his\nmost famous book and he continued to work on it from1944 to 1946 while serving as a medical officer in theNavy. The book sharply broke with the authoritarian toneand rigorous instructions found in earlier generations ofbaby-care books, most of which said to feed infants on astrict schedule and not to pick them up when they cried.Spock, who spent ten years trying to reconcile his psycho-analytic training with what mothers were telling him abouttheir children, told his readers “Y ou know more than youthink you do. Don’t be afraid to trust your own commonsense. Take it easy, trust your own instincts, and follow thedirections that your doctor gives you.” The response wasoverwhelming. Baby and Child Care rapidly became\nAmerica’s all-time best-seller except for Shakespeare andthe Bible; by 1976 it had also eclipsed Shakespeare.\n(Library of Congress.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 763Physical and mental health problems in childhood\ncan cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. However, thefollowing behaviors frequently signify a larger emotion-al, social, or mental disturbance:\n• signs of alcohol and drug use\n• falling grades\n• lack of interest in activities that were previously enjoy-\nable to the child\n• excessive anxiety\n• persistent, prolonged depression\n• withdrawal from friends and family• violence• temper tantrums or inappropriate displays of anger\n• self-inflicted injury\n• bizarre behavior and/or speech• trouble with the police\n• sexual promiscuity\n• suicide attempts\nThe causes of developmental disorders and delays\nand learning disabilities are not always fully understood.Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and autisticspectrum disorder (more commonly known as autism)are characterized by unresponsiveness and severe impair-ments in one or more of the following areas:\n• Social interaction. Autistic children are often unaware\nof acceptable social behavior and are withdrawn andsocially isolated. They frequently do not like physicalcontact.\n• Communication and language. A child with autism or\nPDD may not speak or may display limited or imma-ture language skills.\n• Behavior. Autistic or PDD children may have difficulty\ndealing with anger, can be self-injurious, and may dis-play obsessive behavior.\nAutism is associated with brain abnormalities, but\nthe exact mechanisms that trigger the disorder are yet tobe determined. It has been linked to certain congenitalconditions such as neurofibromatosis ,fragile X syn-\ndrome , and phenylketonuria (PKU).\nDiagnosis\nPhysical, intellectual, emotional, and social matura-\ntion are all important markers of a child’s overall healthand well-being. When evaluating children, pediatriciansand child-care specialists assess related skill sets, such asa child’s acquisition and use of language, fine and grossmotor skills, cognitive growth, and socialization, andachievement of certain milestones in these areas. A\ndevelopmental milestone is a task or skill set that a childis expected to reach at a certain age or stage of life. Forexample, by age one, most children have achieved thephysical milestone of walking with the assistance of anadult. Developmental disorders may be identified and/ordiagnosed by physicians, teachers, child psychologists,therapists, counselors, and other professionals who inter-act with children on a regular basis.\nIt is important to remember that all children are\nunique, and develop at different paces within this broadframework. Reaching a milestone early or late does notnecessarily indicate a developmental problem. However,if a child is consistently lagging on achieving milestones,or has a significant deficit in one developmental area, heor she may be experiencing developmental delays.\nPediatricians and other medical professionals typi-\ncally diagnose physical illness and disease in children. Incases of illness and injury, children will undergo a thor-ough physical examination and patient history. Diag-\nnostic tests may be performed as appropriate. In cases ofmental or emotional disorders, a psychologist or othermental healthcare professional will meet with the patientto conduct an interview and take a detailed social andmedical history. Interviews with a parent or guardianmay also be part of the diagnostic process. The physicianmay also administer one or more psychological tests\n(also called clinical inventories, scales, or assessments).\nTreatment\nMedications may be prescribed to treat certain child-\nhood illnesses. Proper dosage is particularly importantwith infants and children, as medications such as aceta-\nminophen can be toxic in excessive amounts. Parents\nand caregivers should always follow the instructions foruse that accompany medications, and inform the child’spediatrician if the child is taking any other drugs or vita-\nmins to prevent potentially negative drug interactions.\nAny side effects or adverse reactions to medicationshould be reported to the child’s physician. If antibiotics\nare prescribed, the full course should always be taken.\nOther treatments for childhood illness and/or injuries\ninclude, but are not limited to, nutritional therapy, physicaltherapy, respiratory therapy, medical devices (e.g., hear-\ning aids , glasses, braces), and in some cases, surgery.\nCounseling is typically a front-line treatment for\npsychological disorders. Therapy approaches includepsychotherapy, cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy,family counseling, and group therapy .

Psychoactive medication may also be pre-\nscribed for symptom relief in children and adolescentswith mental disorders.\nSupport groups may also provide emotional support\nfor children with chronic illnesses or mental disorders.This approach, which allows individuals to seek adviceand counsel from others in similar circumstances, can beextremely effective, especially in older children wholook towards their peers for guidance and support.\nSpeech therapy may be helpful to children with\ndevelopmental delays in language acquisition. Childrenwith learning disorders can benefit from special educa-tion therapy.\nAlternative treatment\nTherapeutic approaches that encourage self-discov-\nery and empowerment may be useful in treating somechildhood emotional traumas and mental disorders. Art\ntherapy , the use of the creative process to express and\nunderstand emotion, encompasses a broad range ofhumanistic disciplines, including visual arts, dance,drama, music, film, writing, literature, and other artisticgenres. It can be particularly effective in children whomay have difficulty gaining insight to emotions andthoughts they are otherwise incapable of expressing.\nCertain mild herbal remedies may also be safely\nused with children, such as ginger ( Zingiber officinale )\ntea for nausea and aloe vera salve for burns . Parents and\ncaregivers should always consult their healthcareprovider before administering herbs to children.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for childhood health problems varies\nwidely. In general, early detection and proper treatmentcan greatly improve the odds of recovery from manychildhood ailments.\nSome learning disabilities and mild developmental\ndisorders can be overcome or greatly improved throughthe therapies discussed above. However, as of early 2001,there was no known medical treatment or pharmacologi-cal therapy that is capable of completely eliminating allof the symptoms associated with pervasive developmen-\ntal disorder (PDD), autism spectrum disorder, and mentalretardation. Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia andbipolar disorder are also chronic, lifelong disorders,although their symptoms can often be well-controlledwith medication.\nPrevention\nParents can take some precautions to ensure the\nsafety of their children. Childproofing the home, follow-ing a recommended immunization schedule, educatingkids on safety, learning CPR , and taking kids for regular\nwell-child check-ups can help to protect against physicalharm. In addition, encouraging open communicationwith children can help them grow both emotionally andsocially. Providing a loving and supportive home envi-ronment can help to nurture an emotionally healthy childwho is independent, self-confident, socially skilled,insightful, and empathetic towards others.\nBecause they are still developing motor skills, kids\ncan be particularly accident prone. Observe the followingsafety rules to protect children from injury:\n• Helmets and padding. Children should always wear a\nproperly fitted helmet and appropriate protective gearwhen riding a bike, scooter, or similar equipment orparticipating in sports. They should also ride on desig-nated bike paths whenever possible, and learn bicyclesafety rules (i.e., ride with traffic, use hand signals).\n• Playground safety. Swing sets and other outdoor play\nequipment should be well-maintained have at least 12in (30 cm) of loose fill materials (e.g., sand, woodchips) underneath to cushion falls, and children shouldalways be properly supervised at play.\n• Stay apprised of recalls. Children’s toys, play equip-\nment, and care products are frequently involved inproduct recalls. The U.S. Consumer Safety ProductsCommission (CSPC) is the agency responsible fortracking these recalls (see Resources below).\n• Stay safe in the car.

Every child who rides in a car over thisage and weight should buckle up with a properly fittedlap and shoulder belt.\n• Teach children pedestrian safety. Younger children\nshould never be allowed to cross the street by them-selves, and older kids should know to follow trafficsigns and signals, cross the street at the corner, and lookboth ways before stepping off the curb.\n• Teach children about personal safety. Kids should know\nwhat to do in case they get lost or are approached by astranger. It is also imperative that parents talk openlywith their children about their body and sexuality, andwhat behavior is inappropriate, to protect them againstsexual predators.\nChild-proofing the household is also an important\nstep towards keeping kids healthy. To make a house asafe home:\n• Ban guns. Accidental shootings in the home injure an\nestimated 1,500 children under age 14 each year. If agun must be in the home, it should be securely lockedin a tamper proof box or safe.\n• Keep all matches, lighters, and flammable materials\nproperly stored and out of the reach of children.\n• Make sure hot water heaters are set to 120 degrees or\nbelow to prevent scalding injuries.\n• Equip the home with working fire extinguishers and\nsmoke alarms, and teach children what to do in case offire.\n• Secure all medications (including vitamins, herbs, and\nsupplements), hazardous chemicals, and poisonoussubstances (including alcohol and tobacco).\n• Don’t smoke. Aside from causing cancer and other\nhealth problems in smokers, second-hand smoke is haz-ardous to a child’s health.\n• Keep small children away from poisonous plants out-\ndoors, and remove any indoor plants that are toxic.• Post the phone numbers of poison control and the pedi-\natrician near the phone, and teach children about dial-ing 9-1-1 for emergencies.\n• Children under age five should never be left alone in the\nbathtub, wading pool, or near any standing watersource (including an open toilet). Drowning is the lead-ing cause of death by injury for children between theages of one and four.\n• Remove lead paint. Lead is a serious health hazard for\nchildren, and houses built before 1978 should be testedfor lead paint. If lead is found, the paint should beremoved using the appropriate safety precautions.\nThese safety guidelines are not all-inclusive, and\nthere are many age-specific safety precautions that par-ents and guardians of children should observe. For exam-ple, infants should never be left with a propped-up bottlein their mouths or given small play items because of thechoking hazards involved.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHoltzman, Debra Smiley.

    "title": "Chiropractic",
    "content": "Chiropractic\nDefinition\nChiropractic is from Greek words meaning done by\nhand. It is grounded in the principle that the body canheal itself when the skeletal system is correctly alignedand the nervous system is functioning properly. Toachieve this, the practitioner uses his or her hands or anadjusting tool to perform specific manipulations of thevertebrae. When these bones of the spine are not correct-ly articulated, resulting in a condition known as subluxa-tion, the theory is that nerve transmission is disruptedand causes pain and illness manifested in the back as\nwell as other areas of the body.\nChiropractic is one of the most popular alternative\ntherapies currently available. Some would say it nowqualifies as mainstream treatment as opposed to comple-mentary medicine. Chiropractic treatment is covered bymany insurance plans. It has become well-accepted treat-ment for acute pain and problems of the spine, includinglower back pain and whiplash . Applications beyond that\nscope are not supported by current evidence, althoughthere are ongoing studies into the usefulness of chiroprac-tic for such problems as ear infections, dysmenorrhea ,\ninfant colic , migraine headaches, and other conditions.\nPurpose\nMost people will experience back pain at some time\nin their lives. Injuries due to overexertion and poor pos-ture are among the most common. Depending on thecause and severity of the condition, options for treatmentmay include physical therapy, rest, medications, surgery,or chiropractic care. Chiropractic treatment carries noneof the risks of surgical or pharmacologic treatment. Prac-titioners use a holistic approach to health, which isappreciated by most patients. The goal is not merely torelieve the present ailment, but to analyze the cause andrecommend appropriate changes of lifestyle to preventthe problem from recurring again. They believe in arisk/benefit analysis before use of any intervention. Theodds of an adverse outcome are extremely low. Chiro-practic has proven in several studies to be less expensivethan many more traditional routes such as outpatientphysical therapy. Relief from some neuromuscular prob-lems is immediate, although a series of treatments is like-ly to be required to maintain the improvement. Spinalmanipulation is an excellent option for acute lower backpain, and may also relieve neck pain as well as othermusculoskeletal pain. Although most back pain will sub-side eventually with no treatment at all, chiropractictreatment can significantly shorten the time it takes to getrelief. Some types of headache can also be successfully\ntreated by chiropractic.\nDescription\nOrigins\nSpinal manipulation has a long history in many cul-\ntures but Daniel D. Palmer is the founder of modern chi-ropractic theory, dating back to the 1890s. A grocer andmagnetic healer, he applied his knowledge of the nervoussystem and manual therapies in an unusual situation. Onerenowned story concerns Harvey Lillard, a janitor in theoffice where Palmer worked. The man had been deaf for17 years, ever since he had sustained an injury to hisupper spine. Palmer performed an adjustment on a painfulvertebra in the region of the injury and Lillard’s hearingwas reputedly restored. Palmer theorized that all commu-nication from the brain to the rest of the body passesthrough the spinal canal, and areas that are poorly alignedor under stress can cause physical symptoms both in the\nspine and in other areas of the body. Thus the body hasthe innate intelligence to heal itself when unencumberedby spinal irregularities causing nerve interference. Afterhis success with Lillard, other patients began coming tohim for care, and responded well to adjustments. Thisresulted in Palmer’s further study of the relationshipbetween an optimally functional spine and normal health.\nPalmer founded the first chiropractic college in\n1897. His son, B. J. Palmer, continued to develop chiro-practic philosophy and practice after his father’s death .\nB. J. and other faculty members were divided over therole of subluxation in disease. B. J. saw it as the cause ofall disease. The others disagreed and sought a more ratio-nal way of thinking, thus broadening the base of chiro-practic education. From 1910–1920, many other chiro-practic colleges were established. Other innovators,including John Howard, Carl Cleveland, Earl Home-wood, Joseph Janse, Herbert Lee, and Claude Watkins,also helped to advance the profession.\nThe theories of the Palmers receive somewhat\nbroader interpretation today. Many chiropractors believethat back pain can be relieved and health restoredthrough chiropractic treatment even in patients who donot have demonstrable subluxations. Scientific develop-ment and research of chiropractic is gaining momentum.The twenty-first century will likely see the metaphysicalconcepts such as innate intelligence give way to morescientific proofs and reform.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 767ChiropracticGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 767Many people besides the Palmers have contributed\nto the development of chiropractic theory and technique.Some have gone on to create a variety of procedures andrelated types of therapy that have their roots in chiroprac-tic, including McTimoney-Corley chiropractic, cran-iosacral manipulation, naprapathy, and applied kinesiol-\nogy. Osteopathy is another related holistic discipline\nthat utilizes spinal and musculoskeletal manipulation as apart of treatment, but osteopathic training is more similarin scope to that of an M.D.\nInitial visit\nAn initial chiropractic exam will most often include a\nhistory and a physical. The patient should be asked aboutwhat the current complaint is, whether there are chronichealth problems, family history of disease, dietary habits,medical care received, and any medications currently\nbeing taken. Further, the current complaint should bedescribed in terms of how long it has been a problem,how it has progressed, and whether it is the result of aninjury or occurred spontaneously. Details of how aninjury occurred should be given. The physical examshould evaluate by observation and palpation whether thepainful area has evidence of inflammation or poor align-ment. Range of motion may also be assessed. In the spine,either hypomobility (fixation) or hypermobility may be aproblem. Laboratory analysis is helpful in some cases torule out serious infection or other health issues that mayrequire referral for another type of treatment. Many prac-titioners also insist on x rays during the initial evaluation\nManipulation\nWhen spinal manipulation is employed, it is generally\ndone with the hands, although some practitioners may usean adjusting tool. A classic adjustment involves a highvelocity, low amplitude thrust that produces a usuallypainless popping noise, and improves the range of motionof the joint that was treated. The patient may lie on a spe-cially designed, padded table that helps the practitioner toachieve the proper positions for treatment. Some adjust-ments involve manipulating the entire spine, or large por-tions of it, as a unit; others are small movements designedto affect a single joint. Stretching, traction , and slow\nmanipulation are other techniques that can be employed torestore structural integrity and relieve nerve interference.\nLength of treatment\nThe number of chiropractic treatments required will\nvary depending on several factors. Generally longer-termtreatment is needed for conditions that are chronic,severe, or occur in conjunction with another health prob-lem. Patients who are not in overall good health may alsohave longer healing times. Some injuries will inherentlyrequire more treatments than others in order to get relief.Care is given in three stages. Initially appointments aremore frequent with the goal of relieving immediate pain.Next, the patient moves into a rehabilitative stage to con-tinue the healing process and help to prevent a relapse.Finally, the patient may elect periodic maintenance, orwellness treatments, along with lifestyle changes if need-ed in order to stay in good health.\nFollow-up care\nDischarge and follow-up therapy are important. If an\ninjury occurred as a result of poor fitness or health, a pro-gram of exercise or nutrition should be prescribed.\nHome therapy may also be recommended, involvingsuch things as anti-inflammatory medication and appli-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 768Chiropractic\nAn example of a McTimoney chiropractic technique on\npatient’s lumbar vertebra.The McTimoney chiropractic is asystem of adjustment by hand of displacements of thespinal column and bones.

Conscious attention to pos-\nture may help some patients avoid sustaining a similarinjury in the future, and the chiropractor should be ableto discern what poor postural habits require correction. Asedentary lifestyle, particularly with a lot of time spentsitting, is likely to contribute to poor posture and maypredispose a person to back pain and injury.\nTypes of practitioners\nSome practitioners use spinal manipulation to the\nexclusion of all other modalities, and are known asstraight chiropractors. Others integrate various types oftherapy such as massage, nutritional intervention, ortreatment with vitamins , herbs, or homeopathic reme-\ndies. They also embrace ideas from other health care tra-ditions. This group is known as mixers. The vast majorityof chiropractors, perhaps 85%, fall in this latter category.\nPreparations\nPatients should enter the chiropractic clinic with an\nopen mind. This will help to achieve maximum results.\nPrecautions\nChiropractic is not an appropriate therapy for dis-\neases that are severely degenerative and may requiremedication or surgery. Many conditions of the spine areamenable to manipulative treatment, but that does notinclude fractures . The practitioner should be informed\nin advance if the patient is on anticoagulants, or hasosteoporosis or any other condition that may weaken the\nbones. There are other circumstances that would con-traindicate chiropractic care, and these should be detect-ed in the history or physical exam. In addition to frac-tures, Down syndrome , some congenital defects, and\nsome types of cancer are a few of the things that may\npreclude spinal manipulation. On rare occasions, a frac-ture or dislocation may occur. There is also a very slimpossibility of experiencing a stroke as a result of spinal\nmanipulation, but estimates are that it is no more fre-quent than 2.5 occurrences per one million treatments.\nBe wary of chiropractors who insist on costly x rays\nand repeated visits with no end in sight. Extensive use isnot scientifically justifiable, especially in most cases oflower back pain. There are some circumstances when xrays are indicated, including acute or possibly severeinjuries such as those that might result from a car accident.\nSide effects\nIt is not uncommon to have local discomfort in the\nform of aches, pains, or spasms for a few days followingDANIEL PALMER (1845–1913)\nChiropractic inventor, Daniel David Palmer, was\nborn on March 7, 1845, in Toronto, Ontario. He wasone of five siblings, the children of a shoemaker and hiswife, Thomas and Katherine Palmer. Daniel Palmer andhis older brother fell victim to wanderlust and left Cana-da with a tiny cash reserve in April 1865. They immi-grated to the United States on foot, walking for 30 daysbefore arriving in Buffalo, New York. They traveled byboat through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Detroit, Michi-gan. There they survived by working odd jobs and sleep-ing on the dock. Daniel Palmer settled in What Cheer,Iowa, where he supported himself and his first wife as agrocer and fish peddler in the early 1880s. He latermoved to Davenport, Iowa, where he raised threedaughters and one son.\nPalmer was a man of high curiosity. He investigated\na variety of disciplines of medical science during hislifetime, many of which were in their infancy. He wasintrigued by phrenology and assorted spiritual cults, andfor nine years he investigated the relationship betweenmagnetism and disease. Palmer felt that there was onething that caused disease. He was intent upon discover-ing this one thing, or as he called it: the great secret.\nIn September 1895, Palmer purported to have cured\na deaf man by placing pressure on the man’s displacedvertebra. Shortly afterward Palmer claimed to cureanother patient of heart trouble, again by adjusting a dis-placed vertebra. The double coincidence led Palmer totheorize that human disease might be the result of dislo-cated or luxated bones, as Palmer called them. Thatsame year he established the Palmer School of Chiro-practic where he taught a three-month course in the sim-ple fundamentals of medicine and spinal adjustment.\nPalmer, who was married six times during his life,\ndied in California in 1913; he was destitute. His son,Bartlett Joshua Palmer, successfully commercialized thepractice of chiropractic.\na chiropractic treatment. Some patients may also experi-\nence mild headache or fatigue that resolves quickly.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAs recently as the 1970s, the American Medical\nAssociation (a national group of medical doctors) wasquite hostile to chiropractic, which it deemed a cult.AMA members were advised that it was unethical to beassociated with chiropractors. Fortunately that haschanged, and as of 2000, many allopathic or traditionallytrained physicians enjoy cordial referral relationshipswith chiropractors. The public is certainly strongly in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 769ChiropracticGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 769favor of chiropractic treatment. An estimated 15% of\npeople in the United States used chiropractic care in1997. Chiropractors see the lion’s share of all patientswho seek medical help for back problems.\nResearch has also supported the use of spinal manip-\nulation for acute low back pain. There is some anecdotalevidence recommending chiropractic treatment for ail-ments unrelated to musculoskeletal problems, but there isnot enough research-based data to support this. On theother hand, a chiropractor may be able to treat problemsand diseases unrelated to the skeletal structure byemploying therapies other than spinal manipulation.\nAlthough many chiropractors limit their practice to\nspine and joint problems, others claim to treat disordersthat are not closely related to the back or musculoskeletalsystem. These include asthma ,bed-wetting ,bronchitis ,\ncoughs, dizziness , dysmenorrhea, earache, fainting ,\nheadache, hyperactivity, indigestion ,infertility ,\nmigraine, pneumonia , and issues related to pregnancy .\nThere are at least three explanations for possible efficacyfor these conditions. One is that the problem could belinked to a nerve impingement, as may be possible withbed-wetting, dizziness, fainting, and headache. In a sec-ond group, chiropractic treatment may offer some relieffrom complicating pain and spasms caused by the dis-ease process, as with asthma, bronchitis, coughs, andpneumonia. The discomforts of pregnancy may also berelieved with gentle chiropractic therapy. A third possi-bility is that manipulation or use of soft-tissue techniquesmay directly promote improvement of some conditions.One particular procedure, known as the endonasal tech-nique, is thought to help the eustachian tube to open andthus improve drainage of the middle ear. The tube issometimes blocked off due to exudates or inflammatoryKEY TERMS\nAdjustment —A very specific type of manipulation\nof the spine designed to return it to proper struc-tural and functional form.\nAllopathic —Conventional practice of medicine\ngenerally associated with M.D. physicians.\nDysmenorrhea —Painful menstruation.\nOsteoporosis —A condition of decreased bone\ndensity, causing increased bone fragility, that ismost common in elderly women.\nSubluxation —Misalignment between vertebrae\nthat structurally and functionally impairs nervefunction.processes. This can offer significant relief from earaches.\nSome headaches also fall in this category, as skilled useof soft tissue techniques and adjustment may relieve themuscle tension that may initiate some headaches.\nDysmenorrhea, hyperactivity, indigestion, and infer-\ntility are said to be relieved as a result of improved flowof blood and nerve energy following treatment. Evidencefor this is anecdotal at best, but manipulation is unlikelyto be harmful if causes treatable by other modalities havebeen ruled out.\nFor conditions such as cancer, fractures, infectious\ndiseases, neurologic disease processes, and anything thatmay cause increased orthopedic fragility, chiropractictreatment alone is not an effective therapy, and may evenbe harmful in some cases. Those who have known circu-latory problems, especially with a history of thrombosis,should not have spinal manipulation.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCassileth, Barrie. The Alternative Medicine Handbook.

    "content": "Chlamydial pneumonia\nDefinition\nChlamydial pneumonia refers to one of several\ntypes of pneumonia that can be caused by various typesof the bacteria known as Chlamydia .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 770Chlamydial pneumoniaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 770Description\nPneumonia is an infection of the lungs. The air sacs\n(alveoli) and/or the tissues of the lungs become swollen,and the alveoli may fill with pus or fluid. This prevents thelungs from taking in sufficient oxygen, which deprives theblood and the rest of the body’s tissues of oxygen.\nThere are three major types of Chlamydia :Chlamy-\ndia psittaci ,Chlamydia pneumoniae , and Chlamydia tra-\nchomatis . Each of these has the potential to cause a type\nof pneumonia.\nCauses and symptoms\nChlamydia trachomatis is a major cause of sexually\ntransmitted diseases (called nongonococcal urethritis\nand pelvic inflammatory disease ). When a woman with\nan active chlamydial infection gives birth to a baby, thebaby may aspirate (suck into his or her lungs) some ofthe mother’s bacteria-laden secretions while passingthrough the birth canal. This can cause a form of relative-ly mild pneumonia in the newborn, occurring about twoto six weeks after delivery.\nChlamydia psittaci is a bacteria carried by many\ntypes of birds, including pigeons, canaries, parakeets, par-rots, and some gulls. Humans acquire the bacteria throughcontact with dust from bird feathers, bird droppings, orfrom the bite of a bird carrying the bacteria. People whokeep birds as pets or who work where birds are kept havethe highest risk for this type of pneumonia. This pneumo-nia, called psittacosis, causes fever ,cough , and the pro-\nduction of sputum containing pus. This type of pneumo-nia may be quite severe, and is usually more serious inolder patients. The illness can last several weeks.\nChlamydia pneumoniae usually causes a type of rel-\natively mild “walking pneumonia.” Patients experiencefever and cough. This type of pneumonia is called a“community-acquired pneumonia” because it is easilypassed from one member of the community to another.\nDiagnosis\nLaboratory tests indicating the presence of one of\nthe strains of Chlamydia are sophisticated, expensive,\nand performed in only a few laboratories across thecountry. For this reason, doctors diagnose most cases ofchlamydial pneumonia by performing a physical exami-\nnation of the patient, and noting the presence of certain\nfactors. For instance, if the mother of a baby sick withpneumonia is positive for a sexually transmitted diseasecaused by Chlamydia trachomatis , the diagnosis is obvi-\nous. History of exposure to birds in a patient sick withpneumonia suggests that Chlamydia psittaci may be theculprit. A mild pneumonia in an otherwise healthy per-\nson is likely to be a community-acquired walking pneu-monia, such as that caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae .\nTreatment\nTreatment varies depending on the specific type of\nChlamydia causing the infection. A newborn with\nChlamydia trachomatis improves rapidly with ery-\nthromycin. Chlamydia psittaci infection is treated with\ntetracycline, bed rest, oxygen supplementation, andcodeine-containing cough preparations. Chlamydia\npneumoniae infection is treated with erythromycin.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis is generally excellent for the newborn\nwith Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia. Chlamydia\npsittaci may linger, and severe cases have a death rate of\nas high as 30%. The elderly are hardest hit by this type ofpneumonia. A young, healthy person with Chlamydia\npneumoniae has an excellent prognosis. In the elderly,\nhowever, there is a 5–10% death rate from this infection.\nPrevention\nPrevention of Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia\ninvolves recognizing the symptoms of genital infection inthe mother and treating her prior to delivery of her baby.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 771Chlamydial pneumonia\nA transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of a sectioned\nChlamydia pneumoniae bacterium.

Sick birds can be treated with an antibiotic intheir feed. Because people can contract psittacosis fromeach other, a person sick with this infection should bekept in isolation , so as not to infect other people.\nChlamydia pneumoniae is difficult to prevent\nbecause it is spread by respiratory droplets from othersick people. Because people with this type of pneumoniado not always feel very sick, they often continue toattend school, go to work, and go to other public places.They then spread the bacteria in the tiny droplets that arereleased into the air during coughing. Therefore, thispneumonia is very difficult to prevent and often occurs inoutbreaks within communities.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDrew, W.

    "title": "Choking",
    "content": "Choking\nDefinition\nChoking is the inability to breathe because the tra-\nchea is blocked, constricted, or swollen shut.\nDescription\nChoking is a medical emergency. When a person is\nchoking, air cannot reach the lungs. If the airways cannotbe cleared, death follows rapidly.\nAnyone can choke, but choking is more common in\nchildren than in adults. Choking is a common cause ofaccidental death in young children who are apt to put toysor coins in their mouths, then unintentionally inhale them.About 3,000 adults die each year from choking on food.\nPeople also choke because infection causes the\nthroat tissue to swell shut. It is believed that this is whatcaused George Washington’s death. Allergic reactionscan also cause the throat to swell shut. Acute allergicreactions are called anaphylactic reactions and may befatal. Strangulation puts external pressure on the tracheacausing another form of choking.\nFinally, people can choke from obstructive sleep\napnea . This is a condition where tissues of the body\nobstruct the airways during sleep. Sleep apnea is mostcommon in obese men who sleep on their backs. Smok-\ning, heavy alcohol use, lung diseases such as emphyse-\nma, and an inherited tendency toward a narrowed airway\nand throat all increase the risk of choking during sleep.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are three reasons why people choke. These are:\n• mechanical obstruction• tissue swelling• crushing of the trachea\nRegardless of the cause, choking cuts off the air sup-\nply to the lungs. Indications that a person’s airway isblocked include:\n• the person cannot speak or cry out• the person’s face turns blue from lack of oxygen• the person desperately grabs at his or her throat\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 772ChokingGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 772• the person has a weak cough and labored breathing that\nproduces a high-pitched noise\n• the person has all of the above symptoms, then becomes\nunconscious\n• during sleep, the person has episodes of gasping, paus-\nes in breathing, and sudden awakenings.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosing choking due to mechanical obstruction\nis straightforward, since the symptoms are obvious evento an untrained person. In choking due to infection, theperson, usually a child, will have a fever and signs of ill-\nness before labored breathing begins. If choking is due toan allergic reaction to medication or insect bites, the per-son’s earlobes and face will swell, giving an external signthat internal swelling is also occurring.\nChoking due to sleep apnea is usually diagnosed on\nreports of symptoms by the person’s sleep partner. Thereare also alarm devices to detect the occurrence of sleepapnea. Eventually sleep may be interrupted so frequentlythat daytime drowsiness becomes a problem.\nTreatment\nChoking, except during sleep apnea, is a medical\nemergency. If choking is due to allergic reaction or infec-tion, people should summon emergency help or goimmediately to an emergency room. If choking is due toobstructed airways, the Heimlich maneuver (an emer-\ngency procedure in which a person is grasped frombehind in order to forcefully expel the obstruction)should be performed immediately. In severe cases a tra-\ncheotomy (an incision into the trachea through the neck\nbelow the larynx) must be performed.\nPatients who suffer airway obstruction during sleep\ncan be treated with a device similar to an oxygen maskthat creates positive airway pressure and delivers a mix-ture of oxygen and air.\nPrognosis\nMany people are treated successfully for choking\nwith no permanent effects. However, if treatment isunsuccessful, the person dies from lack of oxygen.

    "title": "Cholangitis",
    "content": "Cholangitis\nDefinition\nThe term cholangitis means inflammation of the bile\nducts. The term applies to inflammation of any portion ofthe bile ducts, which carry bile from the liver to the gall-bladder and intestine. The inflammation is produced bybacterial infection or sometimes other causes.\nDescription\nBile, which is needed for digestion, is produced in\nthe liver and then enters the common bile duct (CBD)through the hepatic ducts. Bile enters the gallbladderbetween meals, when the muscle or sphincter that con-trols flow of bile between the CBD and intestine isclosed. During this period, bile accumulates in the CBD;\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 773CholangitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 773the pressure in the CBD rises, as would a pipe closed off\nat one end. The increase in pressure eventually causes thebile to flow into the gallbladder. During meals, the gall-bladder contracts and the sphincter between the gallblad-der and intestine relaxes, permitting bile to flow into theintestine and take part in digestion.\nBile that has just been produced by the liver is sterile\n(free of bacteria). This is partly due to its antibacterialproperties; these are produced by the immunoglobulins(antibodies) secreted in bile, the bile acids which inhibitbacterial growth themselves, and mucus.\nA small number of bacteria may be present in the bile\nducts and gallbladder, getting there by moving backwardfrom the intestine, which unlike the bile ducts, containslarge numbers of bacteria. The normal flow of bile out ofthe ducts and into the intestine also helps keep too manyorganisms from multiplying. Bacteria also reach the bileducts from the lymph tissue or from the blood stream.\nWhen the passage of bile out of the ducts is blocked,\nthe few bacteria that are there rapidly reproduce. A par-tial blockage to the flow of bile can occur when a stonefrom the gallbladder blocks the duct, and also allowsbacteria to flow back into the CBD, and creates idealconditions for their growth. Tumors, on the other hand,cause a more complete blockage of bile flow, both in andout, so fewer infections occur. The reproducing organ-isms are often able to enter the bloodstream and infectmultiple organs such as the liver and heart valves.\nAnother source of inflammation of the bile ducts\noccurs in diseases of altered immunity, known as “autoim-mune diseases.” In these diseases, the body fails to recog-nize certain cells as part of its normal composition. Thebody thinks these cells are foreign and produces antibod-ies to fight them off, just as it fights against bacteria andviruses. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a typical exam-ple of an autoimmune disease involving the bile ducts.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs noted above, the two things that are needed for\ncholangitis to occur are: 1) obstruction to bile flow, and2) presence of bacteria within the bile ducts. The mostcommon cause of cholangitis is infection of the bileducts due to blockage by a gallstone. Strictures (portionsof ducts that have become narrow) also function in thesame way. Strictures may be due to congenital (birth)abnormalities of the bile ducts, form as a result of injuryto the bile duct (such as surgery, trauma), or result frominflammation that leads to scar tissue and narrowing.\nThe bacterium most commonly associated with infec-\ntion of the bile ducts is Escherichia coli (E. coli) which is a\nnormal inhabitant of the intestine. In some cases, morethan one type of bacteria is involved. Patients with AIDS\ncan develop infection of narrowed bile ducts with unusualorganisms such as Cryptosporidium and others.\nThe three symptoms present in about 70% of patients\nwith cholangitis are abdominal pain,fever , and jaundice .\nSome patients only have chills and fever with minimalabdominal symptoms. Jaundice or yellow discoloration ofthe skin and eyes occurs in about 80% of patients. Thecolor change is due to bile pigments that accumulate in theblood and eventually in the skin and eyes.\nInflammation due to the autoimmune disease prima-\nry sclerosing cholangitis leads to multiple areas of nar-rowing and eventual infection. Tumors can block the bileduct and also cause cholangitis, but as noted, infection isrelatively infrequent; in fact cholangitis occurs in onlyabout one in six patients with tumors.\nAnother type of bile duct infection occurs mainly in\nSoutheast Asia and is known as recurrent pyogeniccholangitis or Oriental cholangitis. It has also been iden-tified in Asians immigrating to North America. Mostpatients have stones in the bile ducts and/or gallbladder,and many cases are associated with the presence of para-sites within the ducts. The role of parasites in causinginfection is not clear. Many researchers believe that theyare just coincidental, and have nothing to do with thestones or infection.\nDiagnosis\nThe above symptoms alone are very suggestive of\ncholangitis; however, it is important to determine the exactcause and site of possible obstruction. This is becauseattacks are likely to recur, and different causes require dif-ferent treatments. For example, the treatment of cholangi-tis due to a stone in the CBD is different from that due tobile duct strictures. An elevated white blood count sug-\ngests infection, but may be normal in 20% of patients.Abnormal or elevated tests of liver function, such as biliru-bin and others are also frequently present. The specificbacteria is sometimes identified from blood cultures.\nX-ray techniques\nA number of x-ray techniques can make the diagno-\nsis of bile duct obstruction; these include ultrasound andcomputed tomography scans (CT scans). However,\nultrasound often cannot tell if an obstruction is due to astricture or stone, missing a stone in about half the cases.CT scans have an even poorer record of stone detection.\nAnother method of diagnosing and sometimes treat-\ning the cause of bile duct obstruction or narrowing iscalled percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography . In\nthis procedure, dye is injected into the ducts by means of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 774CholangitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 774a needle placed into the liver. It is also used to drain bile\nand relieve an obstruction.\nENDOSCOPIC TECHNIQUES. An endoscope is a thin\nflexible tube that uses a lens or mirror to look at variousparts of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic retro-\ngrade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can accu-\nrately determine the cause and site of blockage. It alsohas the advantage of being able to treat the cause ofobstruction, by removing stones and dilating (stretching)strictures. ERCP involves the injection of x-ray dye intothe bile ducts through an endoscope. Endoscopic ultra-sound is another endoscopic alternative, but is not asavailable as ERCP and is not therapeutic.\nTreatment\nThe first aim is to control the bacterial infection.\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics are usually used. If theKEY TERMS\nAntibiotic —A medication that is designed to kill or\nweaken bacteria.\nBilirubin —A pigment produced by the liver that is\nexcreted in bile which causes a yellow discol-oration of the skin and eyes when it accumulates inthose organs. Bilirubin levels can be measured byblood tests, and are most often elevated in patientswith liver disease or a blockage to bile flow.\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan) —A special-\nized x-ray procedure in which cross-sections of thearea in question can be examined in detail. In eval-uating the bile ducts, iodine-based dye is ofteninjected intravenously. The procedure is of greatestvalue in diagnosing the complications of gallstones(such as abscesses, pancreatitis) rather than docu-menting the presence of a stone.\nEndoscope —An endoscope as used in the field of\ngastroenterology is a thin flexible tube which uses alens or miniature camera to view various areas ofthe gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure isperformed to examine certain organs such as thebile ducts or pancreas, the organs are not vieweddirectly, but rather indirectly through the injectionof x-ray dye into the bile duct.\nEndoscopy —The performance of an exam using an\nendoscope is referred by the general termendoscopy. Diagnosis through biopsies or othermeans and therapeutic procedures can be donewith these instruments.Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) —This\nis a technique that uses high-pressure waves similarto sound waves that can be “focused” on a very smallarea, thereby fracturing small solid objects such asgallstones, kidney stones, etc. The small fragmentscan pass more easily and harmlessly into the intes-tine or can be dissolved with medications.\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis —A chronic disease\nin which it is believed that the immune system failsto recognize the cells that compose the bile ducts aspart of the same body, and attempts to destroythem. It is not clear what exactly causes the disease,but it is frequently associated with another inflam-matory disease of the digestive tract, ulcerative coli-tis. The inflammation of the ducts eventually pro-duces formation of scar tissue, causing multipleareas of narrowing (strictures) that block bile flowand lead to bacterial infection. Liver transplantgives the best chance for long-term survival.\nUltrasound —A non-invasive procedure based on\nchanges in sound waves of a frequency that cannotbe heard, but respond to changes in tissue composi-tion. It requires no preparation and no radiationoccurs. It has become the “gold standard” for diag-nosis of stones in the gallbladder, but is less accuratein diagnosing stones in the bile ducts. Gallstones assmall as 2 mm can be identified. The procedure cannow also be done through an endoscope, greatlyimproving investigation of the bile ducts.\ninfection does not come under control promptly, as noted\nby decrease in fever and pain, then other methods torelieve the obstruction and infection will be needed.Either way, definitive treatment of the cause of bile ductinfection is the next step, and this has undergone revolu-tionary changes in the past decade. Endoscopic, radi-ographic and other techniques have made it possible tosuccessfully remove stones and dilate strictures that pre-viously required surgical intervention, often with highmorbidity and mortality.\nRadiologic and endoscopic techniques\nJust as with diagnosis, treatment of cholangitis\ninvolves a number of similar procedures that differ main-ly in the way the bile ducts are entered. The aims of thesetechniques are immediate relief of obstruction and infec-tion as well as correction of any abnormalities that have\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 775CholangitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 775caused them. It is important to realize that even with\nendoscopy, x-ray dye is injected into the ducts and there-fore the radiologist plays a role in both types of proce-dures. When endoscopy is used, the muscle between theintestine and bile duct is widened, to allow stones topass. This is called a sphincterotomy and is often enoughto relieve any obstruction and help clear infection. Thewidening of the muscle is needed if other proceduresinvolving the bile duct are going to be performed.\nThe above techniques can be summarized as follows:\n• Insertion of a catheter or thin flexible tube to drain bile\nand relieve obstruction. When performed by insertionof a needle into the liver the technique is called percuta-neous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD); when per-formed endoscopically the catheter exits through thenose and is called a nasobiliary drain.\n• Balloons can be inserted into the ducts with either\nmethod to dilate strictures.\n• Insertion of a prosthesis which is a rigid or flexible tube\ndesigned to keep a narrowed area open; it is usuallyplaced after a stricture is dilated with a balloon.\n• Removal of stones can be accomplished most often by\nendoscopic techniques. A number of methods havebeen developed to perform this including laser and con-tact lithotripsy in which stones are fragmented by\nhigh-energy waves.\nSurgical treatment\nFortunately, with recent advances in the above meth-\nods, this is a last option. Nonetheless, about 5–10% ofpatients will need to undergo surgical exploration of thebile ducts.\nIn some instances, the bile duct is so narrowed due to\nprior inflammation or tumor, that it needs connection to adifferent area of the intestinal tract to drain. This is rathercomplicated surgery and carries a mortality rate of 2%.\nOther treatment\nExtracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was\nfirst used to break up kidney stones . The technique has\nbeen extended to the treatment of gallstones , in both the\ngallbladder and bile ducts. It is often combined withendoscopic procedures to ease the passage of fragmentedstones, or oral medications that can dissolve the frag-ments. Rarely, stones are also dissolved by instilling vari-ous chemicals such as ether directly into the bile ducts.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for those with cholangitis has markedly\nimproved in the last several years due in large part to thedevelopment of the techniques described above. For those\npatients whose episode of infection is caused by some-thing other than a simple stone, the future is not as bright,but still often responsive to treatment. Some patients withautoimmune disease will need liver transplantation .\nPrevention\nThis involves eliminating those factors that increase\nthe risk of infection of the bile ducts, mainly stones andstrictures. If it is medically possible, patients who havetheir gallbladder and suffer a bout of cholangitis shouldundergo surgical removal of the gallbladder and removalof any stones.\nFor other patients, a variety of therapies as outlined\nabove, including dissolving small stones with bile acids,are also available. A combination of several of thesemethods is needed in some patients. Patients should dis-cuss the risks and alternatives of these treatments withtheir physicians.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBilhartz, Lyman E., and Jay D.

    "title": "Cholecystectomy",
    "content": "Cholecystectomy\nDefinition\nA cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the\ngallbladder. The two basic types of this procedure areopen cholecystectomy and the laparoscopic approach. Itis estimated that the laparoscopic procedure is currentlyused for approximately 80% of cases.\nPurpose\nA cholecystectomy is performed to treat cholelithia-\nsis and cholecystitis . In cholelithiasis, gallstones of\nvarying shapes and sizes form from the solid componentsof bile. The presence of stones, often referred to as gall-bladder disease, may produce symptoms of excruciatingright upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoul-\nder. The gallbladder may become the site of acute infec-tion and inflammation, resulting in symptoms of upperright abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting . This condi-\ntion is referred to as cholecystitis. The surgical removalof the gallbladder can provide relief of these symptoms.\nPrecautions\nAlthough the laparoscopic procedure requires general\nanesthesia for about the same length of time as the openprocedure, laparoscopy generally produces less postoper-\native pain, and a shorter recovery period. The laparoscopicprocedure would not be preferred in cases where the gall-bladder is so inflamed that it could rupture, or when adhe-sions (additional fibrous bands of tissue) are present.\nDescription\nThe laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the inser-\ntion of a long narrow cylindrical tube with a camera onthe end, through an approximately 1 cm incision in theabdomen, which allows visualization of the internalorgans and projection of this image onto a video monitor.Three smaller incisions allow for insertion of other instru-ments to perform the surgical procedure. A laser may beused for the incision and cautery (burning unwanted tis-sue to stop bleeding), in which case the procedure may becalled laser laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nIn a conventional or open cholecystectomy, the gall-\nbladder is removed through a surgical incision high in theright abdomen, just beneath the ribs. A drain may be insert-ed to prevent accumulation of fluid at the surgical site.\nPreparation\nAs with any surgical procedure, the patient will be\nrequired to sign a consent form after the procedure isexplained thoroughly. Food and fluids will be prohibitedafter midnight before the procedure. Enemas may be\nordered to clean out the bowel. If nausea or vomiting arepresent, a suction tube to empty the stomach may beused, and for laparoscopic procedures, a urinary drainagecatheter will also be used to decrease the risk of acciden-tal puncture of the stomach or bladder with insertion ofthe trocar (a sharp-pointed instrument).\nAftercare\nPost-operative care for the patient who has had an open\ncholecystectomy, as with those who have had any majorsurgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respi-ration and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallowbecause of the effect of anesthesia, and the patient’s reluc-tance to breathe deeply due to the pain caused by the prox-imity of the incision to the muscles used for respiration. Thepatient is shown how to support the operative site whenbreathing deeply and coughing, and given pain medicationas necessary. Fluid intake and output is measured, and the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 777Cholecystectomy\nA surgeon performs a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on a\npatient. (Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Fluids are given intravenously for 24–48 hours,until the patient’s diet is gradually advanced as bowel activi-ty resumes. The patient is generally encouraged to walk 8hours after surgery and is discharged from the hospital with-in three to five days, with return to work approximately fourto six weeks after the procedure.\nCare received immediately after laparoscopic cholecys-\ntectomy is similar to that of any patient undergoing surgerywith general anesthesia. A unique post-operative pain maybe experienced in the right shoulder related to pressure fromcarbon dioxide used through the laparoscopic tubes. Thispain may be relieved by laying on the left side with rightknee and thigh drawn up to the chest. Walking will also helpincrease the body’s reabsorption of the gas. The patient isusually discharged the day after surgery, and allowed toshower on the second postoperative day. The patient isadvised to gradually resume normal activities over a threeday period, while avoiding heavy lifting for about 10 days.\nRisks\nPotential problems associated with open cholecys-\ntectomy include respiratory problems related to locationof the incision, wound infection, or abscess formation.\nPossible complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomyinclude accidental puncture of the bowel or bladder anduncontrolled bleeding.

    "content": "Cholecystitis\nDefinition\nCholecystitis refers to a painful inflammation of the\ngallbladder’s wall. The disorder can occur a single time(acute), or can recur multiple times (chronic).\nDescription\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ in the\nupper right hand corner of the abdomen. It is connectedby a series of ducts (tube-like channels) to the liver, pan-creas, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine). Toaid in digestion, the liver produces a substance calledbile, which is passed into the gallbladder. The gallblad-der concentrates this bile, meaning that it reabsorbs someof the fluid from the bile to make it more potent. After ameal, bile is squeezed out of the gallbladder by strongmuscular contractions, and passes through a duct into theduodenum. Due to the chemical makeup of bile, the con-tents of the duodenum are kept at an optimal pH level fordigestion. The bile also plays an important part in allow-ing fats within the small intestine to be absorbed.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn about 95% of all cases of cholecystitis, the gall-\nbladder contains gallstones . Gallstones are solid accu-\nmulations of the components of bile, particularly choles-terol, bile pigments, and calcium. These solids mayoccur when the components of bile are not in the correctproportion to each other. If the bile becomes overly con-centrated, or if too much of one component is present,stones may form. When these stones block the duct leav-ing the gallbladder, bile accumulates within the gallblad-der. The gallbladder continues to contract, but the bile\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 778CholecystitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 778cannot pass out of the gallbladder in the normal way.\nBack pressure on the gallbladder, chemical changes fromthe stagnating bile trapped within the gallbladder, andoccasionally bacterial infection, result in damage to thegallbladder wall. As the gallbladder becomes swollen,some areas of the wall do not receive adequate bloodflow, and lack of oxygen causes cells to die.\nWhen the stone blocks the flow of bile from the liver,\ncertain normal byproducts of the liver’s processing of redblood cells (called bilirubin) build up. The bilirubin isreabsorbed into the bloodstream, and over time this biliru-bin is deposited in the skin and in the whites of the eyes.Because bilirubin contains a yellowish color, it causes ayellowish cast to the skin and eyes that is called jaundice .\nGallstone formation is seen in twice as many women\nas men, particularly those between the ages of 20 and 60.Pregnant women, or those on birth control pills or estro-gen replacement therapy have a greater risk of gallstones,as do Native Americans and Mexican Americans. Peoplewho are overweight, or who lose a large amount ofweight quickly are also at greater risk for developinggallstones. Not all individuals with gallstones will go onto have cholecystitis, since many people never have anysymptoms from their gallstones and never know theyexist. However, the vast majority of people with chole-cystitis will be found to have gallstones. Rare causes ofcholecystitis include severe burns or injury, massive sys-\ntemic infection, severe illness, diabetes, obstruction by atumor of the duct leaving the gallbladder, and certainuncommon infections of the gallbladder (including bac-teria and worms).\nAlthough there are rare reports of patients with\nchronic cholecystitis who never experience any pain ,\nnearly 100% of the time cholecystitis will be diagnosedafter a patient has experienced a bout of severe pain inthe region of the gallbladder and liver. The pain may becrampy and episodic, or it may be constant. The pain isoften described as pushing through to the right upperback and shoulder. Because deep breathing increases thepain, breathing becomes shallow. Fever is often present,\nand nausea and vomiting are nearly universal. Jaundice\noccurs when the duct leaving the liver is also obstructed,although it may take a number of days for it to becomeapparent. When bacterial infection sets in, the patientmay begin to experience higher fever and shaking chills.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of cholecystitis involves a careful abdomi-\nnal examination. The enlarged, tender gallbladder may befelt through the abdominal wall. Pressure in the upperright corner of the abdomen may cause the patient to stopbreathing in, due to an increase in pain. This is calledMurphy’s sign. Physical examination may also reveal an\nincreased heart rate and an increased rate of breathing.\nBlood tests will show an increase in the white blood\ncount , as well as an increase in bilirubin. Ultrasound is\nused to look for gallstones and to measure the thicknessof the gallbladder wall (a marker of inflammation andscarring). A scan of the liver and gallbladder, with carefulattention to the system of ducts throughout (called the bil-iary tree) is also used to demonstrate obstruction of ducts.\nRare complications of cholecystitis include:\n• massive infection of the gallbladder, in which the gall-\nbladder becomes filled with pus (called empyema )\n• perforation of the gallbladder, in which the build-up of\nmaterial within the gallbladder becomes so great thatthe wall of the organ bursts, with a resulting abdominalinfection called peritonitis\n• formation of abnormal connections between the gall-\nbladder and other organs (the duodenum, large intes-tine, stomach), called fistulas\n• obstruction of the intestine by a very large gallstone\n(called gallstone ileus )\n• emphysema of the gallbladder, in which certain bacte-\nria that produce gas infect the gallbladder, resulting instretching of the gallbladder and disruption of its wallby gas\nTreatment\nInitial treatment of cholecystitis usually requires\nhospitalization. The patient is given fluids, salts, and sug-ars through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous or IV).No food or drink is given by mouth, and often a tube,called a nasogastric or NG tube, will need to be passedthrough the nose and down into the stomach to drain out\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 779Cholecystitis\nA close-up view of an inflamed gallbladder.

If infection is suspected, antibiotics\nare given.\nUltimately, treatment almost always involves removal\nof the gallbladder, a surgery called cholecystectomy .\nWhile this is not usually recommended while the patient isacutely ill, patients with complications usually do requireemergency surgery (immediately following diagnosis)because the death rate increases in these cases. Similarly,\nthose patients who have cholecystitis with no gallstoneshave about a 50% chance of death if the gallbladder is notquickly removed. Most patients, however, do best ifsurgery is performed after they have been stabilized withfluids, an NG tube, and antibiotics as necessary. Whenthis is possible, gallbladder removal is done within five tosix days of diagnosis. In patients who have other seriousmedical problems that may increase the risks of gallblad-der removal surgery, the surgeon may decide to leave thegallbladder in place. In this case, the operation mayinvolve removing obstructing gallstones and draininginfected bile (called cholecystotomy).\nBoth cholecystectomy and cholecystotomy may be\nperformed via the classical open abdominal operation(laparotomy).

The laparo-\nscopic procedure can also be used to remove the gallblad-der through one of the small incisions.

Of these patients,however, 25% will go on to have another attack of chole-cystitis within a year, and 60% will have another attackwithin six years. Each attack of cholecystitis increases apatient’s risk of developing life-threatening complica-tions, requiring risky emergency surgery. Therefore, earlyremoval of the gallbladder, rather than a “wait-and-see”approach, is usually recommended.

    "title": "Cholera",
    "content": "Cholera\nDefinition\nCholera is an acute illness characterized by watery\ndiarrhea that is caused by the bacterium Vibrio\ncholerae . Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking\nwater contaminated with the bacteria. Although cholerawas a public health problem in the United States andEurope a hundred years ago, modern sanitation and thetreatment of drinking water have virtually eliminated thedisease in developed countries. In third world countries,however, cholera is still common.\nDescription\nCholera is spread by eating food or drinking water\nthat has been contaminated with cholera bacteria. Conta-mination usually occurs when human feces from a per-son who has the disease seeps into a community watersupply. Fruits and vegetables can also be contaminated inareas where crops are fertilized with human feces.Cholera bacteria also live in warm, brackish water andcan infect persons who eat raw or undercooked seafoodobtained from such waters. Cholera is rarely transmitteddirectly from one person to another.\nCholera often occurs in outbreaks or epidemics. The\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) estimates that duringany cholera epidemic, approximately 0.2–1% of the localpopulation will contract the disease. Anyone can getcholera, but infants, children, and the elderly are morelikely to die from the disease because they become dehy-drated faster than adults. There is no particular season inwhich cholera is more likely to occur.\nBecause of an extensive system of sewage and water\ntreatment in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan,and Australia, cholera is generally not a concern for visi-tors and residents of these countries. People visiting orliving in other parts of the world, particularly on the Indi-an subcontinent and in parts of Africa and South Ameri-ca, should be aware of the potential for contractingcholera and practice prevention. Fortunately, the diseaseis both preventable and treatable.\nCauses and symptoms\nBecause V . cholerae bacteria are sensitive to acid,\nmost cholera-causing bacteria die in the acidic environ-ment of the stomach. However, when a person has ingest-ed food or water containing large amounts of cholera bac-teria, some will survive to infect the intestines. As wouldbe expected, antacid usage or the use of any medicationthat blocks acid production in the stomach would allowmore bacteria to survive and cause infection.\nIn the small intestine, the rapidly multiplying bacte-\nria produce a toxin that causes a large volume of waterand electrolytes to be secreted into the bowels and thento be abruptly eliminated as watery diarrhea. V omitingmay also occur. Symptoms begin to appear between oneand three days after the contaminated food or water hasbeen ingested.\nMost cases of cholera are mild, but about one in 20\npatients experience severe, potentially life-threateningsymptoms. In severe cases, fluids can be lost throughdiarrhea and vomiting at the rate of one quart per hour.This can produce a dangerous state of dehydration\nunless the lost fluids and electrolytes are rapidly replaced.\nSigns of dehydration include intense thirst, little or no\nurine output, dry skin and mouth, an absence of tears,glassy or sunken eyes, muscle cramps, weakness, andrapid heart rate. The soft spot on an infant’s head willappear to be sunken or drawn in. Dehydration occurs mostrapidly in the very young and the very old because theyhave fewer fluid reserves. A doctor should be consultedimmediately any time signs of severe dehydration occur.Immediate replacement of the lost fluids and electrolytesis necessary to prevent kidney failure, coma , and death .\nDiagnosis\nRapid diagnosis of cholera can be made by examin-\ning a fresh stool sample under the microscope for the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 781Cholera\nA false color transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of\nVibrio cholerae bacterium magnified 6,000 times its original\nsize.

Cholera can also be\ndiagnosed by culturing a stool sample in the laboratory toisolate the cholera-causing bacteria. In addition, a bloodtest may reveal the presence of antibodies against thecholera bacteria. In areas where cholera occurs often,however, patients are usually treated for diarrhea andvomiting symptoms as if they had cholera without labo-ratory confirmation.\nTreatment\nThe key to treating cholera lies in preventing dehy-\ndration by replacing the fluids and electrolytes lostthrough diarrhea and vomiting. The discovery that rehy-dration can be accomplished orally revolutionized thetreatment of cholera and other, similar diseases by mak-ing this simple, cost-effective treatment widely availablethroughout the world. The World Health Organizationhas developed an inexpensive oral replacement fluid con-taining appropriate amounts of water, sugar, and saltsthat is used worldwide. In cases of severe dehydration,replacement fluids must be given intravenously. Patientsshould be encouraged to drink when they can keep liq-uids down and eat when their appetite returns. Recoverygenerally takes three to six days.\nAdults may be given the antibiotic tetracycline to\nshorten the duration of the illness and reduce fluid loss.The World Health Organization recommends this antibi-otic treatment only in cases of severe dehydration. Ifantibiotics are overused, the cholera bacteria organism\nmay become resistant to the drug, making the antibioticineffective in treating even severe cases of cholera.

Patients\nwith milder cases of cholera usually recover on their ownin three to six days without additional complications.They may eliminate the bacteria in their feces for up totwo weeks. Chronic carriers of the disease are rare. Withprompt fluid and electrolyte replacement, the death rate inpatients with severe cholera is less than 1%. Untreated,the death rate can be greater than 50%. The difficulty intreating severe cholera is not in knowing how to treat it,but in getting medical care to ill people in underdevelopedareas of the world where medical resources are limited.\nPrevention\nThe best form of cholera prevention is to establish\ngood sanitation and waste treatment systems. In theabsence of adequate sewage treatment, the followingguidelines should be followed to reduce the possibility ofinfection:\n• Boil it. Drink and brush teeth only with water that has\nbeen boiled or treated with chlorine or iodine tablets. Safedrinks include coffee and tea made with boiling water orcarbonated bottled water and carbonated soft drinks.\n• Cook it. Eat only thoroughly cooked foods, and eat\nthem while they are still hot. Avoid eating food fromstreet vendors.\n• Peel it. Eat only fruit or nuts with a thick, intact skin or\nshell that is removed immediately before eating.\n• Forget it. Do not eat raw foods such as oysters or\nceviche. Avoid salads and raw vegetables. Do not useuntreated ice cubes in otherwise safe drinks.\n• Stay out of it. Do not swim or fish in polluted water.\nA cholera vaccine exists that can be given to travel-\ners and residents of areas where cholera is known to beactive, but the vaccine is not highly effective. It providesonly 25–50% immunity, and then only for a period ofabout six months. The vaccine is never given to infantsunder six months of age. The United States Centers forDisease Control and Prevention do not currently recom-mend cholera vaccination for travelers. Residents of\ncholera-plagued areas should discuss the value of thevaccine with their doctor.\nResources\nBOOKS\nUSP DI-Volume II, Advice for the Patient: Drug Information in\nLay Language. 17th ed. 1997.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 782CholeraGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 782ORGANIZATIONS\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. 1600 Clifton Rd.,\nNE, Atlanta, GA 30333.

    "title": "Cholestasis",
    "content": "Cholestasis\nDefinition\nCholestasis is a condition caused by rapidly devel-\noping (acute) or long-term (chronic) interruption in theexcretion of bile (a digestive fluid that helps the bodyprocess fat). The term is taken from the Greek chole ,\nbile, and stasis , standing still.\nDescription\nCholestasis is caused by obstruction within the liver\n(intrahepatic) or outside the liver (extrahepatic). Theobstruction causes bile salts, the bile pigment bilirubin,and fats (lipids) to accumulate in the blood streaminstead of being eliminated normally.\nIntrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by wide-\nspread blockage of small ducts or by disorders, such ashepatitis, that impair the body’s ability to eliminate bile.Extrahepatic cholestasis can occur as a side effect ofmany medications. It can also occur as a complication ofsurgery, serious injury, tissue-destroying infection, orintravenous feeding. Extrahepatic cholestasis can becaused by conditions such as tumors and gallstones that\nblock the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the firstpart of the small intestine (duodenum).\nPregnancy increases the sensitivity of the bile ducts\nto estrogen, and cholestasis often develops during the sec-ond and third trimesters of pregnancy. This condition isthe second most common cause of jaundice during preg-\nnancy, but generalized itching (pruritus gravidarum) is\nthe only symptom most women experience. Cholestasisof pregnancy tends to run in families. Symptoms usuallydisappear within two to four weeks after the baby’s birthbut may reappear if the woman becomes pregnant again.\nA similar condition affects some women who take\nbirth-control pills. Symptoms disappear after the womanstops using oral contraceptives . This condition does not\nlead to chronic liver disease. A woman who developscholestasis from either of these causes (pregnancy orbirth control hormones) has an increased risk of develop-ing cholestasis from the other.\nBenign familial recurrent cholestasis is a rare condi-\ntion characterized by brief, repeated episodes of itchingand jaundice. Symptoms often disappear. This conditiondoes not cause cirrhosis .\nDrug-induced cholestasis may be a complication of\nchemotherapy or other medications. The two major types\nof drug-induced cholestasis are direct toxic injury andreactions unique to an individual (idiosyncratic reactions).In direct toxic injury, the severity of symptoms parallelsthe amount of medication involved. This condition:\n• develops a short time after treatment begins• follows a predictable pattern\n• usually causes liver damage\nDirect toxic reactions develop in 1% of all patients\nwho take chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a tranquilizer andantinausea drug. Idiosyncratic reactions may occur at theonset of treatment or at a later time. Allergic responsesare varied and are not related to the amount of medica-tion being taken.\nCauses and symptoms\nIntrahepatic cholestasis is usually caused by hepati-\ntis or by medications that can produce symptoms resem-bling hepatitis. Phenothiazine-derivative drugs, includingchlorpromazine, can cause sudden fever and inflamma-\ntion. Symptoms usually disappear after use of the drug(s)is stopped. In rare cases, a condition resembling chronicbiliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized bydestruction of small bile ducts) persists even after themedication is stopped. Some patients experience a simi-lar reaction in response to tricyclic antidepressants(amitriptyline, imipramine), phenylbutazone (Butazo-lidin), erythromycin estolate (Estomycin, Purmycin), andother drugs. Intrahepatic cholestasis may also be causedby alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis ,\ncancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part\nof the body, and a number of rare disorders.\nExtrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a stone\nobstructing the passage through which bile travels from thegallbladder to the small intestine (common bile duct) or bypancreatic cancer. Less often, the condition occurs as a resultof non-cancerous narrowing of the common duct (strictures),ductal carcinoma, or disorders of the pancreas.\nCholestasis caused by the use of steroids causes lit-\ntle, if any, inflammation. Symptoms develop gradually\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 783CholestasisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 783and usually disappear after the drug is discontinued.\nOther drugs that can cause cholestasis include:\n• allopurinol (Zyloprim)\n• amitriptyline (Elavil)\n• azathioprine (Imuran)\n• benoxaprofen (Oraflex)\n• capotril (Capoten)\n• carbamazepine (Tegretol)\n• cimetidine (Tagamet)\n• hydralazine hydrochloride (Apresoline Hydrochloride)\n• imipramine (Tofranil)• penicillin\n• quinidine sulfate (Quinidex)\n• ranitidine (Zantac)\n• sulfonamides (Apo-Sulfatrim, sulfamethoxazole)\n• sulindac (Clinoril, Saldac)KEY TERMS\nBile—A bitter yellow-green substance produced by\nthe liver. Bile breaks down fats in the small intestineso that they can be used by the body.

Thetests include alkaline phosphatase and serum alanineaminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) —An imaging\ntechnique that uses a large circular magnet andradio waves to generate signals from atoms in thebody. These signals are used to construct images ofinternal structures.\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography —An x-\nray examination of the bile ducts. A needle ispassed through the skin (percutaneous) across orover the liver (transhepatic) and directly into a bileduct to inject a contrast dye. The dye enhances thex-ray image mapping the system of bile ducts(cholangiography).\nPhenothiazine-derivative drugs —A large family of\ndrugs derived from phenothiazine, a compoundthat in itself is too poisonous for human consump-tion. Phenothiazine derivatives include tranquiliz-ers, medications that prevent vomiting, antihista-mines, and drugs used to enhance the effectivenessof anesthesia.\nUltrasonography —A test using sound waves to\nmeasure blood flow. Gel is applied to a hand-heldtransducer that is pressed against the patient’s body.Images are displayed on a monitor.\nSymptoms of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic\ncholestasis include a yellow discoloration of the skin(jaundice), dark urine, and pale stools. Itching over theskin may be severe if the condition is advanced.\nSymptoms of chronic cholestasis include:\n• skin discoloration\n• scars or skin injuries caused by scratching• bone pain\n• yellowish fat deposits beneath the surface of the skin\n(xanthoma) or around the eyes (xanthelasma)\nPatients with advanced cholestasis feel ill, tire easi-\nly, and are often nauseated.

Pain or rigidity in the gallblad-der or pancreas suggest an extrahepatic form.\nBlood tests and liver function tests can reveal the\npattern and extent of liver injury, indicate functionalabnormalities, and establish the cause of the condition.However, most misdiagnoses occur when physicians relymore on laboratory analysis than on detailed medical his-tory and the results of a thorough physical examination .\nSpecial attention should be paid to three liver functiontests. Levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanineaminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) can indicate whether the patient’s condition iscaused by an obstructive condition like cholestasis or adisease of the liver cells (hepatocellular disease) likeviral hepatitis or cancer. ALP levels more than threetimes greater than normal indicate cholestasis. High lev-els of AST and particularly of ALT, which is found pre-dominantly in liver cells, indicate hepatocellular disease.\nOnce the disease pattern has been established, ultra-\nsound may be performed to determine whether obstruc-tion of the large duct has caused widening of small ductslocated close to it. Computed tomography scans (CT)\nand magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide\nmore detailed information about the source of theobstruction. If these procedures that do not enter thepatient’s body (non-invasive procedures) do not providethe information a family physician, internist, or gastroen-terologist needs to make a diagnosis of cholestasis, oneof these procedures may be performed:\n• direct cholangiography, an x-ray map of the bile ducts,\nenhanced by the use of contrast dye\n• percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, used to\nidentify obstructions that impede the flow of bile fromthe liver to the digestive system, takes x-ray images ofthe bile ducts after a contrast dye has been injected by aneedle passed directly into a hepatic duct\n• endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n(ERCP), which uses a special dye to outline the pancre-atic and common bile ducts and highlight the positionof any obstruction; a special tube with a light transmit-ter is inserted into the duct and a series of x-ray imagesis taken\nA doctor who thinks a physical obstruction is\nresponsible for progressive deterioration of a patient’scondition may consider an exploratory surgical proce-dure (diagnostic laparotomy). Liver biopsy is sometimes\nperformed if imaging tests do not indicate why a duct isenlarged, but results of a single biopsy may not representthe status of the entire organ.Treatment\nThe goal of treatment is to eliminate or control the\npatient’s symptoms. Discontinuing the use of certaindrugs can restore normal liver function, but surgery maybe needed to drain or remove obstructions or to widenaffected ducts.\nRifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), an antibacterial\ndrug; phenobarbital, a barbiturate anticonvulsant; andother drugs are sometimes prescribed to cleanse the sys-tem and eliminate bile salts and other toxic compounds.\nPatients who have chronic cholestasis and have trou-\nble digesting fat may have to restrict the amount of fat intheir diet and take calcium and water-soluble vitaminsupplements. A liver transplant may become necessary ifcomplications occur.\nPrognosis\nSymptoms almost always disappear after the under-\nlying condition is controlled.\nSome patients who have cholestasis experience symp-\ntoms only after infection develops, but chronic bile-ductobstruction always leads to cirrhosis. It may also causeosteoporosis (fragile bones) or osteomalacia (soft bones).\nEmergency care is not required unless inflammation\nof the bile ducts ( cholangitis ) develops.

Itis manufactured in the liver and carried throughout thebody in the bloodstream. Problems can occur when toomuch cholesterol forms an accumulation of plaque onblood vessel walls, which impedes blood flow to theheart and other organs. The highest cholesterol content isfound in meat, poultry, shellfish, and dairy products.\nDescription\nCholesterol is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of medi-\ncine, since it has both a good side and bad side. It is nec-essary to digest fats from food, make hormones, build cellwalls, and participate in other processes for maintaining ahealthy body. When people talk about cholesterol as amedical problem, they are usually referring to high cho-lesterol. This can be somewhat misleading, since there arefour components to cholesterol. These are:\n• LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol\n• HDL, the so-called good cholesterol\n• triglycerides, a blood fat lipid that increases the risk for\nheart disease\n• total cholesterol\nHigh LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a major con-\ntributing factor of heart disease. The cholesterol formsplaque in the heart’s blood vessels, which restricts orblocks the supply of blood to the heart, and causes acondition called atherosclerosis . This can lead to a\n“heart attack,” resulting in damage to the heart and pos-sibly death . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) estimates that 90 million American adults,roughly half the adult population, have elevated choles-terol levels.\nThe population as a whole is at some risk of devel-\noping high LDL cholesterol in their lifetimes. Specificrisk factors include a family history of high choles-terol, obesity ,heart attack or stroke ,alcoholism , and\nlack of regular exercise . The chances of developing\nhigh cholesterol increase after the age of 45. One of theprimary causes of high LDL cholesterol is too much fator sugar in the diet, a problem especially true in theUnited States. Cholesterol is also produced naturally inthe liver and overproduction may occur even in peoplewho limit their intake of high cholesterol food. LowHDL and high triglyceride levels are also risk factorsfor atherosclerosis.Causes and symptoms\nThere are no readily apparent symptoms that indi-\ncate high LDL or triglycerides, or low HDL. The onlyway to diagnose the problems is through a simple bloodtest. However, one general indication of high cholesterolis obesity. Another is a high-fat diet.\nDiagnosis\nHigh cholesterol is often diagnosed and treated by\ngeneral practitioners or family practice physicians. Insome cases, the condition is treated by an endocrinolo-gist or cardiologist. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, andtriglyceride levels as well as the cholesterol to HDL ratioare measured by a blood test called a lipid panel. Thecost of a lipid panel is generally $40–100 and is coveredby most health insurance and HMO plans, includingMedicare, providing there is an appropriate reason forthe test. Home cholesterol testing kits are available overthe counter but test only for total cholesterol. The resultsshould only be used as a guide and if the total cholesterollevel is high or low, a lipid panel should be performed bya physician. In most adults the recommended levels,measured by milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood,are: total cholesterol, less than 200; LDL, less than 130;HDL, more than 35; triglycerides, 30–200; and choles-terol to HDL ratio, four to one. However, the recom-mended cholesterol levels may vary, depending on otherrisk factors such as hypertension , a family history of\nheart disease, diabetes, age, alcoholism, and smoking .\nDoctors have always been puzzled by why some\npeople develop heart disease while others with identical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 786Cholesterol, highTypes Of Cholesterol\nTypes Levels\nTotal cholesterol:\nDesirable <200\nBorderline 200 to 240Undesirable >240\nHDL cholesterol:\nDesirable >45\nBorderline 35 to 45Undesirable <35\nLDL cholesterol:\nDesirable <130\nBorderline 130 to 160Undesirable >160\nRatio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol:\nDesirable <3\nBorderline 3 to 4Undesirable >4GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 786HDL and LDL levels do not. New studies indicate it may\nbe due to the size of the cholesterol particles in thebloodstream. A test called a nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) LipoProfile exposes a blood sample to a magnet-ic field to determine the size of the cholesterol particles.Particle size can also be determined by a centrifugationtest, where blood samples are spun very quickly to allowparticles to separate and move at different distances. Thesmaller the particles, the greater the chance of develop-ing heart disease. It allows physicians to treat patientswho have normal or close to normal results from a lipidpanel but abnormal particle size.\nTreatment\nA wide variety of prescription medicines are avail-\nable to treat cholesterol problems. These include statinssuch as Mevacor (lovastatin), Lescol (fluvastatin), Prava-chol (pravastatin), Zocor (simvastatin), Baycol (cervas-tatin), and Lipitor (atorvastatin) to lower LDL. A groupof drugs called fibric acid derivatives are used to lowertriglycerides and raise HDL. These include Lopid (gem-fibrozil), Atromid-S (clofibrate), and Tricor (fenofibrate).Doctors decide which drug to use based on the severityof the cholesterol problem, side effects, and cost.\nAlternative treatment\nThe primary goal of cholesterol treatment is to lower\nLDL to under 160 mg/dL in people without heart diseaseand who are at lower risk of developing it. The goal inpeople with higher risk factors for heart disease is less than130 mg/dL. In patients who already have heart disease, thegoal is under 100 mg/dL, according to FDA guidelines.Also, since low HDL levels increase the risks of heart dis-ease, the goal of all patients is more than 35 mg/dL.\nIn both alternative and conventional treatment of\nhigh cholesterol, the first-line treatment options are exer-cise, diet, weight loss, and stopping smoking. Otheralternative treatments include high doses of niacin, soyprotein, garlic, algae, and the Chinese medicine supple-ment Cholestin (a red yeast fermented with rice).\nDiet and exercise\nSince a large number of people with high cholesterol\nare overweight, a healthy diet and regular exercise areprobably the most beneficial natural ways to control cho-lesterol levels. In general, the goal is to substantiallyreduce or eliminate foods high in animal fat. Theseinclude meat, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. Severalspecific diet options are beneficial. One is the vegetariandiet. Vegetarians typically get up to 100% more fiber andup to 50% less cholesterol from food than non-vegetari-KEY TERMS\nAtherosclerosis —A build-up of fatty substances in\nthe inner layers of the arteries.\nEstrogen —A hormone that stimulates develop-\nment of female secondary sex characteristics.\nGlycemic —The presence of glucose in the blood.\nHypertension —Abnormally high blood pressure\nin the arteries.\nLegumes —A family of plants that bear edible\nseeds in pods, including beans and peas.\nLipid —Any of a variety of substances that, along\nwith proteins and carbohydrates, make up themain structural components of living cells.\nPolyunsaturated fats —A non-animal oil or fatty\nacid rich in unsaturated chemical bonds not associ-ated with the formation of cholesterol in the blood.\nans. The vegetarian low-cholesterol diet consists of at\nleast six servings of whole grain foods, three or moreservings of green leafy vegetables, two to four servingsof fruit, two to four servings of legumes, and one or twoservings of non-fat dairy products daily.\nA second diet is the Asian diet, with brown rice\nbeing the staple. Other allowable foods include fish, veg-etables such as bok choy, bean sprouts, and black beans.It allows for one weekly serving of meat and very fewdairy products. The food is flavored with traditionalAsian spices and condiments, such as ginger, chilies,turmeric, and soy sauce.\nAnother regimen is the low glycemic or diabetic\ndiet, which can raise the HDL (good cholesterol) level byas much as 20% in three weeks. Low glycemic foodspromote a slow but steady rise in blood sugar levels fol-lowing a meal, which increases the level of HDL. Theyalso lower total cholesterol and triglycerides. Lowglycemic foods include certain fruits, vegetables, beans,and whole grains. Processed and refined foods and sug-ars should be avoided.\nExercise is an extremely important part of lowering\nbad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. It shouldconsist of 20–30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise atleast three times a week. Exercises that cause the heart tobeat faster include fast walking, bicycling, jogging, rollerskating, swimming, and walking up stairs. There are alsoa wide selection of aerobic programs available at gymsor on videocassette.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 787Cholesterol, highGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 787Garlic\nA number of clinical studies have indicated that garlic\ncan offer modest reductions in cholesterol. A 1997 study bynutrition researchers at Pennsylvania State University\nfound men who took garlic capsules for five monthsreduced their total cholesterol by 7% and LDL by 12%.Another study showed that seven cloves of fresh garlic a daysignificantly reduced LDL, as did a daily dose of four garlicextract pills. Other studies in 1997 and 1998 back up theseresults. However, two more recent studies have questionedthe effectiveness of garlic in lowering “bad cholesterol.”\nCholestin\nCholestin hit the over-the-counter market in 1997 as\na cholesterol-lowering dietary supplement. It is aprocessed form of red yeast fermented with rice, a tradi-tional herbal remedy used for centuries by the Chinese.Two studies released in 1998 showed Cholestin loweredLDL cholesterol by 20–30%. It also appeared to raiseHDL and lower triglyceride levels. Although the supple-ment contains hundreds of compounds, the major activeLDL-lowering ingredient is lovastatin, a chemical alsofound in the prescription drug Mevacor. The FDA bannedCholestin in early 1998 but a federal district court judgelifted the ban a year later, ruling the product was a dietarysupplement, not a drug. It is not fully understood how thesubstance works and patients may want to consult withtheir physician before taking Cholestin. No serious sideeffects have been reported, but minor side effects, includ-ing bloating and heartburn , have been reported.\nOther treatments\nA study released in 1999 indicated that blue-green\nalgae contains polyunsaturated fatty acids that lowercholesterol. The algae, known as alga Aphanizomenon\nflos-aquae (AFA) is available as an over-the-counter\ndietary supplement. Niacin, also known as nicotinic acidor vitamin B\n3, has been shown to reduce LDL levels by\n10–20%, and raise HDL levels by 15–35%. It also canreduce triglycerides. But because an extremely high doseof niacin (2–3 g) is needed to treat cholesterol problems,it should only be taken under a doctor’s supervision tomonitor possible toxic side effects. Niacin can also causeflushing when taken in high doses. Soy protein with highlevels of isoflavones also have been shown to reduce badcholesterol by up to 10%. A daily diet that contains 62mg of isoflavones in soy protein is recommended, andcan be incorporated into other diet regimens, includingvegetarian, Asian, and low glycemic.\nPrognosis\nHigh cholesterol is one of the key risk factors for\nheart disease. Left untreated, too much bad cholesterolcan clog the blood vessels, leading to chest pain\n(angina ), blood clots, and heart attacks. Heart disease is\nthe number one killer of men and women in the UnitedStates. By reducing LDL, people with heart disease mayprevent further heart attacks and strokes, prolong andimprove the quality of their lives, and slow or reversecholesterol build-up in the arteries. In people withoutheart disease, lowering LDL can decrease the risk of afirst heart attack or stroke.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent cholesterol problems is\nthrough a combination of healthy lifestyle activities, aprimarily low-fat and high-fiber diet, regular aerobicexercise, not smoking, and maintaining an optimalweight. But for people with high risk factors for heartdisease, such as a family history of heart disease, dia-betes, and being over the age of 45, these measuresmay not be enough to prevent the onset of high choles-terol. There are studies being done on the effective-ness of some existing anti-cholesterol drugs for con-trolling cholesterol levels in patients who do not meetthe criteria for high cholesterol but no definitiveresults are available.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBratman, Steven, and David Kroll.

On the good side, cholesterol plays impor-tant roles in the structure of cells and in the production ofhormones. But too much cholesterol in the blood can leadto heart and blood vessel disease. To complicate matters,not all cholesterol contributes to heart and blood vesselproblems. One type, called high-density lipoprotein(HDL) cholesterol, or “good cholesterol,” actually lowersthe risk of these problems. The other type, low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or “bad cholesterol,” is thetype that threatens people’s health. The names reflect theway cholesterol moves through the body. To travelthrough the bloodstream, cholesterol must attach itself toa protein. The combination of a protein and a fatty sub-stance like cholesterol is called a lipoprotein.\nMany factors may contribute to the fact that some\npeople have higher cholesterol levels than others. A diethigh in certain types of fats is one factor. Medical prob-lems such as poorly controlled diabetes, an underactivethyroid gland, an overactive pituitary gland, liver diseaseor kidney failure also may cause high cholesterol levels.\nAnd some people have inherited disorders that preventtheir bodies from properly using and eliminating fats.This allows cholesterol to build up in the blood.\nTreatment for high cholesterol levels usually begins\nwith changes in daily habits. By losing weight, stoppingsmoking , exercising more and reducing the amount of\nfat and cholesterol in the diet, many people can bringtheir cholesterol levels down to acceptable levels. How-ever, some may need to use cholesterol-reducing drugs toreduce their risk of health problems.\nDescription\nThere are four different classes of cholesterol lower-\ning drugs:\nBile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding\nwith the bile produced by the liver. Bile helps the diges-tion and absorption of fats in the intestine. By blockingthe digestion of fats, bile acid sequesterants prevent theformation of cholesterol. Drugs in this class include:cholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); andcolesevalam (Welchol).HMG-CoA inhibitors, often called “statins,” are\ndrugs that block an enzyme called “3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.” This blocks one of thesteps in converting fat to cholesterol. These are the mosteffective cholesterol lowering agents available. Drugs inthis group include: atorvastatin (Lipitor); cerivastatin(Baycol); fluvastatin (Lescol); lovastatin (Mevacor);pravastatin (Pravachol); and simvastatin (Zocor).\nFibric acid derivatives include clofibrate (Atromid-\nS); gemfibrozil (Lopid); and fenofibrate (Tricor).Although these drugs are less effective than the statins atlowering total cholesterol, they may be able to lower thelow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raisingthe high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theirexact mechanism of action is believed to be associatedwith inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity.\nNiacin, vitamin B-3, is also effective in lowering\ncholesterol levels. Although the normal vitamin dose ofniacin is only 20 mg, the dose required to reduce choles-terol levels is at least 500 mg each day. The mechanismof action of niacin in cholesterol reduction is associatedwith the inhibition of VLDL secretion in the blood-stream.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\ncholesterol-reducing drug used. The prescribing physi-cian or the pharmacist who filled the prescription canadvise about the correct dosage.\nCholesterol-reducing drugs should be taken exactly\nas directed and doses should not be missed. Doubledoses should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.\nPhysicians may prescribe a combination of choles-\nterol-reducing drugs, such as pravastatin and colestipol.Following the directions for how and when to take thedrugs is very important. The medicine may not workproperly if both drugs are taken at the same time of day.\nNiacin should not be taken at the same time as an\nHMG-CoA inhibitor, as this combination may causesevere muscle problems. If niacin is taken in an over-the-counter form, both the prescribing physician and phar-macist should be informed. There are no problems whenthe niacin is taken in normal doses as a vitamin.\nThe prescription should not be stopped without first\nchecking with the physician who prescribed it. Choles-terol levels may increase when the medicine is stopped,and the physician may prescribe a special diet to makethis less likely.\nPrecautions\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking cholesterol-\nreducing drugs is important. The physician will check to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 789Cholesterol-reducing drugsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 789make sure the medicine is working as it should and will\ndecide whether it is still needed. Blood tests and othermedical tests may be ordered to help the physician moni-tor the drug’s effectiveness and check for side effects.\nFor most people, cholesterol-reducing drugs are just\none part of a whole program for lowering cholesterol lev-els. Other important elements of the program mayinclude weight loss, exercise , special diets and changes\nin other habits. The medication should never be viewedas a substitute for other measures ordered by the physi-cian. Cholesterol-reducing drugs will not cure problemsthat cause high cholesterol; they will only help controlcholesterol levels.\nPeople over 60 years of age may be unusually sensi-\ntive to the effects of some cholesterol-reducing drugs.This may increase the chance of side effects.\nAnyone who is taking an HMG-CoA reductase\ninhibitor should notify the health care professional incharge before having any surgical or dental procedures orreceiving emergency treatment.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or who\nare taking certain other medications may have problemsif they take cholesterol-reducing drugs. Before takingthese drugs, the prescribing physician should beinformed of any of the following conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\nto cholesterol-reducing drugs in the past should informthe prescribing physician before taking the drugs again.The physician should also be told about any allergies to\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\nPREGNANCY. Studies of laboratory animals have\nshown that giving high doses of gemfibrozil duringpregnancy increases the risk of birth defects and other\nproblems, including death of the unborn baby. The\neffects of this drug have not been studied in pregnantwomen. Women who are pregnant or who may becomepregnant should check with their physicians beforeusing gemfibrozil.\nCholesterol-reducing drugs in the group known as\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin, flu-vastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin) should not be takenby women who are pregnant or who plan to becomepregnant soon. By blocking the production of choles-terol, these drugs prevent a fetus from developing proper-ly. Women who are able to bear children should use aneffective birth control method while taking these drugs.Any woman who becomes pregnant while taking thesedrugs should check with her physician immediately.Cholestyramine and colestipol will not directly harm\nan unborn baby, because these drugs are not taken intothe body. However, the drugs may keep the mother’sbody from absorbing vitamins that she and the baby\nneed. Pregnant women who take these drugs should asktheir physicians whether they need to take extra vitamins.\nBREASTFEEDING. Because cholestyramine and cole-\nstipol interfere with the absorption of vitamins, womenwho use these drugs while breastfeeding should ask theirphysicians if they need to take extra vitamins.\nWomen who are breastfeeding should talk to their\nphysicians before using gemfibrozil. Whether this drugpasses into breast milk is not known. But because animalstudies suggest that it may increase the risk of sometypes of cancer , women should carefully consider the\nsafety of using it while breastfeeding.\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin,\npravastatin, fluvastatin and simvastatin) should not beused by women who are breastfeeding their babies.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Cholesterol-reduc-\ning drugs may make some medical problems worse.Before using these drugs, people with any of these med-ical conditions should make sure their physicians areaware of their conditions:\n• stomach problems, including stomach ulcer\n•constipation\n• hemorrhoids•gallstones or gallbladder disease\n• bleeding problems\n• underactive thyroid\n• heart or blood vessel disease\nIn addition, people with kidney or liver disease may\nbe more likely to have blood problems or other sideeffects when they take certain cholesterol-reducingdrugs. And some drugs of this type may actually raisecholesterol levels in people with liver disease.\nPatients with any of the following medical condi-\ntions may develop problems that could lead to kidneyfailure if they take HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors:\n• treatments to prevent rejection after an organ transplant\n• recent major surgery\n• seizures (convulsions) that are not well controlled\nPeople with phenylketonuria (PKU) should be\naware that sugar-free formulations of some cholesterol-reducing drugs contain phenylalanine in aspartame. Thisingredient can cause problems in people who havephenylketonuria.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 790Cholesterol-reducing drugsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 790USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Cholesterol-reducing\ndrugs may change the effects of other medicines. Patientsshould not take any other medicine that has not been pre-scribed or approved by a physician who knows they aretaking cholesterol-reducing drugs.\nSide effects\nGemfibrozil\nStudies in animals and humans suggest that gemfi-\nbrozil increases the risk of some types of cancer. The drugmay also cause gallstones or muscle problems. Patientswho need to take this medicine should ask their physi-cians for the latest information on its benefits and risks.\nPatients taking gemfibrozil should check with a\nphysician immediately if any of these side effects occur:\n• fever or chills• severe stomach pain with nausea and vomiting\n• pain in the lower back or side\n• pain or difficulty when urinating• cough or hoarseness\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\nThese drugs may damage the liver or muscles.\nPatients who take the drugs should have blood tests tocheck for liver damage as often as their physician recom-mends. Any unexplained pain, tenderness or weakness inthe muscles should be reported to the physician at once.\nAll cholesterol-reducing drugs\nMinor side effects such as heartburn ,indigestion ,\nbelching, bloating, gas, nausea or vomiting, stomachpain, dizziness and headache usually go away as the\nbody adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treat-ment unless they continue or they interfere with normalactivities.\nPatients who have constipation while taking choles-\nterol-reducing drugs should bring the problem to a physi-cian’s attention as soon as possible.\nAdditional side effects are possible. Anyone who has\nunusual symptoms while taking cholesterol-reducingdrugs should get in touch with his or her physician.\nInteractions\nCholesterol-reducing drugs may interact with other\nmedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects maybe greater.

Totalserum cholesterol (TC) is the measurement routinely taken.Doctors sometimes order a complete lipoprotein profile tobetter evaluate the risk for atherosclerosis (coronary\nartery disease , or CAD). The full lipoprotein profile also\nincludes measurements of triglyceride levels (a chemicalcompound that forms 95% of the fats and oils stored in ani-mal or vegetable cells) and lipoproteins (high density andlow density). Blood fats are also called “lipids.”\nThe type of cholesterol in the blood is as important as\nthe total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty substance and can-not be dissolved in water. It must combine with a proteinmolecule called a lipoprotein in order to be transported inthe blood. There are five major types of lipoproteins in thehuman body; they differ in the amount of cholesterol thatthey carry in comparison to other fats and fatty acids, andin their functions in the body. Lipoproteins are classified,as follows, according to their density:\n• Chylomicrons. These are normally found in the blood\nonly after a person has eaten foods containing fats.They contain about 7% cholesterol. Chylomicronstransport fats and cholesterol from the intestine into theliver and then into the bloodstream. They are metabo-lized in the process of carrying food energy to muscleand fat cells.\n• Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These lipopro-\nteins carry mostly triglycerides, but they also contain16–22% cholesterol. VLDLs are made in the liver andeventually become IDL particles after they have losttheir triglyceride content.\n• Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL). IDLs are\nshort-lived lipoproteins containing about 30% choles-terol that are converted in the liver to low-densitylipoproteins (LDLs).\n• Low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL molecules carry\ncholesterol from the liver to other body tissues. Theycontain about 50% cholesterol. Extra LDLs are absorbedby the liver and their cholesterol is excreted into the bile.LDL particles are involved in the formation of plaques(abnormal deposits of cholesterol) in the walls of thecoronary arteries. LDL is known as “bad cholesterol.”\n• High-density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL molecules are\nmade in the intestines and the liver. HDLs are about50% protein and 19% cholesterol. They help to removecholesterol from artery walls. Lifestyle changes,including exercising, keeping weight within recom-mended limits, and giving up smoking can increase the\nbody’s levels of HDL cholesterol. HDL is known as“good cholesterol.”\nBecause of the difference in density and cholesterol\ncontent of lipoproteins, two patients with the same totalcholesterol level can have very different lipid profilesand different risk for CAD. The critical factor is the levelof HDL cholesterol in the blood serum. Some doctorsuse the ratio of the total cholesterol level to HDL choles-terol when assessing the patient’s degree of risk. A lowTC/HDL ratio is associated with a lower degree of risk.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the TC test is to measure the levels\nof cholesterol in the patient’s blood. The patient’s choles-terol can also be fractionated (separated into differentportions) in order to determine the TC/HDL ratio. Theresults help the doctor to assess the patient’s risk forcoronary artery disease (CAD). High LDL levels areassociated with increased risk of CAD whereas highHDL levels are associated with relatively lower risk.\nIn addition, the results of the cholesterol test can\nassist the doctor in evaluating the patient’s metabolism offat, or in diagnosing inflammation of the pancreas, liverdisease, or disorders of the thyroid gland.\nThe frequency of cholesterol testing depends on the\npatient’s degree of risk for CAD. People with low choles-terol levels may need to be tested once every five years.People with high levels of blood cholesterol should betested more frequently, according to their doctor’s advice.The doctor may recommend a detailed evaluation of thedifferent types of lipids in the patient’s blood. It is ideal tocheck the HDL and triglycerides as well as the cholesteroland LDL. In addition, the National Cholesterol EducationProgram (NCEP) suggests further evaluation if the patienthas any of the symptoms of CAD or if she or he has twoor more of the following risk factors for CAD:\n• male sex\n• high blood pressure• smoking\n• diabetes\n• low HDL levels• family history of CAD before age 55\nPrecautions\nPatients who are seriously ill or hospitalized for\nsurgery should not be given cholesterol tests because theresults will not indicate the patient’s normal cholesterollevel. Acute illness, high fever ,starvation , or recent\nsurgery lowers blood cholesterol levels.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 792Cholesterol testGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 792Description\nThe cholesterol test requires a sample of the\npatient’s blood. Fasting before the test is required to get\nan accurate triglyceride and LDL level. The blood iswithdrawn by the usual vacuum tube technique from oneof the patient’s veins. The blood test takes between threeand five minutes.\nPreparation\nPatients who are scheduled for a lipid profile test\nshould fast (except for water) for 12–14 hours before theblood sample is drawn. If the patient’s cholesterol is tobe fractionated, he or she should also avoid alcohol for24 hours before the test.\nPatients should also stop taking any medications that\nmay affect the accuracy of the test results. These includecorticosteroids , estrogen or androgens, oral contracep-\ntives , some diuretics , haloperidol, some antibiotics , and\nniacin. Antilipemics are drugs that lower the concentra-tion of fatty substances in the blood. When these aretaken by the patient, blood testing may be done frequent-ly to evaluate the liver function as well as lipids. Thepatient’s doctor will give the patient a list of specificmedications to be discontinued before the test.\nAftercare\nAftercare includes routine care of the skin around the\nneedle puncture. Most patients have no aftereffects, butKEY TERMS\nAtherosclerosis —A disease of the coronary arteries\nin which cholesterol is deposited in plaques on thearterial walls. The plaque narrows or blocks bloodflow to the heart. Atherosclerosis is sometimescalled coronary artery disease, or CAD.\nFractionation —A laboratory test or process in\nwhich blood or another fluid is broken down intoits components. Fractionation can be used to assessthe proportions of the different types of cholesterolin a blood sample.\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) —A type of lipopro-\ntein that protects against CAD by removing choles-terol deposits from arteries or preventing their for-mation.\nHypercholesterolemia —The presence of excessive-\nly high levels of cholesterol in the blood.\nLipid —Any organic compound that is greasy, insol-uble in water, but soluble in alcohol. Fats, waxes,\nand oils are examples of lipids.\nLipoprotein —A complex molecule that consists of\na protein membrane surrounding a core of lipids.Lipoproteins carry cholesterol and other lipids fromthe digestive tract to the liver and other body tis-sues. There are five major types of lipoproteins.\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) —A type of lipopro-\ntein that consists of about 50% cholesterol and isassociated with an increased risk of CAD.\nPlaque —An abnormal deposit of hardened choles-\nterol on the wall of an artery.\nTriglyceride —A chemical compound that forms\nabout 95% of the fats and oils stored in animal andvegetable cells. Triglyceride levels are sometimesmeasured as well as cholesterol when a patient isscreened for heart disease.\nsome may have a small bruise or swelling. A washcloth\nsoaked in warm water usually relieves any discomfort. Inaddition, the patient should resume taking any prescrip-tion medications that were discontinued before the test.\nRisks\nThe primary risk to the patient is a mild stinging or\nburning sensation during the venipuncture, with minorswelling or bruising afterward.\nNormal results\nThe “normal” values for serum lipids depend on the\npatient’s age, sex, and race. Normal values for people inWestern countries are usually given as 140–220 mg/dL inadults, although as many as 5% of the population has TChigher than 300 mg/dL. Among Asians, the figures areabout 20% lower. As a rule, both TC and LDL levels riseas people get older.\nSome doctors prefer to speak of “desired” rather\nthan “normal” cholesterol values, on the grounds that“normal” refers to statistically average levels that maystill be too high for good health. Desirable values are asfollows:\n• Total cholesterol (TC): less than 200 mg/dL• HDL cholesterol: 40–70 mg/dL in males, 40–80 mg/dL\nin females\n• LDL cholesterol: less than 130 mg/dL\n• TC/HDL ratio: under 4.0 in males, 3.8 in females.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 793Cholesterol testGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 793Abnormal results\nIt is possible for blood cholesterol levels to be too\nlow as well as too high.\nAbnormally low levels\nTC levels less than 160 mg/dL are associated with\nhigher mortality rates from cancer , liver disease, respira-\ntory disorders, and injuries. The connection betweenunusually low cholesterol and increased mortality is notclear, although some researchers think that the low levelis a secondary sign of the underlying disease and not thecause of disease or death .\nLow levels of serum cholesterol are also associated\nwith malnutrition or hyperthyroidism . Further diagnos-\ntic testing may be necessary in order to locate the cause.\nAbnormally high levels\nPrior to 1980, hypercholesterolemia (an abnormal-\nly high TC level) was defined as any value above the95th percentile for the population. These figures rangedfrom 210 mg/dL in persons younger than 20 to more than280 mg/dL in persons older than 60. It is now known,however, that TC levels over 200 mg/dL are associatedwith significantly higher risk of CAD. Levels of 280mg/dL or more are considered elevated. Treatment withdiet and medication has proven to successfully lower riskof heart attack and stroke .\nElevated cholesterol levels may also result from\nhepatitis, blockage of the bile ducts, disorders of lipidmetabolism, nephrotic syndrome , inflammation of the\npancreas, or hypothyroidism .\nResources\nBOOKS\nBaron, Robert B., and Warren S.

    "title": "Cholinergic drugs",
    "content": "Cholinergic drugs\nDefinition\nCholinergic drugs are medications that produce the\nsame effects as the parasympathetic nervous system.Purpose\nCholinergic drugs produce the same effects as acetyl-\ncholine. Acetylcholine is the most common neurohor-mone of the parasympathetic nervous system, the part ofthe peripheral nervous system responsible for the everyday work of the body. While the sympathetic nervous sys-tem acts during times of excitation, the parasympatheticsystem deals with everyday activities such as salivation,digestion, and muscle relaxation.\nThe cholinergic drugs may be used in several ways.\nThe cholinergic muscle stimulants are used to diagnose andtreat myathenia gravis, a disease that causes severe muscleweakness. This class of drugs includes ambenonium chlo-ride (Mytelase), edrophonium chloride (Tensilon), neostig-mine (Prostigmine), and piridogstimina (Mestinón). Thesedrugs are also widely used in surgery, both to reduce therisk of urinary retention, and to reverse the effects of themuscle relaxant drugs that are used in surgery.\nCholinergic drugs are also used in control of glauco-\nma, a disease that is caused by increased pressure inside\nthe eye. The most common drugs used for this purposeare demecarium (Humorsol) and echthiophate (Phospho-line iodide).\nDescription\nCholinergic drugs usually act in one of two ways.\nSome directly mimic the effect of acetylcholine, whileothers block the effects of acetylcholinesterase. Acetyl-cholinesterase is an enzyme that destroys naturallyoccurring acetylcholine. By blocking the enzyme, thenaturally occurring acetylcholine has a longer action.\nRecommended dosage\nCholinergic drugs are available only by prescription.\nThey may be available as eye drops, capsules, tablets, orinjections.\nPrecautions\nCholinergic drugs should be avoided when the\npatient has any sort of obstruction in the urinary or diges-tive tracts, such a a tumor, or severe inflammation whichis causing blockage.\nThey should be used with caution in patients with\nasthma , epilepsy, slow heart beat, hyperthyroidism ,o r\ngastric ulcers.\nThe effects of the cholinergic drugs are to produce\nthe same effects as stimulation of the parasympatheticnervous system. These effects include slowing of theheartbeat, increases in normal secretions including the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 794Cholinergic drugsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 794digestive acids of the stomach, saliva and tears. For this\nreason, patients who already have a problem in one ofthese areas, such as a slow heartbeat or stomach ulcersshould use these drugs with great caution, since the med-ication will make their conditions worse.\nSide effects\nWhen used properly, cholinergic drugs will increase\nmuscle strength in patients with myasthenia gravis . In\neye drop form, they can reduce the intraoccular pressurein glaucoma.\nThe possible adverse effects of cholinergic drugs are:\n• slow heart beat, possibly leading to cardiac arrest\n• muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and muscle pain\n• convulsions\n• weak breathing, inability to breath\n• increased stomach acid and saliva\n• nausea and vomiting\n• dizziness, drowsiness, and headache\nResources\nBOOKS\nBeyond the Limits: A Self Portrait of Myasthenia Gravis.\nSusanville, CA: Palette-Publishing, March 1994.\nPERIODICALS\n“Classic Papers in Glaucoma.” Archives of Ophthalmology\n(March 2001).KEY TERMS\nCholinergic —Nerves that are stimulated by acetyl-\ncholine.\nGlaucoma —a disease of the eye marked by\nincreased pressure within the eyeball that canresult in damage to the optic disk and gradual lossof vision.\nMyasthenia gravis —a disease characterized by pro-\ngressive weakness and exhaustibility of voluntarymuscles without atrophy or sensory disturbanceand caused by an autoimmune attack on acetyl-choline receptors at neuromuscular junctions.\nParasympathetic nervous system —the part of the\nnervous system that contains chiefly cholinergicfibers, that tends to induce secretion, to increasethe tone and contractility of smooth muscle, andto slow the heart rate.“Congenital myasthenic syndromes: recent advances.”\nArchives of Neurology (February 1999).\nSamuel Uretsky, PharmD"

    "title": "Chondromalacia patellae",
    "content": "Chondromalacia patellae\nDefinition\nChondromalacia patellae refers to the progressive\nerosion of the articular cartilage of the knee joint, that isthe cartilage underlying the kneecap (patella) that articu-lates with the knee joint.\nDescription\nChondromalacia patellae (CMP), also known as\npatello-femoral pain syndrome or patello-femoral stress\nsyndrome, is a syndrome that causes pain/discomfort atthe front of the knee. It is associated with irritation orwear on the underside of the kneecap, or patella. In a nor-mal knee, the articular cartilage is smooth and elastic andglides smoothly over the surface of the thighbone, orfemur when the knee is bent. Erosion of the cartilageroughens the surface and prevents this smooth action.\nCMP is most common in adolescent females,\nalthough older people may also develop it. An average oftwo out of 10,000 people develop this condition, many ofthem runners or other athletes.\nCauses and symptoms\nCMP is the result of the normal aging process,\noveruse, injury, or uneven pressures exerted on the kneejoint. In teens, CMP may be caused by uneven growth oruneven strength in the thigh muscles. Growth spurts,common in teens, may result in a mildly abnormal align-ment of the patella, which increases the angle formed bythe thigh and the patellar tendon (Q-angle). This condi-tion adds to the damage. Symptoms include pain, nor-mally around the kneecap, and a grinding sensation feltwhen extending the leg. The pain may radiate to the backof the knee, or it may be intermittent and brought on bysquatting, kneeling, going up or down stairs, especiallydown, or by repeated bending of the joint.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is established during a physical examina-\ntion performed by a general practitioner or an orthope-\ndist, and is based on frequency of symptoms and con-firmed by x rays of the knee. The CMP erosion can also\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 795Chondromalacia patellaeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 795be seen on an MRI, although this type of scan is not rou-\ntinely performed for this purpose. The patient shouldinform the doctor about any previous injuries to the joint.\nTreatment\nInitial treatment may consist of resting the knee\nusing crutches, along with aspirin , Tylenol, or a non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such asMotrin for seven to 10 days. The person should limitsports activity until the joint is healed and may use icefollowed by heat to decrease inflammation. When thedoctor allows the patient to resume sports, a knee bracemay be prescribed in the form of a stabilizer with a holeat the kneecap.\nTreatment also includes low impact exercises to\nstrengthen the quadriceps muscles which help stabilizethe knee joint. Physical therapy may be suggested at thestart of this program so as to help the patient learn thecorrect method of performing the exercises.\nApproximately 85% of people do well with conserv-\native CMP treatment. The remainder still have severepain and may require arthroscopic surgery to repair the\ntissues inside the knee joint. In more severe cases, opensurgery may be required to realign the kneecap and per-haps other corrections.\nAlternative treatments\nPhysical therapy offers treatments that may help\nCMP patients. Aqua therapy has the benefit of exercisingthe knee without putting stress on it and it also strength-ens the thigh muscles. Biofeedback can be used to learn\ntensing and relaxing specific muscles to relieve pain.These techniques have the benefit of no side effects.Massage therapy might be beneficial as well. Calcium,\nminerals , and vitamins as part of a balanced diet will\naid healing and help prevent further problems.KEY TERMS\nArthroscopic knee surgery —Surgery performed to\nexamine or repair tissues inside the knee jointthrough a special scope (arthroscope).\nFemur —The thigh bone.\nIsometric exercises —Exercises which strengthen\nthrough muscle resistance.\nOsteoarthritis —Degenerative joint disease.\nQuadriceps, hip flexors, hamstrings —Major mus-\ncles in the thigh area which affect knee mechanics.Prognosis\nIn most teens with CMP, the prognosis is excellent\nsince the damage is reversible when treatment startsbefore the cartilage begins to break down. With propertreatment and preventive techniques, teenagers will com-plete their growth without permanent damage to thejoint. Only about 15% of patients require surgical inter-vention. Older people may go on to develop osteoarthri-\ntisin the knee.\nPrevention\nProper exercises are the best preventive measure.\nSince tightness of thigh muscles is a risk factor, warmingup before athletic activities is recommended, as well asparticipating in a variety of sports rather than just one.Stretching exercises increase flexibility of the quadri-ceps, hip flexors, and hamstrings. Strengthening exercis-es such as short arc leg extensions, straight leg raises,quadriceps isometric exercises, and stationary bicyclingare also recommended.\nResources\nOTHER\nChondromalacia patellae. <http://my.webmd.com/content/\nasset/adam_disease_chondromalacia_patellae>.\nChondromalacia Patellae. <http://www.orthoseek.com/articles/\nchondromp.html>.\n“Major Domains of Complementary & Alternative Medicine.”\n<http://nccam.nih.gov/fcp/classify/>.\nQuestions and Answers About Knee Problems. <http://www.\ncbshealthwatch.com/cx/viewarticle/202777>.\nQuestions and Answers About Knee Problems. <http://www.\nnih.gov/niams/healthinfo/kneeprobs/kneeqa.htm>.\nBarbara J.

Most of these cancers form inside\nthe reproductive organs. Some originate in the testes orovaries, especially in young adults. Others develop in theuterus after a pregnancy or miscarriage—particularly\noften after a mole. A few choriocarcinomas arise in sitesoutside the reproductive organs. Such “extragonadal”tumors are usually found in young adults and are morecommon in males.\nChoriocarcinomas are one of the most dangerous\ngerm cell cancers. Choriocarcinomas usually growquickly and spread widely. Occasionally, this cancergrows so fast that the original tumor outgrows its bloodsupply and dies, leaving behind only a small scar.\nCauses and symptoms\nChoriocarcinomas result from genetic damage to a\ngerm cell. Males with Klinefelter syndrome are espe-\ncially likely to develop extragonadal germ cell tumors.\nThe symptoms of a choriocarcinoma vary, depend-\ning on where the tumor originates and where it spreads.In the uterus, the most common symptom is bleeding.Cancers in the ovary often have only subtle signs such asKEY TERMS\nBiopsy —A sample of an organ taken to look for\nabnormalities.

In the testes, chorio-\ncarcinomas can often be felt as small painless lumps.Choriocarcinomas that spread to other organs may revealtheir presence by bleeding. In the brain, this bleeding cancause a stroke .\nDiagnosis\nChoriocarcinomas are usually referred to an\noncologist, a doctor who specializes in cancer treat-ment. To diagnose this tumor, the doctor will do aphysical examination and examine the internal\norgans with x rays or ultrasound studies. Choriocarci-nomas are not always biopsied before being treated,because they tend to bleed heavily. Spreading of thecancer is detected with x rays, ultrasound studies,computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) scans.\nMost choriocarcinomas make human chorionic\ngonadotropin (hCG), a hormone normally found onlyduring pregnancy. The presence of hCG in the blood canhelp diagnose this cancer and monitor the success oftreatment.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 797ChoriocarcinomaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 797Treatment\nChoriocarcinomas are usually treated by surgical\nremoval of the tumor and chemotherapy . Radiation is\noccasionally used, particularly for tumors in the brain.\nAlternative treatment\nComplementary treatments can decrease stress ,\nreduce the side effects of cancer treatment, and helppatients feel more in control. For instance, some peoplefind activities such as yoga , massage, music therapy ,\nmeditation , prayer, or mild physical exercise helpful.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for choriocarcinomas in the uterus is\nvery good. Although these tumors have often spreadthroughout the body, chemotherapy results in a cure orremission in at least 80–90% of cases. Women who havehad choriocarcinomas often go on to have normal preg-nancies and deliveries.\nChoriocarcinomas in other sites have a poorer prog-\nnosis. These tumors tend to spread quickly and don’talways respond well to chemotherapy. Although treat-ment can be effective, the outcome usually depends onhow widely the cancer is dispersed. Generally, the prog-nosis is worse if the cancer can be found in the liver orbrain, if hCG levels are high, or if the original tumordeveloped outside the gonads. Five-year survival withtesticular cancers can range from 92% for tumors thathave spread only to the lungs to 48% to tumors that havespread to other internal organs.\nPrevention\nThere is no known means of prevention.

Although it carries a slightlyhigher risk, CVS may be used in place of amniocentesis\nfor women who have one or more of the following riskfactors:\n• Women age 35 and older. The chance of having a child\nwith Down syndrome increases with maternal age. For\ninstance, the chance of having a baby with Down syn-drome is one in 378 for a 35-year-old woman andincreases to one in 30 for a 45-year-old woman.\n• A history of miscarriages or children born with birth\ndefects .\n• A family history of genetic disease.

It is not typically recommended for women\nwho have Rh sensitization from a previous pregnancy.\nDescription\nChorionic villus sampling has been in use since the\n1980s. This prenatal testing procedure involves taking asample of the chorion frondosum—that part of the chori-onic membrane containing the villi—for laboratoryanalysis. The chorionic membrane is the outer sac whichsurrounds the developing fetus. Chorionic villi aremicroscopic, finger-like projections that emerge from thechorionic membrane and eventually form the placenta.The cells that make up the chorionic villi are of fetal ori-gin so laboratory analysis can identify any genetic, chro-mosomal, or biochemical diseases of the fetus.Chorionic villus sampling is best performed\nbetween 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure isperformed either through the vagina and the cervix(transcervically) or through the abdomen (transabdomi-nally) depending upon the preferences of the patient orthe doctor. In some cases, the location of the placentadictates which method the doctor uses. Both methods areequally safe and effective. Following the preparationtime, both procedures take only about five minutes.Women undergoing chorionic villus sampling may expe-rience no pain at all or feel cramping or pinching. Occa-\nsionally, a second sampling procedure must be per-formed if insufficient villus material was obtained.\nFor the transcervical procedure, the woman lies on\nan examining table on her back with her feet in stirrups.The woman’s vaginal area is thoroughly cleansed with anantiseptic, a sterile speculum is inserted into her vaginaand opened, and the cervix is cleansed with an antiseptic.Using ultrasound (a device which uses sound waves tovisualize internal organs) as a guide, the doctor inserts athin, plastic tube called a catheter through the cervix andinto the uterus.

In the transcervical procedure, as depicted above, the physician uses ultrasound to help guide a catheterthrough the cervix into the uterus. By applying suction from the syringe attached to the other end of the catheter, a smallsample of the chorionic villi are obtained.

The doctor carefully watch-\nes the image produced by the ultrasound and advancesthe catheter to the chorionic villi. By applying suctionfrom the syringe attached to the other end of the catheter,a small sample of the chorionic villi are obtained. Acramping or pinching feeling may be felt as the sample isbeing taken. The catheter is then easily withdrawn.\nFor the transabdominal method, the woman lies on\nher back on an examining table. Ultrasound enables thedoctor to locate the placenta. The specific area on thewoman’s abdomen is cleansed thoroughly with an anti-septic and a local anesthetic may be injected to numb thearea. With ultrasound guidance, a long needle is insertedthrough the woman’s abdominal wall, through the uterinewall and to the chorionic villi. The sample is obtained byapplying suction from the syringe.\nThe chorionic villus sample is immediately placed\ninto nutrient medium and sent to the laboratory.

Chorionic villi are offetal origin and eventually form the placenta.\nChromosomes —Human cells carry DNA in tightly\ncompressed rod-like structures called chromo-somes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomesincluding the sex chromosomes.\nDown syndrome —A chromosomal disorder\ncaused by an extra copy or a rearrangement ofchromosome 21. Children with Down syndromehave varying degrees of mental retardation andmay have heart defects.\nFetus —Term for an unborn baby after the eighth\nweek of pregnancy. Prior to seven weeks, it iscalled an embryo.\nRh sensitization —A woman with a negative blood\ntype (Rh negative) who has produced antibodiesagainst her fetus with a positive blood type (Rhpositive). The mother’s body considered the fetalblood cells a foreign object and mounted animmune attack on it.\nUltrasound —A safe, painless procedure which\nuses sound waves to visualize internal organs. Awand that transmits and receives the sound wavesis moved over the woman’s abdomen and internalorgans can be seen on a video screen.oratory, the sample is examined under the microscope and\nany contaminating cells or material is carefully removed.The villi can be analyzed immediately, or incubated for aday or more to allow for cell division. The cells arestopped in the midst of cell division and spread onto amicroscope slide. Cells with clearly separated chromo-somes are photographed so that the type and number ofchromosomes can be analyzed. Chromosomes are stringsof DNA which have been tightly compressed. Humanshave 23 pairs of chromosomes including the sex chromo-somes. Rearrangements of the chromosomes or the pres-ence of additional or fewer chromosomes can be identifiedby examination of the photograph. Down syndrome, forinstance, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. Inaddition to the chromosomal analysis, specialized tests canbe performed as needed to look for specific diseases suchas Tay-Sachs disease . Depending upon which tests are\nperformed, results may be available as early as two days orup to eight days after the procedure.\nChorionic villus sampling costs between $1,200 and\n$1,800. Insurance coverage for this test may vary.\nAlternate procedures\nThere are alternate procedures for diagnosing genet-\nic and chromosomal disorders of the fetus. Amniocente-sis is commonly used and involves inserting a needlethrough the pregnant woman’s abdomen to obtain a sam-ple of amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is usually per-formed in the second trimester at approximately 16weeks gestation and the laboratory analysis may take twoto three weeks. The two advantages of chorionic villussampling are that it is performed during the first trimesterand the results are available in about one week. However,as of 1997, amniocentesis is being performed in the firsttrimester, but this is still very rare. The risk of miscar-\nriage after amniocentesis is 0.5–1% (one to two women\nout of 200) which is lower than that for chorionic villussampling (1–3%).\nA noninvasive alternative is the maternal blood test\ncalled triple marker screening or multiple marker screen-ing. A sample of the pregnant woman’s blood is analyzedfor three different markers: alphafetoprotein (AFP),human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol.The levels of these three markers in the mother’s bloodcan identify unborn babies who are at risk for certaingenetic or chromosomal defects. This is a screening testwhich determines the chance that the fetus has the defect,but it can not diagnose defects. A negative test resultdoes not necessarily mean the unborn baby does not havea birth defect. For instance, this screening test can onlypredict 60–70% of the fetuses with Down syndrome.Pregnant women who have a positive triple marker\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 800Chorionic villus samplingGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 800screen are encouraged to undergo a diagnostic test, such\nas amniocentesis (by the time an AFP is done, it is toolate to perform a CVS).\nPreparation\nPrior to the chorionic villus sampling procedure the\nwoman needs to drink fluids and refrain from urinatingto ensure her bladder is full. These preparations create abetter ultrasound picture.\nAftercare\nIt is generally recommended that women undergoing\nchorionic villus sampling have someone drive themhome and have no plans for the rest of the day. Womenwith Rh negative blood must receive a Rho (D) immuneglobulin injection following the procedure. Womenshould call their doctor if they experience excessivebleeding, vaginal discharge, fever , or abdominal pain\nafter the procedure.\nRisks\nOf women who undergo transcervical chorionic vil-\nlus sampling, one third experience minimal vaginal spot-ting and 7–10% experience vaginal bleeding. One out offive women experience cramping following the proce-dure. Two to three women out of 100 (or 2–3%) will mis-carry following chorionic villus sampling. The risk ofinfection is very low. Rupture of the amniotic mem-branes is a rare complication. Women with Rh negativeblood may be at an increased risk for developing Rhincompatibility following chorionic villus sampling.\nThere have been reports of limb defects in babies\nfollowing chorionic villus sampling. However, in 1996the World Health Organization reported that the inci-dence of babies born with limb defects from 138,966women who had undergone chorionic villus samplingwas the same as for women who had not. Therefore, thisstudy found no connection between chorionic villus sam-pling and limb defects.\nNormal results\nNo genetic, chromosomal, or biochemical abnor-\nmalities were found in the fetal cells. The gender of thefetus will be identified but will be made known to theparents only with their approval.\nAbnormal results\nAnalysis of the cells from the chorionic villus\nenables the detection of over 200 diseases and disorderssuch as Down Syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, and cysticfibrosis . Gross rearrangements of the chromosomes and\nchromosome additions or losses are detected.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEisenberg, E., et. al.

    "content": "Chronic fatigue syndrome\nDefinition\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition that\ncauses extreme tiredness. People with CFS have debili-tating fatigue that lasts for six months or longer. Theyalso have many other symptoms. Some of these are pain\nin the joints and muscles, headache , and sore throat .\nCFS does not have a known cause, but appears to resultfrom a combination of factors.\nDescription\nCFS is the most common name for this disorder, but\nit also has been called chronic fatigue and immune disor-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 801Chronic fatigue syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 801der (CFIDS), myalgic encephalomyelitis, low natural\nkiller cell disease, post-viral syndrome, Epstein-Barr dis-ease, and Yuppie flu. CFS has so many names becauseresearchers have been unable to find out exactly whatcauses it and because there are many similar, overlappingconditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome calledneurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi-lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because\none of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain.Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia andCFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes.\nIn the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of\nCFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found thatmany people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to theEpstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, intheir blood. For a while they thought they had found theculprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also hadhigh EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levelsof other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS.These findings have led many scientists to believe that avirus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS.\nCFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because\nit seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession-als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age,race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can getCFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25–45 yearsold, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates ofhow many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to thesimilarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif-ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo-ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. Accordingto the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in theUnited States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. Thisprobably is a low estimate since these figures do notinclude children and are based on the CDC definition ofCFS, which is very strict for research purposes.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere is no single known cause for CFS. Studies\nhave pointed to several different conditions that might beresponsible. These include:\n• viral infections\n• chemical toxins•allergies\n• immune abnormalities\n• psychological disorders\nAlthough the cause is still controversial, many doc-\ntors and researchers now think that CFS may not be asingle illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group ofsymptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is\nthat a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemicalinjures the body and damages the immune system, allow-ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of allpeople have a virus in the herpes family dormant (notactively growing or reproducing) in their bodies sincechildhood. When these viruses start growing again, theimmune system may overreact and produce chemicalscalled cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms.Immune abnormalities have been found in studies ofpeople with CFS, although the same abnormalities arealso found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis-eases, cancer , and other disorders.\nThe role of psychological problems in CFS is very\ncontroversial. Because many people with CFS are diag-nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders,some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS arepsychological. However, many people with CFS did nothave psychological disorders before getting the illness.Many doctors think that patients become depressed oranxious because of the effects of the symptoms of theirCFS. One recent study concluded that depression was theresult of CFS and was not its cause.\nHaving CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo-\nple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them fromperforming their normal daily activities. They find it dif-ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even totake part in social activities. They may have sleep distur-bances that keep them from getting enough rest or theymay sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just astired after a full night’s sleep as before they went to bed.When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their\nfatigue, people with CFS experience what some patientscall “payback”—debilitating exhaustion that can confinethem to bed for days.\nOther symptoms of CFS include:\n• muscle pain (myalgia)\n• joint pain (arthralgia)\n• sore throat• headache\n•fever and chills\n• tender lymph nodes• trouble concentrating\n• memory loss\nA recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an\nabnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23patients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurallymediated hypotension , causes a sudden drop in blood\npressure when a person has been standing, exercising orexposed to heat for a while. When this occurs, patients\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 802Chronic fatigue syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 802feel lightheaded and may faint. They often are exhausted\nfor hours to days after one of these episodes. When treat-ed with salt and medications to stabilize blood pressure,many patients in the study had marked improvements intheir CFS symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nCFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim-\ninating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques-tion patients about their symptoms, any other illnessesthey have had, and medications they are taking. Theyalso conduct a physical examination , neurological\nexamination, and laboratory tests to identify any underly-ing disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In theUnited States, many doctors use the CDC case definitionto determine if a patient has CFS.\nTo be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both\nof the following criteria:\n• Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue for\nat least six months that is of new or definite onset, is notthe result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainlyrelieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational,social, or personal activities to be greatly reduced.\n• Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short-\nterm memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tenderlymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain withoutswelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, orseverity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise(a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness followingexercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting morethan 24 hours. These symptoms must have continued orrecurred during six or more consecutive months of illnessand must not have started before the fatigue began.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are\navailable to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual-ly are individualized to each person’s particular symp-toms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom-mend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanceddiet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, andresting when needed are key to maintaining existingenergy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps tokeep patients from losing physical conditioning, but toomuch exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp-toms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also\nmay help some people with CFS.\nMany medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal\npreparations have been used to treat CFS. While many ofthese are unproven, others seem to provide some peoplewith relief. People with CFS should discuss their treatmentKEY TERMS\nArthralgia —Joint pain.\nCytokines —Proteins produced by certain types of\nlymphocytes.

Antianxiety drugs , such as benzodi-\nazepines or buspirone may be prescribed for excessive\nanxiety that has lasted for at least six months.\nOther medications that have been tested or are being\ntested for treatment of CFS are:\n• Fludrocortisone (Florinef), a synthetic steroid, which is\ncurrently being tested for treatment of people withCFS. It causes the body to retain salt, thereby increas-ing blood pressure. It has helped some people with CFSwho have neurally mediated hypotension.\n• Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, often prescribed for high\nblood pressure. Such drugs, including atenolol (Tenoretic,Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal), are sometimes pre-scribed for neurally mediated hypotension.\n• Gamma globulin, which contains human antibodies to a\nvariety of organisms that cause infection. It has beenused experimentally to boost immune function in peo-ple with CFS.\n• Ampligen, a drug which stimulates the immune system\nand has antiviral activity. In one small study, ampligenimproved mental function in people with CFS.\nAlternative treatment\nA variety of nutritional supplements are used for\ntreatment of CFS. Among these are vitamin C, vitaminB\n12, vitamin A, vitamin E, and various dietary minerals .\nThese supplements may help improve immune and men-tal functions. Several herbs have been shown to improveimmune function and have other beneficial effects. Somethat are used for CFS are astragalus ( Astragalus mem-\nbranaceus ),echinacea (Echinacea spp.), garlic ( Allium\nsativum ), ginseng ( Panax ginseng ), gingko ( Gingko bilo-\nba), evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis ), shiitake\nmushroom extract ( Lentinus edodes ), borage seed oil,\nand quercetin.\nMany people have enhanced their healing process\nfor CFS with the use of a treatment program inclusive ofone or more alternative therapies. Stress reduction tech-\nniques such as biofeedback ,meditation ,acupuncture ,\nand yoga may help people with sleep disturbances relax\nand get more rest. They also help some people reducedepression and anxiety caused by CFS.\nPrognosis\nThe course of CFS varies widely for different peo-\nple. Some people get progressively worse over time,while others gradually improve. Some individuals haveperiods of illness that alternate with periods of goodhealth. While many people with CFS never fully regaintheir health, they find relief from symptoms and adapt tothe demands of the disorder by carefully following a\ntreatment plan combining adequate rest, nutrition ,e x e r -\ncise, and other therapies.\nPrevention\nBecause the cause of CFS is not known, there current-\nly are no recommendations for preventing the disorder.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDemitrack, Mark A., and Susan E.

Females have two copies ofthe X chromosome, whereas males have one X andone Y . CGD also is a recessive defect meaning thatboth copies of the chromosome must have the defectbefore it can be expressed. Females who have one Xchromosome without the defect do not get this dis-ease. Males, since they only have one X chromosome,get the disease if the defect is present. Thus, CGDaffects mostly males.\nCGD is an immunodeficiency disorder. Patients\nwith immunodeficiency disorders suffer frequent infec-tions. This happens because part of their immune systemisn’t working properly and the infectious microorgan-isms are not killed as rapidly as is normal. In CGD thereis a defect in the ability of the white blood cells to killbacteria and fungi. The white blood cells affected arephagocytic cells. They are part of the non-specificimmune system and move via the blood to all parts of thebody where they ingest and destroy microbes. Phagocyt-ic cells are the first line of defense against microorgan-isms. In this disease, the decreased ability to killmicrobes that they have ingested leads to a failure toeffectively combat infectious diseases. Patients withCGD are subject to certain types of recurring infection,especially those of the skin, lungs, mouth, nose,intestines, and lymph nodes. With the exception of thelymph nodes, all of these areas are considered externaltissues that come into contact with microorganisms fromthe environment. The lymph system drains all areas ofthe body to eliminate destroyed microorganisms and toassist the immune system in attacking microorganisms.Infections occur in the lymph nodes as a consequence ofthe normal draining function.KEY TERMS\nImmunodeficiency —A weakening of the body’s\nimmune system.\nPhagocytic cells —A cell that ingests microorgan-\nisms and foreign particles.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe genetic defect that causes CGD reduces the\namount of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide that whiteblood cells can make. These chemicals are important forkilling bacteria and fungi. Without them the white bloodcells ingest the microorganisms, but can’t kill them. Insome cases, the microbes then replicate inside the whiteblood cell eventually causing its death .\nSymptoms of the disease usually appear by age two.\nFrequent, recurrent infections of the skin, lungs (e.g.pneumonia ), mouth (e.g. gingivitis), nose, intestines and\nlymph nodes are a hallmark of this disease. Patients mayalso develop multiple, recurrent liver abscesses and boneinfections ( osteomyelitis ).\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made based on the observation of a pat-\ntern of recurrent infections. Blood tests of lymphocyteand antibody functions will be normal. Tests of phago-cytic cells will show normal ingestion, but a greatlydecreased ability to kill bacteria.\nTreatment\nEarly, aggressive treatment of all infections is criti-\ncal to the successful management of CGD. Patients aretreated with antibiotics and immune serum. Antibiotics\nare used at the first sign of infection. Immune serum is asource of antibodies that help fight infections. Interferongamma is an experimental treatment for CGD that hasshown promising results. There is no cure for the under-lying cause of chronic granulomatous disease\nPrognosis\nAlthough antibiotics can treat most infections and\nmay help prevent others, premature death may result,typically due to repeated lung infections.\nPrevention\nSince CGD is a hereditary disorder, it cannot cur-\nrently be prevented.

    "title": "Chronic kidney failure",
    "content": "Chronic kidney failure\nDefinition\nChronic kidney failure occurs when disease or disor-\nder damages the kidneys so that they are no longer capa-ble of adequately removing fluids and wastes from thebody or of maintaining the proper level of certain kidney-regulated chemicals in the bloodstream.\nDescription\nChronic kidney failure, also known as chronic renal\nfailure, affects over 250,000 Americans annually. It iscaused by a number of diseases and inherited disorders,but the progression of chronic kidney failure is always thesame. The kidneys, which serve as the body’s natural fil-tration system, gradually lose their ability to remove flu-ids and waste products (urea) from the bloodstream. Theyalso fail to regulate certain chemicals in the bloodstream,and deposit protein into the urine. Chronic kidney failureis irreversible, and will eventually lead to total kidneyfailure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Without proper treatment intervention to remove wastesand fluids from the bloodstream, ESRD is fatal.\nCauses and symptoms\nKidney failure is triggered by disease or a hereditary\ndisorder in the kidneys. Both kidneys are typically affect-ed. The four most common causes of chronic kidney fail-ure include:\n• Diabetes. Diabetes mellitus (DM), both insulin depen-\ndant (IDDM) and non-insulin dependant (NIDDM),occurs when the body cannot produce and/or useinsulin, the hormone necessary for the body to processglucose. Long-term diabetes may cause the glomeruli,the filtering units located in the nephrons of the kid-neys, to gradually lose functioning.\n•Glomerulonephritis . Glomerulonephritis is a chronic\ninflammation of the glomeruli, or filtering units of thekidney. Certain types of glomerulonephritis are treat-able, and may only cause a temporary disruption of kid-ney functioning.\n•Hypertension . High blood pressure is unique in that it\nis both a cause and a major symptom of kidney failure.The kidneys can become stressed and ultimately sustainpermanent damage from blood pushing through them atan excessive level of pressure over a long period of time.\n•Polycystic kidney disease . Polycystic kidney disease is\nan inherited disorder that causes cysts to be formed onthe nephrons, or functioning units, of the kidneys. Thecysts hamper the regular functioning of the kidney.\nOther possible causes of chronic kidney failure\ninclude kidney cancer , obstructions such as kidney\nstones ,pyelonephritis , reflux nephropathy, systemic\nlupus erythematosus ,amyloidosis , sickle cell anemia,\nAlport syndrome , and oxalosis.\nInitially, symptoms of chronic kidney failure devel-\nop slowly. Even individuals with mild to moderate kid-ney failure may show few symptoms in spite of increasedurea in their blood. Among the symptoms that may bepresent at this point are frequent urination during thenight and high blood pressure.\nMost symptoms of chronic kidney failure are not\napparent until kidney disease has progressed significant-ly. Common symptoms include:\n• Anemia. The kidneys are responsible for the production\nof erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which stimulates redblood cell production. If kidney disease causes shrinkingof the kidney, this red cell production is hampered.\n• Bad breath or a bad taste in mouth. Urea, or waste prod-\nucts, in the saliva may cause an ammonia-like taste inthe mouth.\n• Bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin\nD, which aids in the absorption of calcium and keepsbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bonesmay become brittle, and in the case of children, normalgrowth may be stunted. Joint pain may also occur as a\nresult of unchecked phosphate levels in the blood.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 806Chronic kidney failureGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 806• Edema. Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, arms,\nhands, and feet.\n• Frequent urination.\n• Foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause\nit to foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicatebleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,or ureters.\n• Headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.• Hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of\nfluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase,which in turn, causes blood pressure to rise.\n• Increased fatigue . Toxic substances in the blood and the\npresence of anemia may cause feelings of exhaustion.\n•Itching . Phosphorus, which is typically eliminated in\nthe urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with kid-ney failure. This heightened phosphorus level maycause itching of the skin.\n• Lower back pain. Pain where the kidneys are located, in\nthe small of the back below the ribs.\n• Nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Urea in the gas-\ntric juices may cause upset stomach. This can lead tomalnutrition and weight loss.\nDiagnosis\nKidney failure is typically diagnosed and treated by a\nnephrologist, a doctor that specializes in treating the kid-neys. The patient that is suspected of having chronic kid-ney failure will undergo an extensive blood work-up. Ablood test will assess the levels of creatinine, blood ureanitrogen (BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potas-sium in the blood. Urine samples will also be collected,usually over a 24-hour period, to assess protein loss.\nUncovering the cause of kidney failure is critical to\nproper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is nec-essary to determine if the underlying disease is treatableand if the kidney failure is chronic or acute. An x ray,MRI, computed tomography scan, ultrasound, renalbiopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may beemployed to determine the cause of kidney failure andlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultra-sound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be taken.\nTreatment\nChronic kidney failure is an irreversible condition.\nHemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplan-\ntation must be employed to replace the lost function of\nthe kidneys. In addition, dietary changes and treatment torelieve specific symptoms such as anemia and high bloodpressure are critical to the treatment process.KEY TERMS\nEnd-stage renal disease (ESRD) —Total kidney fail-\nure; chronic kidney failure is diagnosed as ESRDwhen kidney function falls to 5–10% of capacity.\nNephrotic syndrome —Characterized by protein\nloss in the urine, low protein levels in the blood,and fluid retention.\nUreters —The two ducts that pass urine from each\nkidney to the bladder.\nHemodialysis\nHemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed type\nof dialysis treatment in the United States. Mosthemodialysis patients require treatment three times aweek, for an average of three to four hours per dialysis“run” depending on the type of dialyzer used and theircurrent physical condition. The treatment involves circu-lating the patient’s blood outside of the body through anextracorporeal circuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. Thedialysis circuit consists of plastic blood tubing, a two-compartment filter known as a dialyzer, or artificial kid-ney, and a dialysis machine that monitors and maintainsblood flow and administers dialysate, a chemical bathused to draw waste products out of the blood. Thepatient’s blood leaves and enters the body through twoneedles inserted into the patient’s vein, called an accesssite, and is pushed through the blood compartment of thedialyzer. Once inside of the dialyzer, excess fluids andtoxins are pulled out of the bloodstream and into thedialysate compartment, where they are carried out of thebody. At the same time, electrolytes and other chemicalsin the dialysate solution move from the dialysate into thebloodstream. The purified, chemically-balanced blood isthen returned to the body.\nPeritoneal dialysis\nIn peritoneal dialysis (PD), the patient’s peritoneum,\nor lining of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheteris surgically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. Duringtreatment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavitywith dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids movefrom the patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solu-tion. After a waiting period of six to 24 hours, dependingon the treatment method used, the waste-filled dialysateis drained from the abdomen, and replaced with cleandialysate. There are three types of peritoneal dialysis,which vary by treatment time and administrationmethod: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 807Chronic kidney failureGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 807(CAPD), Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD),\nand Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis (IPD).\nKidney transplantation\nKidney transplantation involves surgically attaching\na functioning kidney, or graft, from a brain dead organdonor (a cadaver transplant), or from a living donor, to apatient with ESRD. Patients with chronic renal diseasewho need a transplant and don’t have a living donor reg-ister with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing),the federal organ procurement agency, to be placed on awaiting list for a cadaver kidney transplant. Kidney avail-ability is based on the patient’s health status. When thenew kidney is transplanted, the patient’s existing, dis-eased kidneys may or may not be removed, depending onthe circumstances surrounding the kidney failure. A regi-men of immunosuppressive, or anti-rejection medication,is required after transplantation surgery.\nDietary management\nA diet low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorous,\nthree substances that the kidneys regulate, is critical inmanaging kidney disease. Other dietary restrictions, suchas a reduction in protein, may be prescribed dependingon the cause of kidney failure and the type of dialysistreatment employed. Patients with chronic kidney failurealso need to limit their fluid intake.\nMedications and dietary supplements\nKidney failure patients with hypertension typically\ntake medication to control their high blood pressure.Epoetin alfa, or EPO (Epogen), a hormone therapy, andintravenous or oral iron supplements are used to manageanemia. A multivitamin may be prescribed to replace vit-\namins lost during dialysis treatments. Vitamin D, which\npromotes the absorption of calcium, along with calciumsupplements, may also be prescribed.\nSince 1973, Medicare has picked up 80% of ESRD\ntreatment costs, including the costs of dialysis and trans-plantation and of some medications. To qualify for bene-fits, a patient must be insured or eligible for benefitsunder Social Security, or be a spouse or child of an eligi-ble American. Private insurance and state Medicaid pro-grams often cover the remaining 20% of treatment costs.\nPrognosis\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of kidney failure is criti-\ncal to improving length and quality of life in chronic kidneyfailure patients. Patient outcome varies by the cause ofchronic kidney failure and the method chosen to treat it.Overall, patients with chronic kidney disease leading toESRD have a shortened lifespan. According to the United\nStates Renal Data System (USRDS), the lifespan of anESRD patient is 18–47% of the lifespan of the age-sex-racematched general population. ESRD patients on dialysishave a lifespan that is 16–37% of the general population.\nThe demand for kidneys to transplant continues to\nexceed supply. In 1996, over 34,000 Americans were onthe UNOS waiting list for a kidney transplant, but only11,330 living donor and cadaver transplants were actual-ly performed. Cadaver kidney transplants have a 50%chance of functioning nine years, and living donor kid-neys that have two matching antigen pairs have a 50%chance of functioning for 24 years. However, some trans-plant grafts have functioned for over 30 years.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBock, G. H., E. J. Ruley, and M. P. Moore. A Parent’s Guide to\nKidney Disorders.

COPD commonly refers to two related, progres-sive diseases of the respiratory system, chronic bronchi-\ntisand emphysema . Because smoking is the major\ncause of both diseases, chronic bronchitis and emphyse-ma often occur together in the same patient.\nDescription\nCOPD is one of the fastest-growing health prob-\nlems. Nearly 16 million people in the United States, 14million with chronic bronchitis and two million withemphysema, suffer from COPD. COPD is responsiblefor more than 96,000 deaths annually, making it thefourth leading cause of death . Although COPD is more\ncommon in men than women, the increase in incidenceof smoking among women since World War II has pro-duced an increase in deaths from COPD in women.COPD has a large economic impact on the healthcaresystem and a destructive impact on the lives of patientsand their families. Quality of life for a person withCOPD decreases as the disease progresses.\nChronic bronchitis\nIn chronic bronchitis, chronic inflammation caused\nby cigarette smoking results in a narrowing of the open-ings in the bronchi, the large air tubes of the respiratorysystem, and interferes with the flow of air. Inflammationalso causes the glands that line the bronchi to produceexcessive amounts of mucus, further narrowing the air-ways and blocking airflow. The result is often a chroniccough that produces sputum (mainly mucus) and short-\nness of breath . Cigarette smoke also damages the cilia,\nsmall hair-like projections that move bacteria and foreignparticles out of the lungs, increasing the risk of infections.\nEmphysema\nEmphysema is a disease in which cigarette smoke\ncauses an overproduction of the enzyme elastase, one ofthe immune system’s infection-fighting biochemicals.This results in irreversible destruction of a protein in thelung called elastin which is important for maintaining thestructure of the walls of the alveoli, the terminal small airsacs of the respiratory system. As the walls of the alveolirupture, the number of alveoli is reduced and many ofthose remaining are enlarged, making the lungs of thepatient with emphysema less elastic and overinflated.Due to the higher pressure inside the chest that must bedeveloped to force air out of the less-elastic lungs, thebronchioles, small air tubes of the respiratory system,tend to collapse during exhalation. Stale air gets trappedin the air sacs and fresh air cannot be brought in.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are several important risk factors for COPD:\n• Lifestyle. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important\nrisk factor for COPD (80% of all cases). Cigar and pipesmoking can also cause COPD. Air pollution and indus-trial dusts and fumes are other important risk factors.\n• Age. Chronic bronchitis is more common in people\nover 40 years old; emphysema occurs more often inpeople 65 years of age and older.\n• Socioeconomic class. COPD-related deaths are about\ntwice as high among unskilled and semi-skilled labor-ers as among professionals.\n• Family clustering. It is thought that heredity predispos-\nes people in certain families to the development ofCOPD when other causes, such as smoking and air pol-lution, are present.\n• Lung infections. Lung infections make all forms of\nCOPD worse.\nIn the general population, emphysema usually devel-\nops in older individuals with a long smoking history. How-ever, there is also a form of emphysema that runs in fami-lies. People with this type of emphysema have a hereditarydeficiency of a blood component, an enzyme inhibitorcalled alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). This type of emphysemais sometimes called “early onset emphysema” because itcan appear when a person is as young as 30 or 40 yearsold. It is estimated that there are between 75,000 and150,000 Americans who were born with AAT-deficiency.Of this group, emphysema afflicts an estimated 20,000-40,000 people (1–3% of all cases of emphysema). The riskof developing emphysema for an AAT-deficient individualwho also smokes is much greater than for others.\nThe first symptoms of chronic bronchitis are cough\nand mucus production. These symptoms resemble a chestcold that lingers on for weeks. Later, shortness of breathdevelops. Cough, sputum production, and shortness ofbreath may become worse if a person develops a lunginfection. A person with chronic bronchitis may later\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 809Chronic obstructive lung diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 809develop emphysema as well. In emphysema, shortness of\nbreath on exertion is the predominant early symptom.Coughing is usually minor and there is little sputum. Asthe disease progresses, the shortness of breath occurswith less exertion, and eventually may be present evenwhen at rest. At this point, a sputum-producing coughmay also occur. Either chronic bronchitis or emphysemamay lead to respiratory failure—a condition in whichthere occurs a dangerously low level of oxygen or a seri-ous excess of carbon dioxide in the blood.\nDiagnosis\nThe first step in diagnosing COPD is a good medical\nevaluation, including a medical history and a physical\nexamination of the chest using a stethoscope. In addition,\nthe doctor may request one or more of the following tests:\nPulmonary function test\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air\ntaken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will deter-mine two important values: (1) vital capacity (VC), the largestamount of air expelled after the deepest inhalation, and (2)forced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum amount ofair expired in one second. The pulmonary function test can\nbe performed in the doctor’s office, but is expensive.\nChest x ray\nChest x rays can detect only about half of the cases of\nemphysema. Chest x rays are rarely useful for diagnosingchronic bronchitis.Blood gas levels\nBlood may be drawn from an artery (more painful\nthan drawing blood from a vein) to determine the amountof oxygen and carbon dioxide present. Low oxygen andhigh carbon dioxide levels are often indicative of chronicbronchitis, but not always of emphysema.\nTests for cause of infection\nIf infection is present, blood and sputum tests may\nbe done to determine the cause of infection.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nMany patients with lung disease also develop heart\nproblems. The ECG identifies signs of heart disease.\nTreatment\nThe precise nature of the patient’s condition will\ndetermine the type of treatment prescribed for COPD.With a program of complete respiratory care, disabilitycan be minimized, acute episodes prevented, hospitaliza-tions reduced, and some early deaths avoided. On theother hand, no treatment has been shown to slow theprogress of the disease, and only oxygen therapy increas-es survival rate.\nDrugs\nMedications frequently prescribed for COPD\npatients include:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 810Chronic obstructive lung diseaseA\nB\nC\nD\nA. lung cancer. B. pneumonia. C. emphysema. D. phlegm from chronic bronchitis. (Illustration by Argosy, Inc.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 810•Bronchodilators . These agents open narrowed airways\nand offer significant symptomatic relief for many, butnot all, people with COPD. There are three types ofbronchodilators: Beta2 agonists, anticholinergic agents,and theophylline and its derivatives. Depending on thespecific drug, a bronchodilator may be inhaled, inject-ed, or taken orally.\n•Corticosteroids . Corticosteroids, usually inhaled,\nblock inflammation and are most useful for patientswith chronic bronchitis with or without emphysema.Steroids are generally not useful in patients who haveemphysema.\n• Oxygen replacement. Eventually, patients with low\nblood oxygen levels may need to rely on supplementaloxygen from portable or stationary tanks.\n•Antibiotics . Antibiotics are frequently given at the first\nsign of a respiratory infection, such as increased spu-tum production or a change in color of sputum fromclear to yellow or green.\n• Vaccines. To prevent pulmonary infection from viruses\nand bacteria, people with COPD should be vaccinatedagainst influenza each year at least six weeks before\nflu season and have a one-time pneumococcal ( pneu-\nmonia ) vaccine.\n• Expectorants. These agents help loosen and expel\nmucus secretions from the airways.\n• Diuretics. These drugs are given to prevent excess\nwater retention in patients with associated right heart\nfailure .\n• Augmentation therapy (for emphysema due to AAT-\ndeficiency only). Replacement AAT (Prolastin), derivedfrom human blood which has been screened for viruses,is injected weekly or bimonthly for life.\nSurgery\nSurgical procedures for emphysema are very rare.\nThey are expensive and often not covered by insurance.The great majority of patients cannot be helped bysurgery, and no single procedure is ideal for those whocan be helped. In January of 1996, the government tem-porarily suspended Medicare payments for lung reduc-tion surgery.\n•Lung transplantation . Lung transplantation has been\nsuccessfully employed in some patients with end-stageCOPD. In the hands of an experienced team, the one-year survival rate is over 70%.\n• Lung volume reduction. These procedures remove\n20–30% of severely diseased lung tissue; the remainingparts of the lung are joined together.

Survival of patients with COPD is clearlyrelated to the degree of their lung function when they are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 811Chronic obstructive lung diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 811diagnosed and the rate at which they lose this function.\nOverall, the median survival is about 10 years forpatients with COPD who have lost approximately two-thirds of their lung function at diagnosis.\nPrevention\nLifestyle modifications that can help prevent COPD,\nor improve function in COPD patients, include: quittingsmoking, avoiding respiratory irritants and infections,avoiding allergens, maintaining good nutrition , drinking\nlots of fluids, avoiding excessively low or high tempera-tures and very high altitudes, maintaining proper weight,and exercising to increase muscle tone.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Burton Goldberg Group.

    "title": "Circumcision",
    "content": "Circumcision\nDefinition\nThe surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis or\nprepuce.\nPurpose\nIn the United States, circumcision in infant boys is\nperformed for social, medical, or cultural/religious rea-sons. Once a routine operation urged by pediatriciansand obstetricians for newborns in the middle of the twen-tieth century, circumcision has become an elective optionthat parents make for their sons on an individual basis.Families who practice Judaism or Islam may select tohave their sons circumcised as a religious practice. Oth-ers choose circumcision for medical benefits.\nFemale circumcision (also known as female genital\nmutilation ) is usually performed for cultural and social\nreasons by family members and others who are not mem-bers of the medical profession, with no anesthesia. Notonly is the prepuce removed but often the vaginal open-ing is sewn to make it smaller. This practice is supposedto ensure the virginity of a bride on her wedding day. Italso prevents the woman from achieving sexual pleasureduring coitus. This practice is not universally approvedby the medical profession and is considered by some as ahuman rights violation.\nThough the incidence of male circumcision has\ndecreased from 90% in 1979 to 60% in 1996, it is still themost common surgical operation in the United States.Circumcision rates are much lower for the rest of theindustrialized world. In Britain, it is only done for reli-gious practices or to correct a specific medical conditionof the penis.\nSome of the medical reasons parents choose cir-\ncumcision are to protect against infections of the uri-nary tract and the foreskin, prevent cancer , lower the\nrisk of getting sexually transmitted diseases , and pre-\nvent phimosis (a tightening of the foreskin that mayclose the opening of the penis). Though studies indi-cate that uncircumcised boys under the age of five are20 times more likely than circumcised boys to have\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 812CircumcisionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 812urinary tract infections (UTIs), the rate of incidence of\nUTIs is quite low. There are also indications that cir-cumcised men are less likely to suffer from penile can-\ncer, inflammation of the penis, or have many sexually\ntransmitted diseases. Here again, the rate of incidenceis low. Good hygiene usually prevents most infectionsof the penis. Phimosis and penile cancer are very rare,even in men who have not been circumcised. Educationand good safe sex practices can prevent sexually trans-mitted diseases in ways that a surgical procedure can-not because these are diseases acquired through riskybehaviors.\nWith these factors in mind, the American Academy\nof Pediatrics has issued a policy statement that statesthough there is existing scientific evidence that indicatesthe medical benefits of circumcision, the benefits aren’tKEY TERMS\nForeskin —A covering fold of skin over the tip of\nthe penis.\nGlans —The cone-shaped tip of the penis.\nHernia —Bulging of abdominal structures through\nan abnormal opening in the muscular wall.\nHydrocele —Collection of fluid in the scrotum.\nHypospadias —A congenital deformity of the penis\nwhere the urinary tract opening is not at the tip ofthe glans.\nPhimosis —A tightening of the foreskin that may\nclose the opening of the penis.\nPrepuce —A fold like the foreskin that covers the\nclitoris; another name for foreskin.\nstrong enough to recommended circumcision as a routine\npractice.\nPrecautions\nCircumcision should not be performed on infants\nwith certain deformities of the penis that may require aportion of the foreskin for repair. The most common con-dition for surgery using the foreskin is hypospadias, acongenital deformity of the penis where the urinary tractopening is not at the tip of the glans. Also, infants with alarge hydrocoele or hernia may suffer important compli-\ncations through circumcision. Premature infants andinfants with serious infections are also poor candidates tobe circumcised, as are infants with hemophilia , other\nbleeding disorders, or whose mothers had taken anticoag-ulant drugs. In older boys or men, circumcision is a minorprocedure. Therefore, it can be performed in virtuallyanyone without a serious illness or unusual deformity.\nDescription\nThe foreskin of the penis protects the sensitivity of\nthe glans and shields it from irritation by urine, feces,and foreign materials. It also protects the urinary openingagainst infection and incidental injury.\nIn circumcision of infants, the foreskin is pulled\ntightly into a specially designed clamp, and the foreskinpulls away from the broadened tip of the penis. Pressurefrom the clamp stops bleeding from blood vessels thatsupplied the foreskin. In older boys or adults, an incisionis made around the base of the foreskin, the foreskin is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 813Circumcision\nFigure A Figure B\nFigure C Figure D\nA typical circumcision procedure involves the following\nsteps: Figure A:The surgeon makes an incision around theforeskin.

Stitches are usually used to close the skin edges.\nPreparation\nDespite a long-standing belief that infants do not\nexperience serious pain from circumcision, most author-\nities now believe that some form of local anesthesia isnecessary. The physician injects local anesthesia at thebase of the penis or under the skin around the penis (sub-cutaneous ring block). Both anesthetics block keynerves. EMLA cream, a topical formula of several anes-thetics can also be used.\nAftercare\nAfter circumcision, the wound should be washed\ndaily. An antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly may beapplied to the site. If there is an incision, a wound dress-ing will be present and should be changed each time thediaper is changed. Sometimes a plastic ring is usedinstead of a bandage. The ring will usually fall off in fiveto eight days. The penis will heal in seven to 10 days.\nInfants who undergo circumcision may be fussy for\nsome hours afterward, so parents should be prepared forcrying, feeding problems, and sleep problems. Generallythese go away within a day. In older boys, the penis may bepainful, but this will go away gradually. A topical anesthet-ic ointment or spray may be used to relieve this temporarydiscomfort. There may also be a “bruise” on the penis,which typically goes away with no particular attention.\nRisks\nComplications following newborn circumcision\nappear in one out of every 500 procedures. Most compli-cations are minor. Bleeding occurs in half of the compli-cations and is usually easy to control. Infections are rare\nand present with fever and signs of inflammation.\nThere may be injuries to the penis itself, and these\nmay be difficult to repair. In 2000, there were reports thatthe surgical clamps used in circumcision were at fault inover 100 injuries reported between July 1996 and January2000. In nearly all cases, the clamps were assumed to bein working order but had been repaired with replacementparts that were not of the manufacturer’s specifications.Physicians were urged to inspect the clamps before useand ensure that their dimensions fit their infant patients.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGollaher, David L.

It is twice as commonin men as in women. The disease occurs in more thanhalf of all malnourished chronic alcoholics and killsabout 25,000 people a year. It is the third most commoncause of death in adults between the ages of 45 and 65.\nTypes of cirrhosis\nPortal or nutritional cirrhosis is the form of the dis-\nease most common in the United States. About 30–50%of all cases of cirrhosis are this type. Nine out of every 10people who have nutritional cirrhosis have a history ofalcoholism . Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is also called\nLaënnec’s cirrhosis.\nBiliary cirrhosis is caused by intrahepatic bile-duct\ndiseases that impede bile flow. Bile is formed in the liverand is carried by ducts to the intestines. Bile then helpsdigest fats in the intestines. Biliary cirrhosis can scar orblock these ducts. It represents 15–20% of all cirrhosis.\nVarious types of chronic hepatitis, especially hepati-\ntis B and hepatitis C , can cause postnecrotic cirrhosis.This form of the disease affects up to 40% of all patients\nwho have cirrhosis.\nDisorders like the inability to metabolize iron and\nsimilar disorders may cause pigment cirrhosis ( hemo-\nchromatosis ), which accounts for 5–10% of all instances\nof the disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nLong-term alcoholism is the primary cause of cir-\nrhosis in the United States. Men and women respond dif-ferently to alcohol. Although most men can safely con-sume two to five drinks a day, one or two drinks a daycan cause liver damage in women. Individual tolerance toalcohol varies, but people who drink more and drinkmore often have a higher risk of developing cirrhosis. Insome people, one drink a day can cause liver scarring.\nChronic liver infections like hepatitis B and particu-\nlarly hepatitis C are commonly linked to cirrhosis. Peo-ple at high risk of contracting hepatitis B include thoseexposed to the virus through contact with blood and bodyfluids. This includes healthcare workers and intraveneous\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 815Cirrhosis\nA micrograph of a human liver showing tissue damaged by cirrhosis. (Photograph by Professor P .

People in the past have contracted\nhepatitis C through blood transfusions.\nLiver injury, reactions to prescription medications,\nexposure to toxic substances, and repeated episodes ofheart failure with liver congestion can cause cirrhosis.\nThe disorder can also be a result of diseases that run infamilies (inherited diseases) like:\n• a lack of a specific liver enzyme (alpha\n1-antitrypsin\ndeficiency)\n• the absence of a milk-digesting enzyme (galactosemia)• an inability to convert sugars to energy (glycogen stor-\nage disease)\n• an absorption deficit in which excess iron is deposited in\nthe liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs (hemochro-matosis)\n• a disorder characterized by accumulations of copper in\nthe liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas (Wilson’s disease)\nPoor nutrition increases a person’s risk of develop-\ning cirrhosis. In about 10 out of every 100 patients, thecause of cirrhosis cannot be determined. Many peoplewho have cirrhosis do not have any symptoms (oftencalled compensated cirrhosis). Their disease is detectedduring a routine physical or when tests for an unrelatedmedical problem are performed. This type of cirrhosiscan also be detected when complications occur (decom-pensated cirrhosis).\nSymptoms of cirrhosis are usually caused by the loss\nof functioning liver cells or organ swelling due to scarring.The liver enlarges during the early stages of illness. Thepalms of the hands turn red and patients may experience:\n• constipation\n• diarrhea\n• dull abdominal pain\n• fatigue• indigestion• loss of appetite• nausea• vomiting• weakness• weight loss\nAs the disease progresses, the spleen enlarges and\nfluid collects in the abdomen ( ascites ) and legs ( edema ).\nSpider-like blood vessels appear on the chest and shoul-ders, and bruising becomes common. Men sometimeslose chest hair. Their breasts may grow and their testiclesmay shrink. Women may have menstrual irregularities.Cirrhosis can cause extremely dry skin and intense\nitching . The whites of the eyes and the skin may turn\nyellow ( jaundice ), and urine may be dark yellow or\nbrown. Stools may be black or bloody. Sometimes thepatient develops persistent high blood pressure due to thescarring (portal hypertension ). This type of hyperten-\nsion can be life threatening. It can cause veins to enlargein the stomach and in the tube leading from the mouth tothe stomach (esophagus). These enlarged veins are calledvarices, and they can rupture and bleed massively.\nOther symptoms of cirrhosis include:\n• anemia\n• bleeding gums\n• decreased interest in sex\n•f e v e r• fluid in the lungs\n• hallucinations\n• lethargy\n• lightheadedness\n• muscle weakness• musty breath\n• painful nerve inflammation (neuritis)\n• slurred speech\n• tremors\nIf the liver loses its ability to remove toxins from the\nbrain, the patient may have additional symptoms. Thepatient may become forgetful and unresponsive, neglectpersonal care, have trouble concentrating, and acquirenew sleeping habits. These symptoms are related toammonia intoxication and the failure of the liver to con-vert ammonia to urea. High protein intake in thesepatients can also lead to these symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nA patient’s medical history can reveal illnesses or\nlifestyles likely to lead to cirrhosis. Liver changes can beseen during a physical examination . A doctor who sus-\npects cirrhosis may order blood and urine tests to measureliver function. Because only a small number of healthycells are needed to carry out essential liver functions, testresults may be normal even when cirrhosis is present.\nComputed tomography scans (CT), ultrasound,\nand other imaging techniques can be used during diagno-sis. They can help determine the size of the liver, indicatehealthy and scarred areas of the organ, and detect gall-\nstones . Cirrhosis is sometimes diagnosed during surgery\nor by examining the liver with a laparoscope. This view-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 816CirrhosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 816ing device is inserted into the patient’s body through a\ntiny incision in the abdomen.\nLiver biopsy is usually needed to confirm a diagno-\nsis of cirrhosis. In this procedure, a tissue sample isremoved from the liver and is examined under a micro-scope in order to learn more about the organ.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to cure or reduce the condi-\ntion causing cirrhosis, prevent or delay disease progres-sion, and prevent or treat complications.\nSalt and fluid intake are often limited, and activity is\nencouraged. A diet high in calories and moderately high inprotein can benefit some patients. Tube feedings or vita-\nmin supplements may be prescribed if the liver continuesto deteriorate. Patients are asked not to consume alcohol.\nMedication\nIron supplements, diuretics , and antibiotics may be\nused for anemia, fluid retention, and ammonia accumula-tion associated with cirrhosis. Vasoconstrictors are some-times needed to stop internal bleeding and antiemeticsmay be prescribed to control nausea.\nLaxatives help the body absorb toxins and acceler-\nate their removal from the digestive tract. Beta blockers\nmay be prescribed to control cirrhosis-induced portalhypertension. Because the diseased liver can no longerefficiently neutralize harmful substances, medicationsmust be given with caution. Interferon medicines may beused by patients with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis Cto prevent post-hepatic cirrhosis.\nSurgery\nMedication that causes scarring can be injected\ndirectly into veins to control bleeding from varices in thestomach or esophagus. Varices may require a special sur-gical procedure called balloon tamponade ligation to stopthe bleeding. Surgery may be required to repair disease-related throat damage. It is sometimes necessary toremove diseased portions of the spleen and other organs.\nLiver transplants can benefit patients with advanced\ncirrhosis. However, the new liver will eventually becomediseased unless the underlying cause of cirrhosis isremoved. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis must demon-strate a willingness to stop drinking before being consid-ered suitable transplant candidates.\nSupportive measures\nA balanced diet promotes regeneration of healthy\nliver cells. Eating five or six small meals throughout theday should prevent the sick or bloated feeling patients\nwith cirrhosis often have after eating. Alcohol and caf-\nfeine , which destroy liver cells, should be avoided. So\nshould any foods that upset the stomach. Patients withbrain disease associated with cirrhosis should avoidexcessive amounts of protein in the diet.\nA patient can keep a food diary that describes what\nwas eaten, when it was eaten, and how the patient feltafterwards. This diary can be useful in identifying foodsthat are hard to digest and in scheduling meals to coin-cide with the times the patient is most hungry.\nPatients who have cirrhosis should weigh them-\nselves every day and notify their doctor of a sudden gainof five pounds or more. A doctor should also be notifiedif symptoms of cirrhosis appear in anyone who has notbeen diagnosed with the disease. A doctor should also benotified if a patient diagnosed with cirrhosis:\n• vomits blood\n• passes black stools• seems confused or unresponsive• shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, tenderness,\npain)\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments for cirrhosis are aimed at pro-\nmoting the function of healthy liver cells and relieving thesymptoms associated with the disease. Several herbalremedies may be helpful to cirrhosis patients. Dandelion(Taraxacum officinale ) and rock-poppy ( Chelidonium\nmajus ) may help improve the efficiency of liver cells.\nMilk thistle extract ( Silybum marianum ) may slow dis-\nease progression and significantly improve survival ratesin alcoholics and other cirrhosis patients. Practitioners ofhomeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine can also\nprescribe treatments that support healthy liver function.\nPrognosis\nCirrhosis-related liver damage cannot be reversed,\nbut further damage can be prevented by patients who:\n• eat properly• get enough rest• do not consume alcohol\n• remain free of infection\nIf the underlying cause of cirrhosis cannot be cor-\nrected or removed, scarring will continue. The liver willfail, and the patient will probably die within five years.Patients who stop drinking after being diagnosed withcirrhosis can increase their likelihood of living more thana few years from 40% to 60–70%.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 817CirrhosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 817Prevention\nEliminating alcohol abuse could prevent 75–80% of\nall cases of cirrhosis.\nOther preventive measures include:\n• obtaining counseling or other treatment for alcoholism\n• taking precautions (practicing safe sex, avoiding dirty\nneedles) to prevent hepatitis\n• getting immunizations against hepatitis if a person is in\na high-risk group\n• receiving appropriate medical treatment quickly when\ndiagnosed with hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n• having blood drawn at regular intervals to rid the body\nof excess iron from hemochromatosis\n• using medicines (chelating agents) to rid the body of\nexcess copper from Wilson’s disease\n• wearing protective clothing and following product\ndirections when using toxic chemicals at work, athome, or in the garden\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

    "title": "Cleft lip and palate",
    "content": "Cleft lip and palate\nDefinition\nA cleft is a birth defect that occurs when the tissues\nof the lip and/or palate of the fetus do not fuse very earlyin pregnancy . A cleft lip, sometimes referred to as a\nharelip, is an opening in the upper lip that can extend intothe base of the nostril. A cleft palate is an opening in theroof of the mouth.\nDescription\nBabies born with cleft lips will have an opening involv-\ning the upper lip. The length of the opening ranges from asmall notch, to a cleft that extends into the base of the nos-tril. Cleft lips may involve one or both sides of the lip.\nBabies born with cleft palates have openings in the\npalate, which is the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-tion of the opening varies. The cleft may be only in thehard palate, the bony portion of the roof of the mouth,opening into the floor of the nose. It may be only in thesoft palate, the soft portion of the roof of the mouth. Thecleft palate may involve both the hard and soft palate andmay occur on both sides of the center of the palate.\nBabies may have cleft lips with or without cleft\npalates. Cleft palates may also occur without cleft lips.\nThe incidence of cleft lip and palate not associated\nwith a syndrome is one in 700 newborns. Native Ameri-cans have an incidence of 3.6 in 1,000 newborns. The inci-dence among Japanese newborns is 2.1 in 1,000. The inci-dence among whites is one in 1,000 newborns. AfricanAmericans have an incidence of 0.3 in 1,000 newborns.\nCauses and symptoms\nCleft lips and palates not associated with a syn-\ndrome are caused by a combination of genetic and envi-ronmental factors. Inheritance caused by such a combi-nation is called multifactorial. The embryo inherits genesthat increase the risk for cleft lip and/or palate. When anembryo with such genes is exposed to certain environ-mental factors the embryo develops a cleft.\nThe risk of a baby being born with a cleft lip or\npalate increases with the number of affected relatives andincreases with relatives that have more severe clefts.\nEnvironmental factors that increase the risk of cleft\nlip and palate include cigarette and alcohol use during\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 818Cleft lip and palateGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 818pregnancy. Some drugs also increase the incidence of\nclefting, such as phenytoin, sodium valproate, andmethotrexate. The pregnant mother’s nutrition may\naffect the incidence of clefting as well.\nBabies born with a cleft lip will be seen to have an\nelongated opening in the upper lip. The size of this openingmay range from a small notch in the upper lip to an open-ing that extends into the base of the nostril. The cleft lipmay be below the right or left nostril or below both nostrils.\nBabies born with a cleft palate will be seen to have\nan opening into the roof of the mouth. The size and posi-tion of the cleft varies and it may involve only the hardpalate, or only the soft palate and may occur on bothsides of the center of the palate.\nIn some cases the cleft palate will be covered with\nthe normal lining of the mouth and can only be felt bythe examiner.\nBabies with cleft lips and palates have feeding diffi-\nculties, which are more severe in babies with cleftpalates. The difficulty in feeding is due to the baby beingunable to achieve complete suction. In the case of cleftsof the hard palate, liquids enter the nose from the mouththrough the opening in the hard palate.\nA cleft palate also affects a child’s speech, since the\npalate is necessary for speech formation. The child’sspeech pattern may still be affected despite surgical repair.\nEar infections are more common in babies born with\ncleft palates. The infections occur because the muscles ofthe palate do not open the Eustachian tubes which drainthe middle ear. This allows fluid to collect and increasesthe risk of infection and hearing loss .\nTeeth may also erupt misaligned.\nDiagnosis\nCleft lip and palate can be diagnosed before birth by\nultrasound. After birth, cleft lip and palate are diagnosedby physical exam.\nTreatment\nIf cleft lip and/or palate are diagnosed by ultrasound\nbefore birth, further testing may be required to diagnoseassociated abnormalities if present. Referral to a cleftteam is essential. A cleft team consists of specialists inthe management of babies with clefts and includes sur-geons as well as nurses and speech therapists. Membersof the team inform the parents of all aspects of manage-ment. Feeding methods are also discussed, since feedingis the first problem that must be dealt with. It may bepossible to breastfeed a baby born with only a cleft lip,but babies born with cleft palates usually have moreproblems with feeding and frequently require special\nbottles and teats. A palatal obturator is a device that fitsinto the roof of the mouth, thus blocking the cleft open-ing and allowing easier suckling.\nSurgery to repair cleft lips is sometimes performed\nafter orthodontic treatment to narrow the gap in the upperlip. The orthodontic treatment can involve acrylic splintswith or without screws or may involve the use of adhesivetape placed across the gap in the lip. The orthodontic treat-ment for cleft lip should be started within the first threeweeks of life and continue until the cleft lip is repaired.\nThe timing of surgical cleft lip repair depends on the\njudgment of the surgeon who will perform the operation.The procedure is usually performed between one andthree months of age. The goals of the operation are toclose the gap in the upper lip, place scars in the naturalskin curves and to repair muscle so that the lip appearsnormal during movement. The closure is done in thethree layers (skin, muscle, and mucosa) that line theinside of the lip. At the time of the procedure, if the noseis shaped abnormally due to the cleft lip, it is also cor-rected. Sometimes further surgery may be needed on thelip and/or nose to refine the result.\nThe goals of the surgeon repairing a cleft palate are\nnormal speech, normal facial growth, and hearing for theaffected infant. The repair of the cleft palate is usually per-formed between three and 18 months of age. The timingmay extend beyond this and varies with the type of cleftpalate and center where the procedure is being performed.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 819Cleft lip and palate\nThis infant has an unilateral cleft lip and palate.

Their Eustachian tubes do not effectivelydrain fluid from the middle ear so fluid accumulates andinfection sets in. This may lead to hearing loss. Thesechildren require drainage tubes to be inserted to preventfluid accumulation.\nBabies born with clefts usually require orthodontic\ntreatment between 13 and 18 years of age. They alsorequire speech therapy.\nPrognosis\nBabies born with cleft lip and palate have a good\nprognosis, and approximately 80% will develop normalspeech.

    "content": "Climacteric seeMenopauseClenched fist injury\nDefinition\nA clenched fist injury (CFI) is a bite wound on the\nhand, caused when a person’s closed fist strikes the teethof another person, usually in the course of a fight. CFIs aresometimes referred to as closed fist injuries or fight bites.\nDescription\nClenched fist injuries are most common over the\nmetacarpo phalangeal joint. Their appearance is deceptivebecause they do not bleed heavily and the underlying injuryis hidden by soft tissue when the patient opens his hand andstraightens the injured finger. CFIs can, however, have seri-ous consequences, including infection, cellulitis , inflam-\nmation of the bone or bone marrow ( osteomyelitis ), septic\narthritis, and inflammation of the sheaths covering the ten-dons of the hand (tenosynovitis). These may lead to perma-nent loss of function or amputation .\nMost CFIs result in tissue injury due to the force of\nimpact, ragged-edged tears in the skin resulting fromcontact with the teeth, and contamination of the woundby the bacteria in human saliva. As the patient opens hishand, the skin of the finger is pulled backward over thedeeper part of the wound, thus sealing bacteria within theinjured tissue. This sealing of the wound by normalmotions of the finger is the reason why clenched fistinjuries have the highest rate of infection of any humanbite. The rate of infection of clenched-fist injuries variesfrom 15–50%.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of CFIs include fighting and other forms\nof aggressive behavior, often combined with drug oralcohol consumption.\nThe symptoms of clenched fist injury include pain\nin the affected part of the hand and some stiffness of theinjured finger with limitation of movement. If the patienthas delayed getting medical treatment, there may be evi-dence of infection, including swelling, redness, and sup-puration (a discharge of pus). The skin around the woundwill be warm to the touch and fever may be present.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of clenched fist injuries is usually made\non the basis of the location of the injury and x-ray find-ings. The most common finding in CFI x rays is soft tis-sue swelling, but the x rays may also reveal air pockets indeep tissues or the joint spaces, fragments of teeth, frac-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 820Clenched fist injuryGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 820ture lines in the bones, or small loose bone chips. Diag-\nnosis is often complicated by the fact that the patient willbe reluctant to admit how the injury happened. The treat-ing physician must maintain a high level of suspicion andoften ask directly.\nTreatment\nTreatment of clenched fist injuries is complicated by\nseveral factors. One factor is the anatomical structure ofthe human hand, which contains many small closedspaces that make it easy for infection to spread and per-sist. Another is the number of disease-causing bacteriatransmitted by human bites; at least 42 different specieshave been identified. In addition, CFIs typically do notreceive immediate treatment because the patient is con-cerned about legal consequences. The longer the delay,the higher the chances of infection and permanent dam-age to the hand. Patients who wait longer than 24 hoursto seek treatment or have signs of infection or damage tothe tendon, joint capsule, or bones are usually referredimmediately to a doctor who specializes in hand surgery.\nThe first step in treatment of clenched fist injury is irri-\ngation, a procedure by which the wound is flushed with astream of water under high pressure or with an antisepticsolution. Incision and drainage of the wound (I&D) may berequired as well as debridement , the surgical removal of\ndead tissue and foreign objects from a wound. Careful\nexamination of the depth of the wound is essential to prop-er treatment. The surgeon may need to enlarge the sides ofthe wound in order to make an accurate evaluation. Thepatient will be asked to move the affected joint through itsfull range of motion so that the surgeon can determinewhether the tendon or joint capsule has been damaged. Fol-lowing these procedures, the surgeon will pack the woundand put the hand in a splint. Bite wounds are never sutured\n(sewn shut) because of the possibility of enclosing bacteriainside the injury. After 24 hours, the packing will beremoved and the hand reexamined for signs of infection.\nIf the wound has become infected, the patient is usu-\nally hospitalized and given parenteral (injectable) antibi-\notics . The wound is irrigated and examined to determine\nthe extent of the injury. Cultures are taken for both aerobic(requiring air or oxygen to live) and anaerobic (not requir-ing air or oxygen) species of bacteria. The cultures shouldbe taken from areas deep in the wound rather than fromthe surface for greater accuracy. Tetanus toxoid should be\ngiven if the patient has not been immunized within the last10 years. The patient should also receive treatment andfollow-up for the rare possibility of HIV and hepatitistransmission. Although no well-documented cases of HIVtransmission by human bites exist as of 2001, the potentialfor transmission by this route is still present.KEY TERMS\nAntibiotic —A chemical substance produced by a\nmicroorganism which can inhibit the growth of orkill other microorganisms.\nDebridement— Surgical removal of damaged tis-\nsue and foreign objects from a wound.\nI&D—Incision and drainage of a wound.\nIrrigation —Cleansing a wound with large amounts\nof water and/or an antiseptic solution.\nParenteral —Administered inside the body but out-\nside the digestive tract.\nTetanus toxoid —Tetanus toxoid is a vaccine used\nto prevent tetanus (also known as lockjaw).\nInfected clenched fist injuries usually contain sever-\nal disease-causing bacteria, the most common beingStreptococcus pyogenes ,Staphylococcus aureus ,Bac-\nteroides sp. ,Peptostreptococcus sp. , and Eikenella corro-\ndens . Broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually given.\nUninfected and relatively superficial CFIs may be treatedwith oral penicillin plus dicloxacillin or Augmentin. Forinfected CFIs, parenteral penicillin G is usually giventogether with nafcillin or cefuroxime. CFIs infected bydrug-resistant strains of S. aureus may require treatment\nwith vancomycin.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the patient’s underlying\nstate of health and compliance with treatment; depth ofthe wound; the involvement of the joint capsule or ten-don; and the length of time before the wound is treated.The more superficial the wound and the faster the treat-ment, the better the prognosis.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent clenched fist injuries is to\navoid fist fights, intoxication, and association with peo-ple who practice these forms of behavior. If involved in afistfight, people should avoid directing punches at theiropponent’s mouth. The next best preventive measure is toget medical treatment at once for a clenched-fist injury.\nResources\nBOOKS\nJacobs, Richard A., MD. “Animal & Human Bite Wounds.” In\n“General Problems in Infectious Diseases.” Current Med-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 821Clenched fist injuryGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 821ical Diagnosis & Treatment 2001 . 40th edition.

    "title": "Clubfoot",
    "content": "Clubfoot\nDefinition\nClubfoot is a condition in which one or both feet are\ntwisted into an abnormal position at birth. The conditionis also known as talipes.\nDescription\nTrue clubfoot is characterized by abnormal bone for-\nmation in the foot. There are four variations of clubfoot,including talipes varus, talipes valgus, talipes equines,and talipes calcaneus. In talipes varus, the most commonform of clubfoot, the foot generally turns inward so thatthe leg and foot look somewhat like the letter J. In talipesvalgus, the foot rotates outward like the letter L. In tal-ipes equinus, the foot points downward, similar to that ofa toe dancer. In talipes calcaneus, the foot points upward,with the heel pointing down.Clubfoot can affect one foot or both. Sometimes an\ninfant’s feet appear abnormal at birth because of theintrauterine position of the fetus birth. If there is noanatomic abnormality of the bone, this is not true club-foot, and the problem can usually be corrected by apply-ing special braces or casts to straighten the foot.\nThe ratio of males to females with clubfoot is 2.5 to\n1. The incidence of clubfoot varies only slightly. In theUnited States, the incidence is approximately 1 in every1,000 live births. A 1980 Danish study reported an over-all incidence of 1.20 in every 1,000 children; by 1994,that number had doubled to 2.41 in every 1,000 livebirths. No reason was offered for the increase.\nCauses and symptoms\nExperts do not agree on the precise cause of club-\nfoot. The exact genetic mechanism of inheritance hasbeen extensively investigated using family studies andother epidemiological methods. As of 1999, no definitiveconclusions had been reached, although a Mendelian pat-tern of inheritance is suspected. This may be due to theinteraction of several different inheritance patterns, dif-ferent patterns of development appearing as the samecondition, or a complex interaction between genetic andenvironmental factors. The MSX1 gene has been associ-ated with clubfoot in animal studies. But, as of 2001,these findings have not been replicated in humans.\nA family history of clubfoot has been reported in\n24.4% of families in a single study. These findings sug-gest the potential role of one or more genes being respon-sible for clubfoot.\nSeveral environmental causes have been proposed\nfor clubfoot. Obstetricians feel that intrauterine crowd-ing causes clubfoot. This theory is supported by a sig-nificantly higher incidence of clubfoot among twinscompared to singleton births. Intrauterine exposure tothe drug misoprostol has been linked with clubfoot.Misoprostol is commonly used when trying, usuallyunsuccessfully, to induce abortion in Brazil and inother countries in South and Central America.Researchers in Norway have reported that males whoare in the printing trades have significantly more off-spring with clubfoot than men in other occupations.For unknown reasons, amniocentesis , a prenatal test,\nhas also been associated with clubfoot. The infants ofmothers who smoke during pregnancy have a greater\nchance of being born with clubfoot than are offspringof women who do not smoke.\nTrue clubfoot is usually obvious at birth. The four\nmost common varieties have been described. A clubfoothas a typical appearance of pointing downward and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 822ClubfootGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 822being twisted inwards. Since the condition starts in the\nfirst trimester of pregnancy, the abnormality is quite wellestablished at birth, and the foot is often very rigid.Uncorrected clubfoot in an adult causes only part of thefoot, usually the outer edge, or the heel or the toes, totouch the ground. For a person with clubfoot, walkingbecomes difficult or impossible.\nDiagnosis\nTrue clubfoot is usually recognizable and obvious\non physical examination . A routine x ray of the foot that\nshows the bones to be malformed or misaligned suppliesa confirmed diagnosis of clubfoot. Ultrasonography isnot always useful in diagnosing the presence of clubfootprior to the birth of a child.\nTreatment\nMost orthopedic surgeons agree that the initial treat-\nment of congenital (present at birth) clubfoot should benon-operative. Non-surgical treatment should begin inthe first days of life to take advantage of the favorablefibro-elastic properties of the foot’s connective tissues,those forming the ligaments, joint capsules, and tendons.In a common treatment, a series of casts is applied over aperiod of months to reposition the foot into a normalalignment. In mild cases, splinting and wearing braces atnight may correct the abnormality.\nWhen clubfoot is severe enough to require surgery,\nthe condition is usually not completely correctable,although significant improvement is possible. In the mostsevere cases, surgery may be required, especially whenthe Achilles tendon, which joins the muscles in the calfto the bone of the heel, needs to be lengthened. Becausean early operation induces fibrosis, a scarring and stiff-ness of the tissue, surgery should be delayed until anaffected child is at least three months old.\nMuch of a clubfoot abnormality can be corrected by\nthe use of manipulation and casting during the first threemonths of life. Proper manipulative techniques must befollowed by applications of appropriately molded plastercasts to provide effective and safe correction of mostvarieties of clubfoot. Long-term care by an orthopedist isrequired after initial treatment to ensure that the correc-tion of the abnormality is maintained. Exercises, correc-tive shoes, or nighttime splints may be needed until thechild stops growing.\nPrognosis\nWith prompt, expert treatment, clubfoot is usually\ncorrectable. Most individuals are able to wear regularshoes and lead active lives. If clubfoot is not appropriate-\nly treated, the abnormality becomes fixed. This has aneffect on the growth of the leg and foot, and some degreeof permanent disability usually results.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHall, Judith G. “Chromosomal Clinical Abnormalilties.” In\nNelson Textbook of Pediatrics. 16th ed.

The pain\nlasts for one to two hours on average and may recur sev-eral times in a day.\nDescription\nCluster headaches have been known as histamine\nheadaches, red migraines, and Horton’s disease, amongothers. The constant factor is the pain, which transcendsby far the distress of the more common tension-typeheadache or even that of a migraine headache .\nCluster headaches afflict less than 0.5% of the popu-\nlation and predominantly affect men; approximately 80%of sufferers are male. Onset typically occurs in the late20s, but there is no absolute age restriction. Approximate-ly 80% of cluster headaches are classified as episodic; theremaining 20% are considered chronic. Both display thesame symptoms. However, episodic cluster headachesoccur during one- to five-month periods followed by six-to 24-month attack-free, or remission, periods. There isno such reprieve for chronic cluster headache sufferers.\nCauses and symptoms\nBiochemical, hormonal, and vascular changes\ninduce cluster headaches, but why these changes occurremains unclear. Episodic cluster headaches seem to belinked to changes in day length, possibly signaling a con-nection to the so-called biological clock. Alcohol, tobac-co, histamine, or stress can trigger cluster headaches.\nDecreased blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can also actas a trigger, particularly during the night when an indi-vidual is sleeping. Interestingly, the triggers do not causecluster headaches during remission periods.\nThe primary cluster headache symptom is excruciat-\ning one-sided head pain centered behind an eye or nearthe temple. This pain may radiate outward from the ini-tial focus and encompass the mouth and teeth. For thisreason, some cluster headache sufferers may mistakenlyattribute their pain to a dental problem. Secondary symp-toms, occurring on the same side as the pain, include eyetearing, nasal congestion followed by a runny nose, pupilcontraction, and facial drooping or flushing.\nDiagnosis\nCluster headache symptoms guide the diagnosis. A\nmedical examination includes recording headache\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 824Cluster headacheGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 824details, such as frequency and duration, when it occurs,\npain intensity and location, possible triggers, and anyprior symptoms. This history allows other potential prob-lems to be discounted.\nTreatment\nTreatment for cluster headaches is composed of\ninduction, maintenance, and symptomatic therapies. Thefirst two therapies are prophylactic treatments, gearedtoward preventing headaches. Symptomatic therapy ismeant to stop or shorten a headache.\nInduction and maintenance therapies begin together.\nInduction therapy is intended to break the headache cyclewith drugs such as corticosteroids (for example, pred-\nnisone) or dihydroergotamine. These drugs are not meantfor long-term therapy, but rather as a jump-start for main-tenance therapy. Maintenance therapy drugs include ver-apamil, lithium carbonate, ergotamine, and methy-sergide. These drugs have long-term effectiveness, butmust be taken for at least a week before a response isobserved. With long-term treatment, methysergide mustbe stopped for one month each year to avoid dangerousside effects (formation of fibrous tissue inside theabdominal artery, lungs, and heart valves).\nDespite prophylactic treatment, headaches may still\noccur. Symptomatic therapy includes oxygen inhalation,KEY TERMS\nBiological clock —A synonym for the body’s circa-\ndian rhythm, the natural biological variations thatoccur over the course of a day.\nMigraine headache —An intense throbbing pain\nthat occurs on one or both sides of the head.

Surgery is a last resort for chroniccluster headaches that fail to respond to therapy.\nAlternative treatment\nSince some cluster headaches are triggered by stress,\nstress reduction techniques, such as yoga ,meditation ,\nand regular exercise , may be effective. Some cluster\nheadaches may be an allergic response triggered by food orenvironmental substances, therefore identifying andremoving the allergen(s) may be key to resolution of theproblem. Histamine is another suspected trigger of clusterheadaches, and this response may be controlled with vita-min C and the bioflavonoids quercetin and bromelain(pineapple enzyme). Supplementation with essential fattyacids (EFA) will help decrease any inflammatory response.\nPhysical medicine therapies such as adjustments of\nthe spine, craniosacral treatment, and massage at thetemporomandibular joint (TMJ) can clear blockages, ascan traditional Chinese medical therapies includingacupuncture . Homeopathic treatment can also be bene-\nficial. Nervous system relaxant herbs, used singly or incombination, can allow the central nervous system torelax as well as assist in peripheral nerve response. A fewherbs to consider for relaxation are valerian ( Valeriana\nofficinalis ), chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ), rosemary\n(Rosemarinus officinalis ), and skullcap ( Scutellaria\nbaicalensis ).\nPrognosis\nIn general, drug therapy offers effective treatment.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 825Cluster headache\nCluster HeadacheAreas of pain\nNerves\nThe primary cluster headache symptom is excruciating one-\nsided head pain located behind an eye or near the temple.Secondary symptoms include eye tearing, nasal congestion,and a runny nose.

    "title": "Coagulation disorders",
    "content": "Coagulation disorders\nDefinition\nCoagulation disorders deal with disruption of the\nbody’s ability to control blood clotting. The most com-monly known coagulation disorder is hemophilia , a con-\ndition in which patients bleed for long periods of timebefore clotting. There are other coagulation disorderswith a variety of causes.\nDescription\nCoagulation, or clotting, occurs as a complex\nprocess involving several components of the blood. Plas-ma, the fluid component of the blood, carries a numberof proteins and coagulation factors that regulate bleed-ing. Platelets, small colorless fragments in the blood, ini-tiate contraction of damaged blood vessels so that lessblood is lost. They also help plug damaged blood vesselsand work with plasma to accelerate blood clotting. A dis-order affecting platelet production or one of the manysteps in the entire process can disrupt clotting.\nCoagulation disorders arise from different causes\nand produce different complications. Some commoncoagulation disorders are:\n• Hemophilia, or hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency),\nan inherited coagulation disorder, affects about 20,000Americans. This genetic disorder is carried by femalesbut most often affects males.\n• Christmas disease, also known as hemophilia B or Fac-\ntor IX deficiency, is less common than hemophilia Awith similar in symptoms.\n• Disseminated intravascular coagulation disorder, also\nknown as consumption coagulopathy, occurs as a resultof other diseases and conditions. This disease acceler-ates clotting, which can actually cause hemorrhage.\n•Thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of\ncoagulation disorder. It is characterized by a lack of cir-culating platelets in the blood. This disease alsoincludes idiopathic thrombocytopenia.\n• V on Willebrand’s disease is a hereditary disorder with\nprolonged bleeding time due to a clotting factor defi-\nciency and impaired platelet function. It is the mostcommon hereditary coagulation disorder.\n• Hypoprothrombinemia is a congenital deficiency of\nclotting factors that can lead to hemorrhage.\n• Other coagulation disorders include Factor XI deficien-\ncy, also known as hemophilia C, and Factor VII defi-ciency. Hemophilia C afflicts one in 100,000 peopleand is the second most common bleeding disorderamong women. Factor VII is also called serum pro-thrombin conversion accelerator (SPCA) deficiency.One in 500,000 people may be afflicted with this disor-der that is often diagnosed in newborns because ofbleeding into the brain as a result of traumatic delivery.\nCauses and symptoms\nSome coagulation disorders present symptoms such\nas severe bruising. Others will show no apparent symp-toms, but carry the threat of severe internal bleeding.\nHemophilia\nBecause of its hereditary nature, hemophilia A may\nbe suspected before symptoms occur. Some signs ofhemophilia A are numerous large, deep bruises and pain\nand swelling of joints caused by internal bleeding.Patients with hemophilia do not bleed faster, just longer.A person with mild hemophilia may first discover thedisorder with prolonged bleeding following a surgicalprocedure. If there is bleeding into the neck, head, or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 826Coagulation disordersGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 826digestive tract, or bleeding from an injury, emergency\nmeasures may be required.\nMild and severe hemophilia A are inherited through\na complex genetic system that passes a recessive gene onthe female chromosome. Women usually do not showsigns of hemophilia but are carriers of the disease. Eachmale child of the carrier has a 50% chance of havinghemophilia, and each female child has a 50% chance ofpassing the gene on.\nChristmas disease\nChristmas disease, or hemophilia B, is also heredi-\ntary but less common than hemophilia A. The severity ofChristmas disease varies from mild to severe, althoughmild cases are more common. The severity depends onthe degree of deficiency of the Factor IX (clotting factor).Hemophilia B symptoms are similar to those of hemo-philia A, including numerous, large, and deep bruisesand prolonged bleeding. The more dangerous symptomsare those that represent possible internal bleeding, suchas swelling of joints, or bleeding into internal organsupon trauma. Hemophilia most often occurs in familieswith a known history of the disease, but occasionally,new cases will occur in families with no apparent history.\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation\nThe name of this disorder arises from the fact that\nmalfunction of clotting factors cause platelets to clot insmall blood vessels throughout the body. This action leadsto a lack of clotting factors and platelets at a site of injurythat requires clotting. Patients with disseminated intravas-cular coagulation (DIC) will bleed abnormally eventhough there is no history of coagulation abnormality.Symptoms may include minute spots of hemorrhage onthe skin, and purple patches or hematomas caused bybleeding in the skin. A patient may bleed from surgery orintravenous injection (IV) sites. Related symptoms includevomiting, seizures, coma ,shortness of breath ,shock ,\nsevere pain in the back, muscles, abdomen, or chest.\nDIC is not a hereditary disorder or a common one. It\nis most commonly caused by complications during preg-\nnancy or delivery, overwhelming infections, acute\nleukemia, metastatic cancer , extensive burns and trauma,\nand even snakebites. There are a number of other causesof DIC, and it is not commonly understood why or howthese various disorders can lead to the coagulation prob-lem. What the underlying causes of DIC have in commonis some factor that affects proteins, platelets, or other clot-ting factors and processes. For example, uterine tissue canenter the mother’s circulation during prolonged labor,introducing foreign proteins into the blood, or the venomof some exotic snakes can activate one of the clotting fac-KEY TERMS\nClotting factor —Also known as coagulation fac-\ntors. Proteins in the plasma which serve to activatevarious parts of the blood clotting process bybeing transformed from inactive to active form.\nEnzyme —A substance that causes a chemical\nreaction, usually a protein. Enzymes are secretedby cells.\nHemorrhage —Abnormal bleeding from the blood\nvessels.\nHeparin —An anticoagulant, or blood clot “dis-\nsolver.”\nIdiopathic —Refers to a disease of unknown cause,\nand sometime to a primary disease.\nMetastatic —The term used to describe a sec-\nondary cancer, or one that has spread from onearea of the body to another.\nSerum reagents —Serum is fluid, or the fluid portion\nof the blood retained after removal of the bloodcells and fibrin clot. Reagents are substances addedto the serum to produce a chemical reaction.\nThrombosis —Formation of a clot in the blood that\neither blocks, or partially blocks a blood vessel.The thrombus may lead to infarction, or death oftissue, due to a blocked blood supply.\ntors. Severe head trauma can expose blood to brain tissue.\nNo matter the cause of DIC, the results are a malfunctionof thrombin (an enzyme) and prothrombin (a glycopro-tein), which activate the fibrinolytic system, releasingclotting factors in the blood. DIC can alternate from hem-orrhage to thrombosis, and both can exist, which furthercomplicates diagnosis and treatment.\nThrombocytopenia\nThrombocytopenia may be acquired or congenital. It\nrepresents a defective or decreased production ofplatelets. Symptoms include sudden onset of small spotsof hemorrhage on the skin, or bleeding into mucousmembranes (such as nosebleeds). The disorder may alsobe evident as blood in vomit or stools, bleeding duringsurgery, or heavy menstrual flow in women. Somepatients show none of these symptoms, but complain offatigue and general weakness. There are several causes\nof thrombocytopenia, which is more commonly acquiredas a result of another disorder. Common underlying dis-orders include leukemia, drug toxicity, or aplastic ane-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 827Coagulation disordersGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 827mia, all of which lead to decreased or defective produc-\ntion of platelets in the bone marrow. Other diseases maydestroy platelets outside the marrow. These includesevere infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation,and cirrhosis of the liver. The idiopathic form most com-\nmonly occurs in children, and is most likely the result ofproduction of antibodies that cause destruction ofplatelets in the spleen and to a lesser extent the liver.\nV on Willebrand’s disease is caused by a defect in the\nV on Willebrand clotting factor, often accompanied by adeficiency of Factor VIII as well. It is a hereditary disor-der that affects both males and females. In rare cases, itmay be acquired. Symptoms include easy bruising, bleed-ing in small cuts that stops and starts, abnormal bleedingafter surgery, and abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding.Nosebleeds and blood in the stool with a black, tarlikeappearance are also signs of V on Willebrand’s disease.\nHypoprothrombinemia\nThis disorder is a deficiency in prothrombin, or Factor\nII, a glycoprotein formed and stored in the liver. Prothrom-bin, under the right conditions, is converted to thrombin,which activates fibrin and begins the process of coagula-tion. Some patients may show no symptoms, and otherswill suffer severe hemorrhaging. Patients may experienceeasy bruising, profuse nosebleeds, postpartum hemorrhage,excessively prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, andpostsurgical hemorrhage. Hypoprothrombinemia may alsobe acquired rather than inherited, and usually results from aVitamin K deficiency caused by liver diseases, newborn\nhemorrhagic disease, or a number of other factors.\nOther coagulation disorders\nFactor XI deficiency, or hemophilia C, occurs more\nfrequently among certain ethnic groups, with an incidenceof about one in 10,000 among Ashkenazi Jews. Nearly50% of patients with this disorder experience no symp-toms, but others may notice blood in their urine, nose-bleeds, or bruising. Although joint bleeding seldom occurs,some factor XI patients will experience bleeding long afteran injury occurs. Some women will experience prolongedbleeding after childbirth . Patients with factor VII deficien-\ncy vary greatly in their bleeding severity. Women mayexperience heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding from thegums or nose, bleeding deep within the skin, and episodesof bleeding into the stomach, intestine, and urinary tract.Factor VII patients may also suffer bleeding into joints.\nDiagnosis\nSeveral blood tests can be used to detect various\ncoagulation disorders. There are hundreds of differenttests a doctor can order to look for indications of specificdiseases. In addition to blood tests, physicians will com-\nplete a medical history and physical examination . In the\ncase of acquired coagulation disorders, information suchas prior or current diseases and medications will beimportant in determining the cause of the blood disorder.\n• Hemohilia A will be diagnosed with laboratory tests\ndetecting presence of clotting factor VIII, factor IX, andothers, as well as the presence or absence of clottingfactor inhibitors.\n• Christmas disease will be checked against normal\nbleeding and clotting time, as well as for abnormalserum reagents in factor IX deficiency. Other tests ofprothrombin time and thromboplastic generation may\nalso be ordered.\n• There is no one test or group of tests that can always\nmake (or exclude) a diagnosis of DIC. DIC can be diag-nosed through a number of laboratory tests which mea-sure concentration of platelets and fibrinogen in theblood with normal counts and prolonged prothrombintime. Other supportive data include diminished levelsof factors V , fibrinogen, and VIII, decreased hemoglo-bin, and others. Since many of the test results also indi-cate other disorders, the physician may have to puttogether several results to reach a diagnosis of DIC.Serial tests may also be recommended, because a singleexamine at one moment in time may not reveal theprocess that is occurring.\n• Tests for thrombocytopenia include coagulation tests\nrevealing a decreased platelet count , prolonged bleed-\ning time, and other measurements. If these tests indi-cate that platelet destruction is causing the disorder, thephysician may order bone marrow examination.\n• V on Willebrand’s disease will be diagnosed with the\nassistance of laboratory tests which show prolongedbleeding time, absent or reduced levels of factor VIII,normal platelet count, and others.\n• Hypothrombinemia is diagnosed with history informa-\ntion and the use of tests that measure vitamin K defi-ciency, deficiency of prothrombin, and clotting factorsV , VII, IX, and X.\n• Factor XI deficiency is diagnosed most often after\ninjury-related bleeding. Blood tests can help pinpointfactor VII deficiency.\nTreatment\nIn mild cases, treatment may involve the use of\ndrugs that stimulate the release of deficient clotting fac-tors. In severe cases, bleeding may only stop if the clot-ting factor that is missing is replaced through infusion ofdonated human blood in the form of fresh frozen plasmaor cryoprecipitate.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 828Coagulation disordersGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 828• Hemophilia A in mild episodes may require infusion of\na drug called desmopressin or DDA VP. Severe bleedingepisodes will require transfusions of human blood clot-ting factors. Hemophiliacs are encouraged to receivephysical therapy to help damaged joints and to exercise\nin non-contact sports such as swimming, bicycle riding,or walking.\n• Christmas disease patients are treated similarly to\nhemophilia A patients. There are commercial productsand human blood products available to provide coagu-lation. Cryoprecipitate was invented in 1965 to replacethe need for whole plasma transfusions, which intro-duced more volume than needed. By the 1970s, peoplewere able to infuse themselves with freeze-dried clot-ting factor. Superficial wounds can be cleaned and ban-\ndaged. Parents of hemophiliac children receivingimmunizations should inform the vaccination provider\nin advance to decrease the possibility of bleeding prob-lems. These children should probably not receive injec-tions which go into the muscle.\n• Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation\npatients is complicated by the large variety of underly-ing causes of the disorder. If at all possible, the physi-cian will first treat this underlying disorder. If thepatient is not already bleeding, this supportive treat-ment may eliminate the DIC. However, if bleeding isoccurring, the patient may need blood, platelets, freshfrozen plasma, or other blood products. Heparin hasbeen controversial in treating DIC, but it is often usedas a last resort to stop hemorrhage. Heparin has notproven useful in treating patients with DIC resultingfrom heat stroke , exotic snakebites, trauma, mis-\nmatched transfusions, and acute problems resultingfrom obstetrical complications.\n• Secondary acquired thrombocytopenia is best alleviated\nby treating the underlying cause or disorder. The specif-ic treatment may depend on the underlying cause.Sometimes, cortocoosterids or immune globulin maybe given to improve platelet production.\n• V on Willebrand’s disease is treated by several methods\nto reduce bleeding time and to replace factor VIII,which consequently will replace the V on Willebrandfactor. This may include infusion of cryoprecipitate orfresh frozen plasma. Desmopressin may also help raiselevels of the V on Willebrand factor.\n• Hypoprothrombinemia may be treated with concen-\ntrates of prothrombin. Vitamin K may also be produced,and in bleeding episodes, the patient may receive freshplasma products.\n• Factor XI (hemophilia C) is most often treated with\nplasma, since there are no commercially available con-centrates of factor XI in the United States. Factor VIIpatients may be treated with prothrombin complex con-\ncentrates. As of early 1998, factor VII concentrate wasnot licensed in the United States and could only be usedwith special permission.\nAlternative treatment\nThis can be a very severe condition and should be\nmanaged by a practitioner of alternative medicine in con-junction with a medical doctor; this condition should notbe self managed. For patients known to suffer from hemo-philia A or B and other bleeding disorders, avoidance ofactivities that can cause severe injury should be practiced.Comprehensive care addresses the whole person by help-ing to deal with the psychosocial aspects of the disease.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for patients with mild forms of coag-\nulation disorders is normally good. Many people canlead a normal life and maintain a normal life expectancy.Without treatment of bleeding episodes, severe muscleand joint pain, and eventually, damage, can occur. Anyincident that causes blood to collect in the head, neck, ordigestive system can be very serious and requires imme-diate attention. DIC can be severe enough to cause clotsto form and a stroke could occur. DIC is also seriousenough to cause gangrene in the fingers, nose, or geni-\ntals. The prognosis depends on early intervention andtreatment of the underlying condition. Hemorrhage froma coagulation disorder, particularly into the brain ordigestive track, can prove fatal. In the past, patients whoreceived regular transfusions of human blood productswere subject to increased risk of AIDS and other dis-\neases. However, efforts have been made since the early1990s to ensure the safety of the blood supply.\nPrevention\nPrevention of coagulation disorders varies. Acquired\ndisorders may only be prevented by preventing onset of theunderlying disorder (such as cirrhosis). Hereditary disor-ders can be predicted with prenatal testing and genetic\ncounseling . Prevention of severe bleeding episodes may be\naccomplished by refraining from activities that could causeinjury, such as contact sports. Open communication withhealthcare providers prior to procedures or tests that couldcause bleeding may prevent a severe bleeding incident.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBellenir, Karen.

    "title": "Coarctation of the aorta",
    "content": "Coarctation of the aorta\nDefinition\nA defect that develops in the fetus in which there is a\nnarrowing of the aortic arch, the main blood artery thatdelivers blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the restof the body. Coarctation of the aorta is diagnosed in bothnewborns and adults. Approximately 10% of newborns withcongenital heart disease have coarctation of the aorta.\nDescription\nBlood leaves the heart by way of the left ventricle\nand is distributed to the body by arteries. The aortic archis the first artery to carry blood as it leaves the heart.Other arteries to the head and arms branch off the aorticarch. A narrowing of the aorta at any spot produces resis-tance to the flow of blood. This causes high blood pres-sure before the narrowing and low pressure below the nar-rowing (downstream). Parts of the body supplied by arter-ies that branch off the aortic arch before the narrowinghave high blood pressure, while most of the lower bodydoesn’t receive enough blood supply. To compensate forthis, the heart works harder, and the blood pressure rises.\nApproximately half of all infants with coarctation of\nthe aorta are diagnosed within the first two months oflife. Frequently, there are other congenital cardiac com-plications present. Infants with Turner syndrome have a\n45% rate of also having coarctation. There is evidencethat some cases of coarctation may be inherited.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn newborns with congenital heart disease, coarcta-\ntion of the aorta develops while the baby is in the womb.Among the consequences of coarctation of the aorta isventricular hypertrophy, an enlarging of the left ventriclein response to the increased back pressure of the bloodand the demand for more blood by the body. Symptomsin infants include shortness of breath (dyspnea), diffi-\nculty in feeding, and poor weight gain. Older childrenusually don’t have symptoms, but may display fatigue ,\nshortness of breath, or a feeling of lameness in their legs.\nDiagnosis\nInfants usually have an abnormal “gallop” heart\nrhythm and may also have heart murmurs . Sometimes\nexcessive arterial pulses can be seen in the carotid andsuprasternal notch arteries, indicating increased pressurein these arteries, while the femoral pulse is weak or can’tbe detected. The systolic pressure is higher in the armsthan in the legs. Enlargement of the heart can be seen in xrays. Similar symptoms are seen in older children andadults. A 10 mm Hg (mercury) pressure differencebetween the upper and lower extremities is diagnostic forcoarctation of the aorta. For some patients, the systolicpressure difference is observed only during exercise .\nInfants frequently have an abnormal electrocardiogram(ECG) that indicates that the right or both ventricles areenlarged, while in older children the ECG may be normalor show that the left ventricle is enlarged. The coarctationmay be detected in echocardiographic examination.\nTreatment\nDrugs can be used to treat the hypertension and\nheart failure .

    "content": "Cocaine\nDefinition\nCocaine is a highly addictive central nervous system\nstimulant extracted from the leaves of the coca plant,Erythroxylon coca .\nDescription\nIn its most common form, cocaine is a whitish crys-\ntalline powder that produces feelings of euphoria wheningested.\nNow classified as a Schedule II drug, cocaine has\nlegitimate medical uses as well as a long history of recre-ational abuse. Administered by a licensed physician, thedrug can be used as a local anesthetic for certain eye andear problems and in some kinds of surgery.\nForms of the drug\nIn powder form, cocaine is known by such street\nnames as “coke,” “blow,” “C,” “flake,” “snow” andKEY TERMS\nDyspnea —Difficulty in breathing. Usually associ-\nated with heart or lung diseases.\nElectrocardiogram —A graph of the heart’s beating\nproduced by an instrument that detects the electri-cal signals made by the heart.“toot.” It is most commonly inhaled or “snorted.” It may\nalso be dissolved in water and injected.\nCrack is a smokable form of cocaine that produces\nan immediate and more intense high. It comes in off-white chunks or chips called “rocks.” Little crumbs ofcrack are sometimes called “kibbles & bits.”\nIn addition to their stand-alone use, both cocaine and\ncrack are often mixed with other substances. Cocainemay be mixed with methcathinone (a more recent drug ofabuse, known as “cat,” that is similar to methampheta-mine) to create a “wildcat.” A hollowed-out cigar filledwith a mixture of crack and marijuana is known as a“woolah.” And either cocaine or crack used in conjunc-tion with heroin is called a “speedball.” Cocaine usedtogether with alcohol represents the most common fataltwo-drug combination.\nHistory\nCocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive\ndrugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used bythe Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region ofSouth America for thousands of years, both as a stimu-lant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia ( altitude\nsickness ).\nDespite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not\nuntil the latter part of the nineteenth century that theactive ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride, wasfirst extracted from those leaves. The new drug soonbecame a common ingredient in patent medicines andother popular products (including the original formulafor Coca-Cola). This widespread use quickly raised con-cerns about the drug’s negative effects. In the early1900s, several legislative steps were taken to addressthose concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the useof cocaine and other substances in non-prescription prod-ucts. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use declinedsubstantially.\nThe drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed\ninterest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the 1980s,use of the drug had once again become a national prob-lem. Cocaine use declined significantly during the early1990s, but it remains a significant problem and is on theincrease in certain geographic areas and among certainage groups.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs with other forms of addiction , cocaine abuse is\nthe result of a complex combination of internal andexternal factors. Genetic predisposition, family history,and immediate environment can all affect a person’sprobability of becoming addicted.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 831CocaineGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 831As many as three to four million people are estimat-\ned to be chronic cocaine users. The 1997 NationalHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse reported an estimated600,000 current crack users, showing no significantchange since the late 1980s.\nHow cocaine affects the brain\nExtensive research has been conducted to determine\nhow cocaine works on the brain and why it is so addictive.Cocaine has been found to affect an area of the brainknown as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which con-nects with the nucleus accumbens, a major pleasure cen-ter. Like other commonly abused addictive drugs,cocaine’s effects are related to the action of the neuro-transmitter dopamine, which carries information betweenneurons. Cocaine interferes with the normal functioningof neurons by blocking the re-uptake of dopamine, whichbuilds up in the synapses and is believed to cause thepleasurable feelings reported by cocaine users.\nShort-term effects of use\nThe short-term effects of cocaine can include:\n• rapid heartbeat\n• constricted blood vessels• dilated pupils\n• increased temperature\n• increased energy• reduced appetite\n• increased sense of alertness\n• euphoria•death due to overdose\nLong-term effects of use\nThe long-term effects of cocaine and crack use\ninclude:\n• dependence, addiction\n• irritability• mood swings\n• restlessness\n• weight loss• auditory hallucinations\n• paranoia\nCocaine use and pregnancy\nThe rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of\ncrack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about itseffects on the developing fetus and, since then, several\nresearch reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine usecould be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn,and child development problems. According to the TheLindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, many ofthese early reports had methodological flaws, and mostresearchers nowadays propose more cautious conclu-sions concerning prenatal cocaine effects. Much evi-dence would seem to point to the lack of quality prenatalcare and the use of alcohol and tobacco as primary fac-tors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaineusers. Research sponsored by the National Institute onDrug Abuse (NIDA) and the Albert Einstein MedicalCenter in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Cen-ter findings in reporting that the lack of quality prenatalcare is associated with undesirable effects often attrib-uted to cocaine exposure such as prematurity , low birth\nweight, and fetal or infant death. The Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) however, reports thatmothers who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five\ntimes as likely to have a baby with a malformation of theurinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug. Thus,cocaine use during pregnancy is assuredly most inadvis-able, especially since it is also often associated with theuse of alcohol known to cause long-term developmentalproblems. Supporting the cocaine-exposed expectingmother so as to discourage cocaine use remains animportant task for all health caregivers.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult.\nMany of the signs of short-term cocaine use are notobvious. Since cocaine users often also use other drugs,it may not be easy to distinguish the effects of one drugfrom another.\nCocaine use has been documented in significant\nnumbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over allage groups, more men than women use the drug. Thehighest rate of cocaine use is found among adults 18 to25 years old.\nMedical complications\nCocaine has been linked to several serious health\nproblems, including:\n• arrhythmia\n• heart attacks\n• chest pain• respiratory failure\n• strokes\n• seizures\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 832CocaineGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 832Other complications may vary depending on how\nthe drug is administered. Prolonged snorting, for exam-ple, can irritate the nasal septum, producing nosebleeds,chronic runny nose, and other problems. Intravenoususers face an increased risk of infectious diseases such asHIV/AIDS and hepatitis.\nTesting\nDrug testing can be useful in diagnosing and treating\ncocaine abuse. Urine testing can detect cocaine; besidesproviding an objective alternative to reliance on what apatient says, such tests can also be used as a follow-up totreatment to confirm that the patient has remained drug-free.\nTreatment\nThe last two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the\nnumber of cocaine addicts seeking treatment. But like allforms of drug abuse, cocaine abuse/addiction is a multi-faceted phenomenon involving environmental, social,and familial as well as physiological factors. This greatlycomplicates the challenge of effectively treating cocaineaddiction.\nPharmacological treatments\nTo date, no medications have been approved specifi-\ncally for treating cocaine addiction. But several wereunder development at this writing. Selegeline, deliveredeither via a time-release pill or a transdermal patch,shows promise as a possible anti-cocaine medication.Clinical studies have shown the drug disulfiram (alsoused to treat alcoholics) to be effective in treatingcocaine abusers. In addition, antidepressant medicationsare sometimes used to control the mood swings associat-ed with the early stages of cocaine withdrawal.\nBehavioral approaches\nA wide range of behavioral interventions have been\nsuccessfully used to treat cocaine addiction. Theapproach used must be tailored to the specific needs ofeach individual patient, however.\nContingency management rewards drug abstinence\n(confirmed by urine testing) with points or voucherswhich patients can exchange for such things as anevening out or membership in a gym. Cognitive-behav-\nioral therapy helps users learn to recognize and avoid\nsituations most likely to lead to cocaine use and to devel-op healthier ways to cope with stressful situations. Resi-dential programs/therapeutic communities may also behelpful, particularly in more severe cases. Patients typi-cally spend six to 12 months in such programs, whichmay also include vocational training and other features.KEY TERMS\nApoxia —Apoxia refers to altitude sickness.\nArrhythmia —Irregular heartbeat.\nCentral nervous system —Part of the nervous sys-\ntem consisting of the brain, cranial nerves andspinal cord. The brain is the center of higherprocesses, such as thought and emotion and isresponsible for the coordination and control ofbodily activities and the interpretation of informa-tion from the senses.

In Japan,the herb acorus has been traditionally used both to assistearly-stage cocaine withdrawal and in later recoverystages. Other herbs sometimes used to treat drug addic-tions of various kinds include kola nut, guarana seed andyohimbe (to boost short-term energy), and valerian root,hops leaf, scullcap leaf, and chamomile (to calm thepatient). The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosinehave been used to reduce cocaine addicts’ craving for thedrug, and vitamin therapy may be used to help strengthenthe patient. Gentle massage has been used to help infantsborn with congenital cocaine addiction. Other tech-niques, such as acupuncture , EEG biofeedback , and\nvisualization, may also be useful in treating addiction.\nPrognosis\nBecause addiction involves so many different factors,\nprospects for individual addicts vary widely. However,research has consistently shown that treatment can signifi-cantly reduce both drug abuse and subsequent criminalactivity. The comprehensive Services Research OutcomesStudy (1998) found a 45% drop in cocaine use five yearsafter treatment, compared to use during the five years beforetreatment. The study also found that females generallyrespond better to treatment than males, and older patientstend to reduce their drug use more than younger patients.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 833CocaineGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 833Some research also supports the idea that 12-step\nprograms used in conjunction with other approaches cansignificantly enhance the prospects for a positive out-come. One study of people in outpatient drug-treatmentprograms found that participation in a 12-step programnearly doubled their chances of remaining drug-free.\nPrevention\nDespite significant variation over time, cocaine\naddiction has proven to be a persistent public health prob-lem. Interdiction and source control are expensive andhave failed to eliminate the problem, and some lawenforcement officials are now recommending moreemphasis on demand reduction through education andother measures to address the causes of cocaine addiction.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGold, Mark S.

    "title": "Coccidioidomycosis",
    "content": "Coccidioidomycosis\nDefinition\nCoccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhal-\ning the microscopic spores of the fungus Coccidioides\nimmitis . Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures that\nfungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists inthree forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms.The chronic form can develop as many as 20 years afterinitial infection and, in the lungs, can produce inflamed,injured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses). Dissemi-nated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of coccid-ioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body affectingmany organ systems and is often fatal.\nDescription\nCoccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The\nfungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desertsoil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Cen-tral and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is some-times called San Joaquin fever , valley fever, or desert\nfever because of its prevalence in the farming valleys ofCalifornia. Although commonly acquired, overt coccid-ioidomycosis is a rare disease. Chronic infections occurin only one out of every 100,000 people.\nAlthough anyone can get coccidioidomycosis, farm\nlaborers, construction workers, and archaeologists whowork where it is dusty are at greater risk to becomeinfected. People of any age can get coccidioidomycosis,but the disease most commonly occurs in the 25–55 agegroup. In its acute form, coccidioidomycosis infects menand women equally.\nChronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomy-\ncosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant women.Although it is not clear why, people of color are 10-20times more likely to develop the disseminated form ofthe disease than caucasians. People who have a weak-ened immune system (immunocompromised), eitherfrom diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result\nof medications that suppressed the immune system ( cor-\nticosteroids ,chemotherapy ), are more likely to develop\ndisseminated coccidioidomycosis.\nCauses and symptoms\nWhen the spores of C. immitis are inhaled, they can\nbecome lodged in the lungs, divide, and cause localizedinflammation. This is known as acute or primary coccid-ioidomycosis. The disease is not spread from one personto another. Approximately 60% of people who are infect-ed exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). In the other40%, symptoms appear 10–30 days after exposure.These symptoms include a fever which can reach 104°F(39.5°C), dry cough , chest pains, joint and muscle aches,\nheadache , and weight loss. About two weeks after the\nstart of the fever, some people develop a painful red rashor lumps on the lower legs. Symptoms usually disappearwithout treatment in about one month. People who havebeen infected gain partial immunity to reinfection.\nThe chronic form of coccidioidomycosis normally\noccurs after a long latent period of 20 or more years dur-ing which the patient experiences no symptoms of thedisease. In the chronic phase, coccidioidomycosis causes\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 834CoccidioidomycosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 834lung abscesses that rupture, spilling pus and fluid into the\nlungs, and causing serious damage to the lungs. Thepatient experiences difficulty breathing and has a fever,chest pain , and other signs of pneumonia . Medical treat-\nment is essential for recovery.\nIn its disseminated form, coccidioidomycosis\nspreads to other parts of the body including the liver,bones, skin, brain, heart, and lining around the heart(pericardium). Symptoms include fever, joint pain, lossof appetite, weight loss, night sweats, skin lesions , and\ndifficulty breathing. Also, in 30–50% of patients withdisseminated coccidioidomycosis, the tissue coverings ofthe brain and spinal cord become inflamed ( meningitis ).\nDiagnosis\nMany cases of coccidioidomycosis go undiagnosed\nbecause the symptoms resemble those of common viraldiseases. However, a skin test similar to that for tubercu-\nlosis will determine whether a person has been infected.\nThe test is simple and accurate, but it does not indicatewhether the disease was limited to its acute form or if ithas progressed to its chronic form.\nDiagnosis of chronic or disseminated coccidioidomy-\ncosis is made by culturing a sample of sputum or otherbody fluids in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. A bloodserum test is used to detect the presence of an antibody pro-duced in response to C. immitis infection. Chest x rays are\noften used to assess lung damage, but alone cannot lead toa definitive diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis because otherdiseases can produce similar results on the x ray.\nTreatment\nIn most cases of acute coccidioidomycosis, the\nbody’s own immune system is adequate to bring aboutrecovery without medical intervention. Fever and paincan be treated with non-prescription drugs.\nChronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis, how-\never, are serious diseases that require treatment with pre-scription drugs. Patients with intact immune systems whodevelop chronic coccidiodomycosis are treated with thedrug ketoconazole (Nizoral) or amphotericin B (Fungi-zone). Patients with suppressed immune systems are treat-ed with amphotericin B (Fungizone). Amphotericin B is apowerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic sideeffects. As a result, hospitalization is required in order tomonitor patients. The patient may also receive other drugsto minimize the side effects of the amphotericin B.\nPatients with AIDS must continue to take itracona-\nzole (Sporonox) or fluconazole (Diflucan) orally orreceive weekly intravenous doses of amphotericin B forthe rest of their lives in order to prevent a relapse.Because of the high cost of fluconazole, Pfizer, the man-KEY TERMS\nAbscess —An area of inflamed and injured body\ntissue that fills with pus.\nAcidophilus —The bacteria Lactobacillus aci-\ndophilus that usually found in yogurt.\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\nimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.\nAntigen —A foreign protein to which the body\nreacts by making antibodies.\nAsymptomatic —Persons who carry a disease but\nwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease aresaid to be asymptomatic.\nBifidobacteria —A group of bacteria normally pre-\nsent in the intestine.

This is accomplished by eating a diet lowin dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice,and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple-mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncookedand unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitamins C, E,\nA-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillus\nacidophilus and Bifidobacterium will replenish the good\nbacteria in the intestines. Antifungal herbs, like garlic(Allium sativum ), can be consumed in relatively large\ndoes and for an extended period of time in order toincrease effectiveness.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 835CoccidioidomycosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 835Prognosis\nMost people who are infected with coccidiodomycosis\nonly suffer from the mild, acute form of the disease andrecover without further complications. Patients who sufferfrom chronic coccidiodomycosis and who have no underly-ing lung or immune system diseases also stand a goodchange of recovery, although they must be alert to a relapse.\nThe picture for patients with the disseminated form of\nthe disease, many of whom have AIDS, is less positive.Untreated disseminated coccidiodomycosis is almostalways fatal within a short time. With treatment, chance ofsurvival increases, but the death rate remains high when\nmeningitis or diffuse lung (pulmonary) disease is present.AIDS patients must constantly guard against relapse.\nPrevention\nBecause the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis\nis airborne and microscopic, the only method of preven-tion is to avoid visiting areas where it is found in the soil.Unfortunately, for many people this is impractical. Main-taining general good health and avoiding HIV infectionwill limit coccidioidomycosis to the acute and relativelymild form in most people.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Lung Association. 1740 Broadway, New York, NY\n10019.

    "content": "Coccyx injuries\nDefinition\nThe coccyx—or tailbone—is the last bone of the\nvertebral column, and usually consists of three to fivefused vertebrae that connect with the sacrum, a part ofthe pelvis.\nDescription\nThe coccyx consists of fused vertebrae, which are\nnot flexible like the other vertebrae of the vertebral col-umn which are all interspaced by intervertebral disks andjoined together by elastic ligaments. Since the spinalcord ends just before the coccyx begins, coccygeal verte-brae also lack a central foramen (hole). In the coccyx, thevertebrae generally fuse together in early adulthood andmay also fuse with the sacrum, the bone located betweenthe 5th lumbar vertebra and the coccyx, as a person ages.In males, the coccyx curves downward, and in females, itis straighter to allow a baby to pass through the birthcanal without impediment.\nPain in or around the coccyx is called coccydynia or\ncoccygodynia. Coccydynia presents a range of symptomsassociated to a variety of underlying causes and conditions.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nCoccydynia can be caused by a number of factors.\nUsually, patients report pain after a fall onto their but-tocks, as occurs when going down stairs or while skating.Others have pain during pregnancy or after childbirth .\nSome experience repetitive strain from rowing or cycling,and some cite anal intercourse as the cause of pain. Inmany cases, pain derives from a malformation of the coc-cyx itself. Sometimes bony spurs appear on the coccyx,but only seem to be painful in thin patients who do nothave the padding to protect the region from the spur.\nOther causes of coccydynia include cancer or dam-\nage to the sacrum that generates referred pain, meaningpain that appears in one region but originates from anoth-er. Muscle strain or tension, pinched nerves or damagednerves, or dislocation of the coccyx due to gross obesity\nare other causes.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom of coccydynia, irre-\nspective of the cause of the condition, is pain when sit-ting, or when rising from a sitting position. If the condi-tion lasts long enough, the patient may even experiencepain when standing or lying down. Sometimes, numb-ness occurs in the lower part of the spine. Some patientswill experience pain during bowel movements, sexualintercourse, or menstruation.\nSecondary symptoms include back pain from sitting\nin odd positions in order to relieve pain, and painful feetfrom standing too much, because patients avoid sitting.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 836Coccyx injuriesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 836Sometimes the entire buttocks experience pain.

The most common type of deaf-ness is caused by damaged hair cells in the cochlea, thehearing part of the inner ear. Normally, hair cells stimu-late the hearing nerve, which transmits sound signals tothe brain. When hair cells stop functioning, the hearingnerve remains unstimulated, and the person can’t hear.Hair cells can be destroyed by many things, includinginfection, trauma, loud noise, aging , or birth defects .\nAll cochlear implants consist of a microphone\nworn behind the ear that picks up sound and sends italong a wire to a speech processor, which is worn in asmall shoulder pouch, pocket, or belt. The processorboosts the sound, filters out background noise, andturns sound into digital signals before sending it to atransmitter worn behind the ear. A magnet holds thetransmitter in place through its attraction to thereceiver-stimulator, a part of the device that is surgical-ly attached beneath the skin in the skull. The receiverpicks up digital signs forwarded by the transmitter, andconverts them into electrical impulses. These electricalimpulses flow through electrodes contained in a narrow,flexible tube that has been threaded into the cochlea.As many as 24 electrodes (depending on the type of\nimplant) carry the impulses that stimulate the hearingnerve. The brain then interprets the signals as specificsounds.\nDespite the benefits that the implant appears to offer,\nsome hearing specialists and members of the deaf com-munity still believe that the benefits may not outweighthe risks and limitations of the device. Because thedevice must be surgically implanted, it carries some sur-gical risk. Also, manufacturers can’t promise how well aperson will hear with an implant. Moreover, after gettingan implant, some people say they feel alienated from theDeaf community, while at the same time not feeling fullya part of the hearing world.\nThe sounds heard through an implant are different\nfrom the normal hearing sounds, and have beendescribed as artificial or “robotlike.” This is because theimplant’s handful of electrodes cannot hope to match thecomplexity of a person’s 15,000 hair cells.\nSurgical procedure\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision\nbehind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the ridge onthe skull behind the ear) leading into the middle ear. Thesurgeon then places the receiver-stimulator in the bone,and gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. Thisoperation takes between one and one-half to five hours.\nPreparation\nBefore a person gets an implant, specialists at an\nimplant clinic conduct a careful evaluation, includingextensive hearing tests to determine how well the candi-date can hear.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to predict who will\nbenefit from an implant. In general, the later in life a per-son becomes deaf, and the shorter the duration of deaf-ness, the better the person is likely to understand speechwith an implant. Likewise,someone with a healthy hearingnerve will do better than someone with a damaged nerve.\nFirst, candidates undergo a trial with a powerful hear-\ning aid. If the aid can’t improve hearing enough, a physi-cian then performs a physical exam and orders a scan ofthe inner ear (some patients with a scarred cochlea aren’tgood candidates). A doctor may also order a psychologicalexam to better understand the person’s expectations.Patients need to be highly motivated, and have a realisticunderstanding of what an implant can and cannot do.\nAftercare\nThe patient remains in the hospital for a day or two\nafter the surgery. After a month, the surgical wounds will\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 838Cochlear implants\nA close-up view of a cochlear implant. (Photograph by L.\nSteinmark, Custom Medical Stock Photo.

A clini-cican tunes the speech processor and sets levels of stimu-lation for each electrode, from soft to loud.\nThe patient is then trained in how to interpret the\nsounds heard through the device. The length of the train-ing varies from days to years, depending on how well theperson can interpret the sounds heard through the device.\nRisks\nAs with all operations, there are a few risks of\nsurgery. These include:\n• dizziness\n• facial paralysis (rarely)\n• infection at the incision site\nScientists aren’t sure about the long-term effects of\nelectrical stimulation on the nervous system. It is alsopossible to damage the implant’s internal componentsby a blow to the head, which will render the deviceunworkable.\nNormal results\nMost profoundly, deaf patients who receive an\nimplant are able to discern medium and loud sounds,including speech, at comfortable listening levels. Manyuse sound clues from the implant, together with speechreading and other facial cues. Almost all adults improvetheir communication skills when combining the implantwith speech reading (lip reading), and some can under-stand spoken words without speech reading. More thanhalf of adults who lost hearing after they learned to speakcan understand some speech without speech reading.About 30% can understand spoken sounds well enoughto use the phone.\nChildren who were born deaf or who lost their hear-\ning before they could speak have the most difficulty inlearning to use the implant. Research suggests, however,that most of these children are able to learn spoken lan-guage and understand speech using the implant.\nResources\nBOOKS\nClark, Graeme M., Robert S. C.

    "title": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy",
    "content": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy\nDefinition\nCognitive-behavioral therapy is an action-oriented\nform of psychosocial therapy that assumes that maladap-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 839Cognitive-behavioral therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 839tive, or faulty, thinking patterns cause maladaptive\nbehavior and “negative” emotions. (Maladaptive behav-ior is behavior that is counter-productive or interfereswith everyday living.) The treatment focuses on chang-ing an individual’s thoughts (cognitive patterns) in orderto change his or her behavior and emotional state.\nPurpose\nTheoretically, cognitive-behavioral therapy can be\nemployed in any situation in which there is a pattern ofunwanted behavior accompanied by distress and impair-ment. It is a recommended treatment option for a numberof mental disorders, including affective (mood) disor-ders, personality disorders , social phobia, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, substance\nabuse, anxiety or panic disorder ,agoraphobia ,post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also fre-\nquently used as a tool to deal with chronic pain for\npatients with illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis ,\nback problems, and cancer . Patients with sleep disor-\nders may also find cognitive-behavioral therapy a useful\ntreatment for insomnia .\nPrecautions\nCognitive-behavioral therapy may not be suitable for\nsome patients. Those who don’t have a specific behav-ioral issue they wish to address and whose goals for ther-apy are to gain insight into the past may be better servedby psychodynamic therapy. Patients must also be willingto take a very active role in the treatment process.\nCognitive-behavioral intervention may be inappro-\npriate for some severely psychotic patients and for cogni-tively impaired patients (for example, patients withorganic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury),depending on their level of functioning.\nDescription\nCognitive-behavioral therapy combines the individ-\nual goals of cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy.\nPioneered by psychologists Aaron Beck and Albert\nEllis in the 1960s, cognitive therapy assumes that mal-adaptive behaviors and disturbed mood or emotions arethe result of inappropriate or irrational thinking patterns,called automatic thoughts. Instead of reacting to the real-\nity of a situation, an individual reacts to his or her owndistorted viewpoint of the situation. For example, a per-son may conclude that he is “worthless” simply becausehe failed an exam or didn’t get a date. Cognitive thera-pists attempt to make their patients aware of these dis-torted thinking patterns, or cognitive distortions, and\nchange them (a process termed cognitive restructuring).\nBehavioral therapy, or behavior modification, trains\nindividuals to replace undesirable behaviors with healthi-er behavioral patterns. Unlike psychodynamic therapies,it does not focus on uncovering or understanding theunconscious motivations that may be behind the maladap-tive behavior. In other words, strictly behavioral therapistsdon’t try to find out why their patients behave the waythey do, they just teach them to change the behavior.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy integrates the cogni-\ntive restructuring approach of cognitive therapy with thebehavioral modification techniques of behavioral thera-py. The therapist works with the patient to identify boththe thoughts and the behaviors that are causing distress,and to change those thoughts in order to readjust thebehavior. In some cases, the patient may have certainfundamental core beliefs, called schemas, which areflawed and require modification. For example, a patientsuffering from depression may be avoiding social contactwith others, and suffering considerable emotional dis-tress because of his isolation . When questioned why, the\npatient reveals to his therapist that he is afraid of rejec-tion, of what others may do or say to him. Upon furtherexploration with his therapist, they discover that his realfear is not rejection, but the belief that he is hopelesslyuninteresting and unlovable. His therapist then tests thereality of that assertion by having the patient namefriends and family who love him and enjoy his company.By showing the patient that others value him, the thera-pist both exposes the irrationality of the patient’s beliefand provides him with a new model of thought to changehis old behavior pattern. In this case, the person learns tothink, “I am an interesting and lovable person; therefore Ishould not have difficulty making new friends in socialsituations.” If enough “irrational cognitions” arechanged, this patient may experience considerable relieffrom his depression.\nA number of different techniques may be employed\nin cognitive-behavioral therapy to help patients uncoverand examine their thoughts and change their behaviors.They include:\n• Behavioral homework assignments. Cognitive-behav-\nioral therapists frequently request that their patientscomplete homework assignments between therapy ses-sions. These may consist of real-life “behavioral exper-iments” where patients are encouraged to try out newresponses to situations discussed in therapy sessions.\n• Cognitive rehearsal. The patient imagines a difficult sit-\nuation and the therapist guides him through the step-by-step process of facing and successfully dealing with it.The patient then works on practicing, or rehearsing,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 840Cognitive-behavioral therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 840these steps mentally. Ideally, when the situation arises\nin real life, the patient will draw on the rehearsedbehavior to address it.\n• Journal. Patients are asked to keep a detailed diary\nrecounting their thoughts, feelings, and actions whenspecific situations arise. The journal helps to make thepatient aware of his or her maladaptive thoughts and toshow their consequences on behavior. In later stages oftherapy, it may serve to demonstrate and reinforce posi-tive behaviors.\n• Modeling. The therapist and patient engage in role-\nplaying exercises in which the therapist acts out appro-priate behaviors or responses to situations.\n• Conditioning. The therapist uses reinforcement to\nencourage a particular behavior. For example, a childwith ADHD gets a gold star every time he stays focusedon tasks and accomplishes certain daily chores. Thegold star reinforces and increases the desired behaviorby identifying it with something positive. Reinforce-ment can also be used to extinguish unwanted behav-iors by imposing negative consequences.\n• Systematic desensitization. Patients imagine a situation\nthey fear, while the therapist employs techniques to helpthe patient relax, helping the person cope with their fearreaction and eventually eliminate the anxiety altogether.For example, a patient in treatment for agoraphobia, orfear of open or public places, will relax and then pictureherself on the sidewalk outside of her house. In her nextsession, she may relax herself and then imagine a visit toa crowded shopping mall. The imagery of the anxiety-producing situations gets progressively more intenseuntil, eventually, the therapist and patient approach theanxiety-causing situation in real-life (a “graded expo-sure”), perhaps by visiting a mall. Exposure may beincreased to the point of “flooding,” providing maximumexposure to the real situation. By repeatedly pairing adesired response (relaxation) with a fear-producing situa-tion (open, public spaces), the patient gradually becomesdesensitized to the old response of fear and learns toreact with feelings of relaxation.\n• Validity testing. Patients are asked to test the validity of\nthe automatic thoughts and schemas they encounter.The therapist may ask the patient to defend or produceevidence that a schema is true. If the patient is unable tomeet the challenge, the faulty nature of the schema isexposed.\nInitial treatment sessions are typically spent explain-\ning the basic tenets of cognitive-behavioral therapy to thepatient and establishing a positive working relationshipbetween therapist and patient. Cognitive-behavioral thera-py is a collaborative, action-oriented therapy effort. Assuch, it empowers the patient by giving him an active roleKEY TERMS\nAutomatic thoughts —Thoughts that automatically\ncome to mind when a particular situation occurs.Cognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to challengeautomatic thoughts.\nCognitive restructuring —The process of replacing\nmaladaptive thought patterns with constructivethoughts and beliefs.\nMaladaptive —Unsuitable or counterproductive;\nfor example, maladaptive behavior is behaviorthat is inappropriate to a given situation.\nPsychodynamic therapy —A therapeutic approach\nthat assumes dysfunctional or unwanted behavioris caused by unconscious, internal conflicts andfocuses on gaining insight into these motivations.\nRelaxation technique —A technique used to\nrelieve stress.

Cognitive-behavioral thera-py seeks to change maladaptive schemas.\nin the therapy process and discourages any overdepen-\ndence on the therapist that may occur in other therapeuticrelationships. Therapy is typically administered in an out-patient setting in either an individual or group session.Therapists include psychologists (Ph.D., Psy.D., Ed.D. orM.A. degree), clinical social workers (M.S.W., D.S.W., orL.S.W. degree), counselors (M.A. or M.S. degree), orpsychiatrists (M.D. with specialization in psychiatry) andshould be trained in cognitive-behavioral techniques,although some brief cognitive-behavioral interventionsmay be suggested by a primary physician/caregiver.Treatment is relatively short in comparison to some otherforms of psychotherapy, usually lasting no longer than 16weeks. Many insurance plans provide reimbursement forcognitive-behavioral therapy services. Because coverageis dependent on the disorder or illness the therapy is treat-ing, patients should check with their individual plans.\nRational-emotive behavior therapy\nRational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT) is a pop-\nular variation of cognitive-behavioral therapy developed\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 841Cognitive-behavioral therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 841in 1955 by psychologist Albert Ellis. REBT is based on\nthe belief that a person’s past experiences shape theirbelief system and thinking patterns. People form illogi-cal, irrational thinking patterns that become the cause ofboth their negative emotions and of further irrationalideas. REBT focuses on helping patients discover theseirrational beliefs that guide their behavior and replacethem with rational beliefs and thoughts in order to relievetheir emotional distress.\nThere are 10 basic irrational assumptions that trigger\nmaladaptive emotions and behaviors:\n• It is a necessity for an adult to be loved and approved of\nby almost everyone for virtually everything.\n• A person must be thoroughly competent, adequate, and\nsuccessful in all respects.\n• Certain people are bad, wicked, or villainous and\nshould be punished for their sins.\n• It is catastrophic when things are not going the way one\nwould like.\n• Human unhappiness is externally caused. People have\nlittle or no ability to control their sorrows or to ridthemselves of negative feelings.\n• It is right to be terribly preoccupied with and upset\nabout something that may be dangerous or fearsome.\n• It is easier to avoid facing many of life’s difficulties and\nresponsibilities than it is to undertake more rewardingforms of self-discipline.\n• The past is all-important. Because something once\nstrongly affected someone’s life, it should continue todo so indefinitely.\n• People and things should be different from the way they\nare. It is catastrophic if perfect solutions to the grimrealities of life are not immediately found.\n• Maximal human happiness can be achieved by inertia\nand inaction or by passively and without commitment.\nMeichenbaum’s self-instructional approach\nPsychologist Donald Meichenbaum pioneered the\nself-instructional, or “self-talk,” approach to cognitive-behavioral therapy in the 1970s. This approach focuseson changing what people say to themselves, both inter-nally and out loud. It is based on the belief that an indi-vidual’s actions follow directly from this self-talk. Thistype of therapy emphasizes teaching patients copingskills that they can use in a variety of situations to helpthemselves. The technique used to accomplish this isself-instructional inner dialogue, a method of talkingthrough a problem or situation as it occurs.Preparation\nPatients may seek therapy independently, or be\nreferred for treatment by a primary physician, psycholo-gist, or psychiatrist. Because the patient and therapistwork closely together to achieve specific therapeuticobjectives, it is important that their working relationshipis comfortable and their goals are compatible. Prior tobeginning treatment, the patient and therapist shouldmeet for a consultation session, or mutual interview. Theconsultation gives the therapist the opportunity to makean initial assessment of the patient and recommend acourse of treatment and goals for therapy. It also givesthe patient an opportunity to find out important detailsabout the therapist’s approach to treatment, professionalcredentials, and any other issues of interest.\nIn some managed-care clinical settings, an intake\ninterview or evaluation is required before a patientbegins therapy. The intake interview is used to evaluatethe patient and assign him or her to a therapist. It may beconducted by a psychiatric nurse, counselor, or socialworker.\nNormal results\nMany patients who undergo cognitive-behavioral\ntherapy successfully learn how to replace their mal-adaptive thoughts and behaviors with positive ones thatfacilitate individual growth and happiness. Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be used in conjunction withpharmaceutical and other treatment interventions, sooverall success rates are difficult to gauge. However,success rates of 65% or more have been reported withcognitive-behavioral therapy alone as a treatment forpanic attacks and agoraphobia. Relapse has been report-ed in some patient populations, perhaps due to the briefnature of the therapy, but follow-up sessions can putpatients back on track.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGreenberger, Dennis, and Christine Padesky.

    "content": "Cold agglutinins test\nDefinition\nThe cold agglutinins test is performed to detect the\npresence of antibodies in blood that are sensitive to tem-perature changes. Antibodies are proteins produced bythe immune system in response to specific diseaseagents; autoantibodies are antibodies that the body pro-duces against one of its own substances. Cold agglutininsare autoantibodies that cause red blood cells to clump,but only when the blood is cooled below the normal bodytemperature of 98.6°F (37°C). The clumping is most pro-nounced at temperatures below 78°F (25.6°C).\nPurpose\nThe cold agglutinins test is used to confirm the diag-\nnosis of certain diseases that stimulate the body to pro-duce cold agglutinins. The disease most commonly diag-nosed by this test is mycoplasmal pneumonia ,b u t\nmononucleosis, mumps ,measles ,scarlet fever , some\nparasitic infections, cirrhosis of the liver, and some\ntypes of hemolytic anemia can also cause the formation\nof cold agglutinins. Hemolytic anemias are conditions in\nwhich the blood is low in oxygen because the red bloodcells are breaking down at a faster rate than their normallife expectancy of 120 days. In addition to these illness-es, some people have a benign condition called chroniccold agglutinin disease, in which exposure to cold causestemporary clumping of red blood cells and consequentnumbness in ears, fingers, and toes.\nDescription\nSince cold agglutinins cause red blood cells to\nclump only at temperatures lower than 98.6°F (37°C),the test consists of chilling a sample of the patient’sblood.

    "title": "Cold sore",
    "content": "Cold sore\nDefinition\nA cold sore is a fluid-filled blister which usually\nappears at the edge of the lips. Cold sores are caused by aherpes simplex virus infection.\nDescription\nA cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is\nusually on or around the lips. Other names for a cold soreare fever blister, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes labi-\nalis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often occur onthe lips which distinguishes them from the commoncanker sore, which is usually inside the mouth. Coldsores do not usually occur inside the mouth except dur-ing the initial episode. Canker sores usually form either\non the tongue or inside the cheeks.\nCold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are\neight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only twoof these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause coldsores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virustype 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex virustype 2 infects below the waist. This is not completelytrue. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her-pes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent coldsores are almost always type 1.\nOral herpes is very common. More than 60% of\nAmericans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% ofthose infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most ofthese persons became infected before age 10. Anyonecan become infected by herpes virus and, once infected,the virus remains latent for life. Herpes viruses arespread from person to person by direct skin-to-skin con-tact. The highest risk for spreading the virus is the timeperiod beginning with the appearance of blisters and end-ing with scab formation. However, infected persons neednot have visible blisters to spread the infection to otherssince the virus may be present in the saliva without obvi-ous oral lesions.Viruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria\nare independent and can reproduce on their own, virusesenter human cells and force them to make more virus. Theinfected human cell is usually killed and releases thou-sands of new viruses. The cell death and resulting tissue\ndamage causes the actual cold sores. In addition, the her-pes virus can infect a cell and instead of making the cellproduce new viruses, it hides inside the cell and waits.The herpes virus hides in the nervous system. This iscalled “latency.” A latent virus can wait inside the nervoussystem for days, months, or even years. At some futuretime, the virus “awakens” and causes the cell to producethousands of new viruses that cause an active infection.\nThis process of latency and active infection is best\nunderstood by considering the cold sore cycle. An activeinfection is obvious because cold sores are present. Thefirst infection is called the “primary” infection. This activeinfection is then controlled by the body’s immune systemand the sores heal. In between active infections, the virusis latent. At some point in the future, latent viruses becomeactivated and once again cause sores. These are called“recurrent” infections. Although it is unknown what trig-gers latent virus to activate, several conditions seem tobring on infections. These include stress , illness, tired-\nness, exposure to sunlight, menstruation, fever, and diet.\nCauses and symptoms\nWhile anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not\neveryone will show symptoms. The first symptoms ofherpes occur within two-20 days after contact with aninfected person. Symptoms of the primary infection areusually more severe than those of recurrent infections.The primary infection can cause symptoms like otherviral infections including tiredness, headache , fever, and\nswollen lymph nodes in the neck.\nTypically, 50-80% of persons with oral herpes expe-\nrience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) ofpain , burning, itching , or tingling at the site where blis-\nters will form. This prodrome stage may last anywherefrom a few hours to one to two days. The herpes infec-tion prodrome occurs in both the primary infection andrecurrent infections.\nIn 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters\noccur at the outer edge of the lips which is called the“vermilion border.” Less often, blisters form on the nose,chin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the diseaseprocess is rapid. First, small red bumps appear thatquickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blistersmay either burst and form a scab or dry up and form ascab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all the blis-ters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely andwithout scarring within six to ten days.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 844Cold soreGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 844Some children have a very serious primary (first\nepisode) herpes infection called “gingivostomatitis.” Thiscauses fever, swollen lymph glands, and numerous blis-ters inside the mouth and on the lips and tongue that mayform large, open sores. These painful sores may last upto three weeks and can make eating and drinking diffi-cult. Because of this, young children with gingivostom-atitis are at risk for dehydration (excessive loss of water\nfrom the body).\nMost people experience fewer than two recurrent\noutbreaks of cold sores each year. Some people neverexperience outbreaks, while some have very frequentoutbreaks. In most people, the blisters form in the samearea each time and are triggered by the same factors(such as stress, sun exposure, etc).\nDiagnosis\nBecause oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed\nprimarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and treatedby the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors who spe-cialize in skin diseases) and infectious disease special-ists. Laboratory tests may be performed to look for thevirus. Because healing sores do not shed much virus, asample from an open sore would be taken for viral cul-ture. A sterile cotton swab would be wiped over opensores and the sample used to infect human cells in cul-ture. Cells that are killed by the herpes virus have a cer-tain appearance under microscopic examination. Theresults of this test are available within two to 10 days.\nOral herpes may resemble a bacterial infection called\nimpetigo. This skin infection is most commonly seen inchildren and causes herpes-like blisters around the mouthand nose. Also, because oral herpes can occur inside themouth, the blisters could be mistaken for common cankersores. Therefore, the doctor would need to determinewhether the blisters are oral herpes, canker sores, orimpetigo . The diagnosis and treatment of herpes infec-\ntions should be covered by most insurance providers.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for herpes virus infections. There\nare antiviral drugs available that have some effect on\nlessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of her-pes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also pre-vent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs work byinterfering with the replication of the viruses, and aremost effective when taken as early in the infectionprocess as possible. For the best results, drug treatmentshould begin during the prodrome stage before blistersare visible. Depending on the length of the outbreak,drug treatment could continue for up to 10 days.Acyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes\ninfection and can be given intravenously or taken bymouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointmentbut is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for chil-dren is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treatingboth the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks.When taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovirreduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks.\nDuring an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus\nfoods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the soresshould be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a daywith warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the-counter lip products that contain the chemical phenol(such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbingointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandagemay be placed over the sores to protect them and preventspreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\nmay be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever.\nAlternative treatment\nVitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have\nan effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores. Ingeneral, cold sore sufferers should eat a healthy diet ofunprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, and wholegrains. Alcohol, caffeine , and sugar should be avoided.\nAn imbalance in the amino acids lysine and arginine\nis thought to be one contributing factor in herpes virus out-breaks. A diet that is rich in the amino acid lysine mayhelp prevent recurrences of cold sores. Foods which con-tain high levels of lysine include most vegetables,legumes, fish, turkey, and chicken. In one study, patientstaking lysine supplements had milder symptoms during anoutbreak, a shorter healing time, and had fewer outbreaks\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 845Cold sore\nA close-up view of a patient’s mouth with gingivostomatitis\ncold sores.

Patients should take\n1,000 mg of lysine three times a day during a cold soreoutbreak and 500 mg daily on an ongoing basis to preventrecurrences. Intake of the amino acid arginine should bereduced. Foods rich in arginine that should be avoided arechocolate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds.\nVitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits\nthat helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) havebeen shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore outbreakand reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B complexincludes important vitamins that support the nervous sys-\ntem where viruses can hide out. B complex vitamins canalso help manage stress, an important contributing factorto the outbreak of herpes viruses. Applying the oil in vita-min E capsules directly to cold sores may provide relief.Zinc lozenges appear to affect the reproduction of virusesand also enhance the immune system. Ointments contain-ing lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ) or licorice ( Gly-\ncyrrhiza glabra ) and peppermint ( Mentha piperita ) have\nbeen shown to help cold sores heal.\nPrognosis\nOral herpes can be painful and embarrassing, but it\nis not a serious infection. There is no cure for oral herpes,but outbreaks usually occur less frequently after age 35.The spread of the herpes virus to the eyes is very serious.The herpes virus can infect the cells in the cornea andcause scarring that may impair vision.\nPrevention\nThe only way to prevent oral herpes is to avoid con-\ntact with infected persons. This is not an easy solutionbecause many people aren’t aware that they are infectedand can easily infect others. Currently there are no her-pes vaccines available, although herpes vaccines arebeing tested.KEY TERMS\nLatent —A nonactive virus which is in a dormant\nstate within a cell. The herpes virus is latent in thenervous system.\nProdrome —The Symptoms that warn of the begin-\nning of disease. The herpes prodrome consists ofpain, burning, tingling, or itching at a site beforeblisters are visible.\nRecurrence —The return of an active infection fol-\nlowing a period of latency.Several practices can reduce the occurrence of cold\nsores and the spread of virus to other body locations orpeople. These practices are:\n• Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting\nprolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to theface and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with alarge brim is also helpful.\n• Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or\npinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to otherparts of the lips or face and infect those sites.\n• Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes should\nwash their hands carefully before touching others. Aninfected person can spread the virus to others evenwhen he or she has no obvious blisters.\n• Avoid contact with others during active infection.\nInfected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contactwith others until after the cold sores have healed.\n• Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child’s sore.• Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes\nor lips of a baby who is under six months old.\n• Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow infected\nchildren to share toys that may be put into the mouth.Toys that have been mouthed should be disinfectedbefore other children play with them.\n• Maintain good general health. A healthy diet, plenty of\nsleep, and exercise help to minimize the chance of get-\nting a cold or the flu, which are known to bring on coldsores. Also, good general health keeps the immune sys-tem strong; this helps to keep the virus in check andprevents outbreaks.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGorbach, Sherman, John Bartlett, and Neil Blacklow, eds.\nInfectious Diseases.

It is more common in boys than in girls and mostcommon in a family’s first child. Symptoms of colic usu-ally appear when a baby is 14–21 days old, reach acrescendo at the age of three months, and disappear with-in the next eight weeks. Episodes occur frequently butintermittently and usually begin with prolonged periodsof crying in the late afternoon or evening. They can lastfor just a few minutes or continue for several hours.Some babies who have colic are simply fussy. Others cryso hard that their faces turn red, then pale.\nCauses and symptoms\nNo one knows what causes colic. The condition may\nbe the result of swallowing large amounts of air, whichbecomes trapped in the digestive tract and causes bloat-ing and severe abdominal pain .\nOther possible causes of colic include:\n• digestive tract immaturity\n• food intolerances\n• hunger or overfeeding\n• lack of sleep\n• loneliness\n• overheated milk or formula\n• overstimulation resulting from noise, light, or activity\n• tension\nDuring a colicky episode, babies’ bellies often look\nswollen, feel hard, and make a rumbling sound. Cryingintensifies, tapers off, then gets louder. Many babiesgrow rigid, clench their fists, curl their toes, and drawtheir legs toward their body. A burp or a bowel move-ment can end an attack. Most babies who have colicdon’t seem to be in pain between attacks.\nDiagnosis\nPediatricians and family physicians suspect colic in\nan infant who:\n• has cried loudly for at least three hours a day at least\nthree times a week for three weeks or longer• is not hungry but cries for several hours between din-\nnertime and midnight\n• demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other\nphysical traits associated with colic\nThe baby’s medical history and a parent’s descrip-\ntion of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used toconfirm a diagnosis of colic. Physical examination and\nlaboratory tests are used to rule out infection, intestinalblockage, and other conditions that can cause abdominalpain and other colic-like symptoms.\nTreatment\nMedications do not cure colic. Doctors sometimes\nrecommend simethicone (Mylicon Drops) to relieve gaspain, but generally advise parents to take a practicalapproach to the problem.\nGently massaging the baby’s back can release a\ntrapped gas bubble, and holding the baby in a sittingposition can help prevent air from being swallowed dur-ing feedings. Bottle-fed babies can swallow air if nippleholes are either too large or too small.\nNipple-hole size can be checked by filling a bottle\nwith cold formula, turning it upside down, and countingthe number of drops released when it is shaken orsqueezed. A nipple hole that is the right size will releaseabout one drop of formula every second.\nBabies should not be fed every time they cry, but\nfeeding and burping a baby more often may alleviatesymptoms of colic. A bottle-fed baby should be burpedafter every ounce, and a baby who is breastfeedingshould be burped every five minutes.\nWhen cow’s milk is the source of the symptoms,\nbottle-fed babies should be switched to a soy milkhydrolyzed protein formula. A woman whose baby isbreastfeeding should eliminate dairy products from herdiet for seven days, then gradually reintroduce themunless the baby’s symptoms reappear.\nSince intolerance to foods other than cow’s milk may\nalso lead to symptoms of colic, breastfeeding women mayalso relieve their babies’ colic by eliminating from their diet:\n• coffee\n• tea• cocoa• citrus\n• peanuts\n• wheat• broccoli and other vegetables belonging to the cabbage\nfamily\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 847ColicGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 847Rocking a baby in a quiet, darkened room can pre-\nvent overstimulation, and a baby usually calms downwhen cuddled in a warm, soft blanket.\nColicky babies cry less when they are soothed by the\nmotion of a wind-up swing, a car ride, or being carried ina parent’s arms. Pacifiers can soothe babies who areupset, but a pacifier should never be attached to a string.\nA doctor should be notified if a baby who has been\ndiagnosed with colic:\n• develops a rectal fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\n• cries for more than four hours• vomits• has diarrhea or stools that are black or bloody\n• loses weight\n• eats less than normal\nAlternative treatment\nApplying gentle pressure to the webbed area\nbetween the thumb and index finger of either hand cancalm a crying child. So can gently massaging the areadirectly above the child’s navel and the correspondingspot on the spine. Applying warm compresses or holdingyour hand firmly over the child’s abdomen can relievecramping.\nTeas made with chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ),\nlemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ), peppermint ( Mentha\npiperita ), or dill ( Anethum graveolens ) can lessen bowel\ninflammation and reduce gas. A homeopathic combina-tion called “colic” may be effective, and constitutionalhomeopathic treatment can help strenthen the child’sentire constitution.\nPrognosis\nColic is distressing, but it is not dangerous. Symp-\ntoms almost always disappear before a child is sixmonths old.\nPrevention\nMany doctors believe that colic cannot be prevented.\nSome alternative practitioners, however, feel that coliccan be prevented by an awareness of food intolerancesand their impact.\nResources\nBOOKS\nTaylor, Robert, ed.

    "title": "Colon cancer",
    "content": "Colon cancer\nDefinition\nCancer of the colon is the disease characterized by\nthe development of malignant cells in the lining orepithelium of the first and longest portion of the largeintestine. Malignant cells have lost normal control mech-anisms governing growth. These cells may invade sur-rounding local tissue, or they may spread throughout thebody and invade other organ systems.\nSynonyms for the colon include the large bowel or\nthe large intestine. The rectum is the continuation of thelarge intestine into the pelvis that terminates in the anus.\nDescription\nThe colon is a tubular organ beginning in the right\nlower aspect of the abdomen. Anatomically, it ascends onthe right side of the abdomen, traverses from right to leftin the upper abdomen, descends vertically down the leftside, takes an S-shaped curve in the lower left abdomen,and then flows into the rectum as it leaves the abdomenfor the pelvis. These portions of the colon are named sep-arately though they are part of the same organ:\n• cecum, the beginning of the colon\n• ascending colon, the right vertical ascent of the colon• transverse colon, the portion traversing from right to left\n• descending colon, the left vertical descent of the colon\n• sigmoid colon, the s-shaped segment of colon above the\npelvis\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 848Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 848These portions of the colon are recognized anatomi-\ncally based on the arterial blood supply and venous andlymphatic drainage of these segments of the colon.Lymph, a protein-rich fluid that bathes the cells of thebody, is transported in small channels known as lymphat-ics that run along side the veins of the colon. Lymphnodes are small filters through which the lymph travelson its way back to the blood stream. Cancer can spreadelsewhere in the body by invading the lymph and vascu-lar systems. Therefore, these anatomic considerationsbecome very important in the treatment of colon cancer.\nThe small intestine is the continuation of the upper\ngastrointestinal tract that is responsible for the transportof ingested nutrients into the body. The waste left afterthe small intestine has completed absorption of nutrientsamounts to a few liters (about the same as quart) of mate-rial per day and is directly delivered to the colon (at thececum) for processing. Physiologically, the colon isresponsible for the preservation of fluid and electrolytesas it propels the increasingly solid waste towards the rec-tum and anus for excretion.\nWhen cells lining the colon become malignant, they\nfirst grow locally and may invade partially or totallythrough the wall of the bowel and even into adjacentstructures and organs. In the process, the tumor can pene-trate and invade the lymphatics or the capillaries locallyand it gains access to the circulation. As the malignantcells work their way to other areas of the body, theyagain become locally invasive in the new area to whichthey have spread. These tumor deposits, originating inthe colon primary tumor, are then known as metastases.If metastases are found in the regional lymph nodes fromthe primary, they are known as regional metastases orregional nodal metastases. If they are distant from theprimary tumor, they are known as distant metastases. Thepatient with distant metastases has systemic disease.Thus the cancer originating in the colon begins locallyand, given time, can become systemic in its extent.\nBy the time the primary is originally detected, it is\nusually larger than 0.4 in (1 cm) in size and has over amillion cells. This amount of growth itself is estimated totake about three to seven years. Each time the cells dou-ble in number, the size of the tumor quadruples. Thus,like most cancers, the part that is identified clinically islater in the progression than would be desired andscreening becomes a very important endeavor to aid inearlier detection of this disease.\nThere are about 94,000 cases of colon cancer diag-\nnosed per year in the United States. Together, colon andrectal cancers account for 10% of cancers in men and11% of cancers in women. It is the second most com-mon site-specific cancer affecting both men andwomen. (Lung cancer is the first affecting both men and\nwomen, breast is the leader in women and prostate theleader in men.) Nearly 48,000 people died from coloncancer in the United States in 2000. In recent years theincidence of this disease is decreasing very slightly, ashas the mortality rate. It is difficult to tell if thedecrease in mortality reflects earlier diagnosis, lessdeath related to the actual treatment of the disease, or a\ncombination of both factors.\nCancer of the colon is thought to arise sporadically\nin about 80% of those who develop the disease. Twentypercent of cases are thought to have genetic predisposi-tion that ranges from familial syndromes affecting 50%of the offspring of a mutation carrier, to a risk of 6%when there is just a family history of colon cancer occur-ring in a first degree relative. Development of colon can-cer at an early age, or at multiple sites, or recurrent coloncancer suggests a genetically transmitted form of the dis-ease as opposed to the sporadic form.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses of colon cancer are probably environmental\nin the sporadic cases (80%) and genetic in the hereditypredisposed cases (20%). Since malignant cells have achanged genetic makeup, this means that in 80% ofcases, the environment spontaneously induces change,whereas in those born with a genetic predisposition, theyare either destined to get the cancer or it will take lessenvironmental exposure to induce the cancer. Exposureto agents in the environment that may induce mutation isthe process of carcinogenesis and is caused by agentsknown as carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). Specificcarcinogens have been difficult to identify; however,dietary factors seem to be involved.\nColon cancer is more common in industrialized\nnations and diets high in fat, red meat, total calories, and\nalcohol seem to predispose. Diets high in fiber are asso-ciated with a decreased risk. The mechanism for protec-tion by high-fiber diets may be related to less exposure ofthe colon lining to carcinogens from the environment, asthe transit time through the bowel is faster with a high-fiber diet than it is with a low-fiber diet.\nAge plays a definite role in the predisposition to\ncolon cancer. Colon cancer is uncommon before age 40.This incidence increases substantially after age 50 anddoubles with each succeeding decade.\nThere is also a slight increase risk for colon cancer\nin the individual who smokes.\nPatients who suffer from inflammatory diseases of\nthe colon known as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis\nare also at increased risk.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 849Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 849As for genetic predisposition, on chromosome 5,\nthere is a gene called the APC gene associated with thefamilial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. There aremultiple different mutations that occur at this site, yetthey all cause a defect in tumor suppression that resultsin early and frequent development of colon cancer. Thisgenetic aberration is transmitted to 50% of offspring andeach of those affected will develop colon cancer, usuallyat an early age. There is another syndrome, hereditarynon-polyposis colon cancer (also known as Lynch syn-drome), related to mutations in any of four genes respon-sible for DNA mismatch repair. In patients with coloncancer, the p53 gene is mutated 70% of the time. Whenthe p53 gene is mutated and ineffective, cells with dam-aged DNA escape repair or destruction. This allows forthe damaged cell to perpetuate itself, and continuedreplication of the damaged DNA may lead to tumordevelopment. Though these syndromes have a very highincidence of colon cancer, family history without thesyndrome is also a substantial risk factor. When consid-ering first-degree relatives, history of one with colon can-cer raises the baseline risk of 2% to 6%. (Most physi-cians think that this baseline is about 4%.) The presenceof a second raises the risk to 17%.\nThe development of polyps of the colon almost\nalways precedes the development of colon cancer by fiveor more years. Polyps are benign growths of the colonlining. They can be unrelated to cancer, precancerous, ormalignant. Polyps, when identified, are removed fordiagnosis. If the polyps are benign, the patient shouldundergo careful surveillance for the development ofmore polyps or the development of colon cancer.\nColon cancer causes symptoms related to its local\npresence in the large bowel or by its effect on otherorgans if it has spread. These symptoms may occur aloneor in combination:\n• a change in bowel habit• blood in the stool• bloating, persistent abdominal distention\n• constipation\n• a feeling of fullness even after having a bowel move-\nment\n• narrowing of the stool—so-called ribbon stools\n• persistent, chronic fatigue\n• abdominal discomfort• unexplained weight loss\n• very rarely, nausea and vomiting\nMost of these symptoms are caused by the physical\npresence of the tumor mass in the colon. Similar symp-toms can be caused by other processes; these are not\nabsolutely specific to colon cancer. The key is recogniz-ing that the persistence of these types of symptoms with-out ready explanation should prompt the individual toseek medical evaluation.\nMany of the symptoms are understood by remem-\nbering that the colon is a tubular conduit. If a tumordevelops, as it reaches a certain size it will begin to causesymptoms related to the obstruction of that conduit. Inaddition, the tumor commonly oozes blood that is lost inthe stool. (Often, this blood is not visible.) This phenom-enon results in anemia and chronic fatigue. Weight loss isa late symptom, often implying substantial obstruction orthe presence of systemic disease.\nDiagnosis\nScreening\nOf all of the major cancers, only colorectal cancer\ncan be prevented by screening. In all other cancers (breastand prostate, for example), screening tests look for small,malignant lesions. Screening for colorectal cancers, how-ever, is the search for pre-malignant, benign polyps. Thisscreening can be close to 100% effective in preventingcancer development, not just in detecting small cancers.\nScreening involves physical exam, simple laboratory\ntests, and the visualization of the lining of the colon. Theways to visualize the colon epithelium are with x rays (indi-rect visualization), and endoscopy (direct visualization).\nThe physical examination involves the perfor-\nmance of a digital rectal exam (DRE). The DRE includesmanual examination of the rectum, anus, and theprostate. During this examination, the physician exam-ines the anus and the surrounding skin for hemorrhoids ,\nabscesses, and other irregularities. After lubricating thegloved finger and anus, the examiner gently slides thefinger into the anus and follows the contours of the rec-tum. The examiner notes the tone of the anus and feelsthe walls and the edges for texture, tenderness and mass-es as far as the examining finger can reach. At the time ofthis exam, the physician checks the stool on the examin-ing glove with a chemical to see if any occult (invisible),blood is present. At home, after having a bowel move-ment, the patient is asked to swipe a sample of stoolobtained with a small stick on a card. After 3 such speci-mens are on the card, the card is then easily chemicallytested for occult blood also. (The stool analysis men-tioned here is known as a fecal occult blood test ,o r\nFOBT, and, while it can be helpful, it is not 100% accu-rate—only about 50% of cancers are FOBT-positive.)These exams are accomplished as an easy part of a rou-tine yearly physical exam.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 850Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 850Proteins are sometimes produced by cancers, and\nthese may be elevated in the patient’s blood. When thisoccurs, the protein produced is known as a tumor marker.There is a tumor marker for some cancers of the colon; itis known as carcinoembryonic antigen, or CEA. Unfortu-nately, this protein may be made by other adenocarcino-mas as well, or it may not be produced by a particularcolon cancer. Therefore, screening by chemical analysisfor CEA has not been helpful. CEA has been helpfulwhen used in a follow-up role for patients treated forcolon cancer if their tumor makes the protein.\nIndirect visualization of the colon may be accom-\nplished by placing barium through the rectum and filling thecolon with this compound. Barium produces a white con-trast image of the lining of the colon on x ray and thus, thecontour of the lining of the colon may be seen. Detail can beincreased if the barium utilized is thinned and air also intro-duced. These studies are known as the barium enema (BE)\nand the double contrast barium enema (DCBE).\nDirect visualization of the lining of the colon is\naccomplished using a scope or endoscope. The physicianintroduces the instrument through the rectum and passesit proximally, visualizing the colon epithelium in theprocess. Older, shorter scopes were rigid. Today, utiliz-ing fiberoptic technology, the scopes are flexible and canreach much farther. If the left colon only is visualized, itis called flexible sigmoidoscopy . When the entire colon\nis visualized, the procedure is known as colonoscopy .\nUnlike the indirect visualizations of the colon (the\nBE and the DCBE), the endoscopic screeenings allow thephysician to remove polyps and biopsy suspicious tissue.(A biopsy is a removal of tissue for examination by apthologist.) For this reason, many physicians prefer endo-scopic screening. All of the visualizations, the BE,DCBE, and each type of endoscopy require pre-procedurepreparation (evacuation) of the colon.\nThe American Cancer Society has recommended the\nfollowing screening protocol for those of normal riskover 50 years of age:\n• yearly DRE with occult blood in stool testing• flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 50• flexible sigmoidoscopy repeated every five years\nMany physicians, however, recommend full colono-\nscopy every five to seven years. Screening evaluationsshould start sooner for patients who have predisposingfactors, such as family history, history of polyps, or afamilial syndrome.\nEvaluation of patients with symptoms\nFor those whose symptoms prompt them to visit\ntheir physician, and if their symptoms could possibly berelated to colon cancer, the entire colon will be inspect-\ned. The combination of a flexible sigmoidoscopy andDCBE may be performed but the preferred evaluation ofthe entire colon and rectum is that of completecolonoscopy. Colonoscopy allows direct visualization,photography, and the opportunity to obtain a biopsy ofany abnormality visualized. If, for technical reasons, theentire colon is not visualized endoscopically, a DCBEshould complement the colonoscopy.\nThe diagnosis of colon cancer is actually made by\nthe performance of a biopsy of any abnormal lesion inthe colon. When a tumor growth is identified, it could beeither a benign polyp (or lesion) or a cancer; the biopsyresolves the issue. The endoscopist may take many sam-ples so as to exclude any sampling errors.\nIf the patient presents with advanced disease, or has\nadvanced disease at the time of diagnosis, areas wherethe tumor has spread (such as the liver) may be amenableto biopsy. Such biopsies are usually obtained using a spe-cial needle under local anesthesia.\nOnce a diagnosis of colon cancer has been estab-\nlished by biopsy, in addition to the physical exam,studies will be performed to assess the extent of thedisease. Blood studies include a complete blood\ncount ,liver function tests , and a CEA. Imaging stud-\nies will include a chest x ray and a CAT scan (comput-\ned tomography scan) of the abdomen. The chest x raywill determine if there is spread to the lung, and theCAT scan will evaluate potential spread to the liver aswell as any local invasive characteristics of the primarytumor. If the patient has any neurologic symptoms, aCAT scan of the brain will be performed, and if the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 851Colon cancer\nA colon with a cancerous growth.

Using thecharacteristics of the primary tumor, its depth of penetra-tion through the bowel, and the presence or absence ofregional or distant metastases, the stage of the cancer isderived. Often, the depth of penetration through thebowel or the presence of regional lymph nodes can’t beassigned before surgery.\nColon cancer is assigned stages I through IV based\non the following general criteria:\n• Stage I: the tumor is confined to the epithelium or has\nnot penetrated through the first layer of muscle in thebowel wall.\n• Stage II: the tumor has penetrated through to the outer\nwall of the colon or has gone through it, possibly invad-ing other local tissue.\n• Stage III: any depth or size of tumor associated with\nregional lymph node involvement.KEY TERMS\nAdenocarcinoma —Type of cancer beginning in\nglandular epithelium.\nAdjuvant therapy —Treatment involving radiation,\nchemotherapy (drug treatment), or hormone thera-py, or a combination of all three given after the pri-mary treatment for the possibility of residual micro-scopic disease.\nAnastomosis —Surgical reconnection of the ends of\nthe bowel after removal of a portion of the bowel.\nAnemia —The condition caused by too few circulat-\ning red blood cells, often manifested in part byfatigue.\nCarcinogens —Substances in the environment that\ncause cancer, presumably by inducing mutations,with prolonged exposure.\nElectrolytes —Salts, such as sodium and chloride.\nEpithelium —Cells composing the lining of an\norgan.\nLymphatics —Channels that are conduits for lymph.\nLymph nodes —Cellular filters through which lym-\nphatics flow.Malignant —Cells that have been altered such that\nthey have lost normal control mechanisms and arecapable of local invasion and spread to other areasof the body.\nMetastasis —Site of invasive tumor growth that orig-\ninated from a malignancy elsewhere in the body.\nMutation —A change in the genetic makeup of a\ncell that may occur spontaneously or be environ-mentally induced.\nOccult blood —Presence of blood that cannot be\nseen with the naked eye.\nPolyps —Localized growths of the epithelium that\ncan be benign, precancerous, or harbor malig-nancy.\nRadical resection —Surgical resection that takes the\nblood supply and lymph system supplying theorgan along with the organ.\nResect —To remove surgically.\nSacrum —Posterior bony wall of the pelvis.\nSystemic —Referring to throughout the body.\n• Stage IV: any of previous criteria associated with dis-\ntant metastasis.\nWith many cancers other than colon cancer, staging\nplays an important pre-treatment role to best determinetreatment options. In colon cancer, almost all colon can-cers are treated with surgery first, regardless of stage.Colon cancers through stage III, and even some stage IVcolon cancers, are treated with surgery first before anyother treatments are considered.\nSurgery\nSurgical removal of the involved anatomic segment\nof colon (colectomy) along with its blood supply andregional lymph nodes is the primary therapy for coloncancer. Usually, on the basis of the blood supply, the par-tial colectomies are separated into right, left, transverse,or sigmoid. The removal of the blood supply at its originalong with the regional lymph nodes that accompany itassures an adequate margin of normal colon on eitherside of the primary tumor. When the cancer lies in a posi-tion such that the blood supply and lymph drainage liesbetween two of the major vessels, both vessels are takento assure complete radical resection or removal (extend-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 852Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 852ed radical right or left colectomy). If the primary tumor\npenetrates through the bowel wall, any tissue adjacent tothe tumor extension is also taken if feasible.\nSurgery is used as primary therapy for stages I\nthrough III colon cancer unless there are signs that localinvasion will not permit complete removal of the tumor,as may occur in advanced stage III tumors. However, thiscircumstance is very rare, and occurs in less than 2% ofall colon cancer cases.\nAfter the resection is completed, the ends of the\nremaining colon are reconstructed; the hook-up is calledan anastomosis. Once healing has occurred, there may be aslight increase in the frequency of bowel movements. Thiseffect usually lasts only for several weeks. Most patientsgo on to develop completely normal bowel function.\nOccasionally, the anastomosis would be risky and\ncannot be performed. (Most commonly, this occurs whenthe bowel could not be adequately evacuated in an emer-gency circumstance due to bowel obstruction.) When theanastomosis cannot be performed, a colostomy is per-\nformed instead. A colostomy is performed by bringing theend of the colon through the abdominal wall and sewing itto the skin. The patient will have to wear an appliance (abag) to manage the stool. The colostomy may be tempo-rary and the patient may undergo a hook-up at a later, saferdate, or the colostomy may be permanent. In most cases,emergent colostomies are not reversed and are permanent.\nRadiation\nRadiation therapy is used as an adjunct to surgery\nif there is concern about potential for local recurrencepost-operatively and the area of concern will tolerate theradiation. For instance, if the tumor invaded muscle ofthe abdominal wall but was not completely removed, thisarea would be considered for radiation. Radiation hassignificant dose limits when residual bowel is exposed toit because the small and large intestine do not tolerateradiation well.\nRadiation is also used in the treatment of patients\nwho present with or progress to having metastatic dis-ease. It is particularly useful in shrinking metastaticcolon cancer to the brain.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is useful for patients who have had\nall identifiable tumor removed and are at risk for recur-rence (adjuvant chemotherapy). Chemotherapy may alsobe used when the cancer is stage IV and is beyond thescope of regional therapy, but this use is rare.\nAdjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease\nwith deep penetration or in stage III patients. Standardtherapy is treatment with 5-fluorouracil, (5FU) combined\nwith leucovorin for a period of six to 12 months. 5FU isan antimetabolite and leukovorin improves the responserate. (A response is a temporary regression of the cancerin response to the chemotherapy.) Another agent, lev-amisole, (which seems to stimulate the immune system),may be substituted for leucovorin. These protocolsreduce rate of recurrence by about 15% and reduce mor-tality by about 10%. The regimens do have some toxicity,but usually are tolerated fairly well.\nSimilar chemotherapy may be administered for stage\nIV disease or if a patient progresses and develops metas-tases. Results show response rates of about 20%. Unfortu-nately, these patients eventually succumb to the disease,and this chemotherapy may not prolong survival orimprove quality of life in Stage IV patients. Clinical trialshave now shown that the results can be improved with theaddition of another agent to this regimen. Irinotecan doesnot seem to increase toxicity but it improved response ratesto 39%, added two to three months to disease-free survival,and prolonged overall survival by a little over two months.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative therapies have not been studied in a\nlarge-scale, scientific way. Large doses of vitamins ,\nfiber, and green tea are among therapies tried. Avoidingcigarettes and alcohol may be helpful. Before initiatingany alternative therapies, the patient is wise to consulthis/her physician to be sure that these therapies do notcomplicate or interfere with the established therapy.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis is the long-term outlook or survival after\ntherapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated for coloncancer survive the disease. As expected, the survival ratesare dependent upon the stage of the cancer at the time ofdiagnosis, making early detection a very worthwhileendeavor.\nAbout 15% of patients present with stage I disease\nand 85–90% survive. Stage II represents 20–30% ofcases and 65–75% survive. Thirt to forty percent com-prise the stage III presentation of which 55% survive.The remaining 20–25% present with stage IV diseaseand are very rarely cured.\nPrevention\nThere is not an absolute way of preventing colon\ncancer. Still, there are steps an individual can take to dra-matically lessen the risk or to identify the precursors ofcolon cancer so that it does not manifest itself. Thepatient with a familial history can enter screening and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 853Colon cancerGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 853surveillance programs earlier than the general popula-\ntion. High-fiber diets and vitamins, avoiding obesity , and\nstaying active lessen the risk. Avoiding cigarettes andalcohol may be helpful. By controlling these environ-mental factors, an individual can lessen risk and to thisdegree prevent the disease.\nBy undergoing appropriate screening when uncon-\ntrollable genetic risk factors have been identified, anindividual may be rewarded by the identification ofbenign polyps that can be treated as opposed to havingthese growths degenerate into a malignancy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAbelhoff, Martin, James O.

    "title": "Colonic irrigation",
    "content": "Colonic irrigation\nDefinition\nColonic irrigation is also known as hydrotherapy of\nthe colon, high colonic, entero-lavage, or simply colonic. Itis the process of cleansing the colon by passing several gal-lons of water through it with the use of special equipment.It is similar to an enema but treats the whole colon, not justthe lower bowel. This has the effect of flushing out impact-ed fecal matter, toxins, mucous, and even parasites thatoften build up over the passage of time. It is a procedurethat should only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner.\nPurpose\nAnyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping\npains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list\nof bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritablebowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic-ular, cancer patients are often advised to undertake a\ncourse of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential partof their treatment. When a biological cancer therapybegins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerousmass, it is essential that speedy and effective eliminationof the resulting toxins is achieved.\nColon and bowel cancer is one of the leading causes\nof death in the United States, and alternative practitioners\ninsist that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene proce-dures. Providing that care is taken to replace the naturalorganisms that flourish in the bowel, many health benefitscan be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, alter-native practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning bowelis the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it cleanwill be an effective protection against this.\nRemoving large amounts of toxic matter relieves the\npatient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms suchas arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome ,candidiasis , and\na host of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irriga-tion can help restore normal peristaltic action to a slug-gish bowel, thus reducing the need for more hydrotherapytreatments over time. In addition, removing the layer offecal matter which coats the intestines in many individu-als allows improved assimilation of the nutrients fromfoods and can alleviate symptoms of vitamin and othernutrient deficiencies. Many alternative health practition-ers consider some form of hydrotherapy for the bowel tobe essential in the treatment of degenerative diseases.\nDescription\nOrigins\nCleansing the colon with the use of hydrotherapy is\nnot a new concept. Forms of colonic irrigation have beenused successfully for decades to relieve chronic toxicityand even acute cases of toxemia.\nOver time, many people develop a thick layer of\nfecal matter that coats their colon. It hardens andbecomes impacted, reducing the efficiency of the bowel,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 854Colonic irrigationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 854and in some cases, completely obstructing normal elimi-\nnation of waste matter from the body. It is quite commonfor people to only have one bowel movement per day,and some as few as one or two per week.\nAlternative practitioners advise that we probably\nshould have one bowel movement for every meal that weeat. If not, then we are not eliminating wastes complete-ly, and if input exceeds output, then we will surely sufferthe consequences at some point.\nIncomplete elimination of body wastes may result in\nthe following, depending on where the deposits end up:\n• sluggish system\n• joint pain and arthritis\n• irritable bowel syndrome• diverticulitis\n•Crohn’s disease\n• leaky gut syndrome• heart problem• migraine\n•allergies\n• bad breath• acne and other skin problems such as psoriasis• asthma• early senility and Alzheimer’s disease\n• chronic fatigue syndrome\n• cancer, particularly of the bowel• multiple sclerosis\nDuring colonic irrigation, a small speculum is\npassed into the patient’s bowel through the rectum. Thisis attached to a tube, which leads to a machine thatpumps temperature-controlled water into the colon at acontrolled rate (to be controlled by either the practitioneror the patient). The temperature of the water should ide-ally be kept as close to body temperature as possible.\nThe patient will temporarily be filled with water up\nto the level of the entire colon. Patients say they can feelthe water up under their ribs but that the process,although sometimes uncomfortable, is not painful. Theamount of water will vary but will generally be in theregion of between two and six liters (or quarts) at anyone time. This triggers peristaltic action and the patientwill begin to expel the water along with fecal matter backthrough the tube and into the machine.\nThe fecal matter is flushed out through a viewing\ntube, so that what is eliminated may be monitored. Quiteoften, unsuspected parasites are expelled, along withvery old fecal material, very dark in color, which mayKEY TERMS\nDysbiosis —The condition that results when the\nnatural flora of the gut are thrown out of balance,such as when antibiotics are taken.\nPeristalsis —The natural wave-like action of a\nhealthy bowel that transports matter from one endof the bowel to the other.\nProbiotics —Supplements of beneficial microor-\nganisms that normally colonize the gut.\nToxemia —Poisoning of the blood.\nhave been in the colon for years. Some therapists com-\nment that it looks like aging rubber.\nDuring the treatment, the therapist will gently massage\nthe patient’s abdomen to help dislodge impacted fecal mat-ter. In addition to massage, sometimes acupressure ,\nreflexology , or lymphatic drainage techniques may be used\nto loosen deposits and stimulate the bowel. It is importantthat the right amount of water is used, as too much willcause discomfort and too little will be ineffective. If cor-rectly done, colonic irrigation is not painful at all and somepatients claim to sleep through their treatment.\nSanitation is vital to this process. The tubes and\nspeculums used are generally disposable, but other partsof the machine, such as the viewing tube, must be steril-ized after each patient.\nNormally, a series of treatments will be required to\nachieve desired results regarding the elimination ofimpacted, decaying matter, and restoration of bowel reg-ularity. Initially, only gas and recent fecal matter may beexpelled. The residue attached to the colon wall is usual-ly the result of years of neglect, and therapists say thatone cannot expect complete relief in only one session.\nImpacted fecal matter can cause an imbalance of the\nnatural organisms that normally populate the bowel, caus-ing what is known as dysbiosis. Under ideal conditions,the bowel is populated by a variety of naturally occurringorganisms. It seems that the enzymes occurring in freshfruit and vegetables encourage these beneficial organ-isms. One of the results of eating processed denaturedfoods is that this natural balance is upset, and food maybegin to rot in the bowel instead of being processed.\nDecomposing matter can cause a toxic condition and\nmay lead to many health problems, as constipation caus-\nes backed up pollution of the body cells.

The cost of themachine itself ranges from $4,000–12,000, but again, itshould be noted that only qualified therapists shouldconduct sessions.\nPreparations\nMost practitioners prefer that distilled or purified\nwater is used for colonic irrigation, but others use steril-ized tap water.\nPrecautions\nIt may be advisable to use a probiotic pessary after\ncolonic irrigation, to ensure replacement of desirable nat-ural flora. There are certain conditions that either partlyor completely preclude the use of colonic irrigation, suchas an active attack of Crohn’s disease, bleeding ulcers,and hyperacidosis. If in doubt, a qualified practitionershould be consulted. Anyone suffering from these condi-tions should always notify the practitioner when receiv-ing colonic irrigation treatments.\nSide effects\nSome allopathic practitioners claim that colonic irri-\ngation flushes out essential electrolytes and friendly bac-teria from the bowel and that it can be dangerous. Practi-tioners counter that this can easily be remedied with theuse of probiotics, and that in any case, these possible dis-advantages are easily offset by the benefits of havinglarge amounts of putrefying matter, harmful organisms,and parasites removed from the system.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAlthough many alternative health care practitioners\nswear by colonic irrigation, there is a large allopathiclobby that claims that there are no benefits to be had, andthat there are dangers involved. However, there are manydecades of records and research from the alternativehealth care community that indicate that this therapy mayhave a valuable place in the treatment of degenerativediseases and toxic conditions.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBonk, Melinda, ed.

    "content": "Colonoscopy\nDefinition\nColonoscopy is a medical procedure where a long,\nflexible, tubular instrument called the colonoscope isused to view the entire inner lining of the colon (largeintestine) and the rectum.\nPurpose\nA colonoscopy is generally recommended when the\npatient complains of rectal bleeding or has a change inbowel habits and other unexplained abdominal symp-toms. The test is frequently used to test for colorectalcancer , especially when polyps or tumor-like growths\nhave been detected using the barium enema and other\ndiagnostic tests. Polyps can be removed through thecolonoscope and samples of tissue (biopsies) can betaken to test for the presence of cancerous cells.\nThe test also enables the physician to check for\nbowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s\ndisease . It is a necessary tool in monitoring patients who\nhave a past history of polyps or colon cancer .\nDescription\nThe procedure can be done either in the doctor’s\noffice or in a special procedure room of a local hospital.An intravenous (IV) line will be started in a vein in thearm. The patient is generally given a sedative and a pain-killer through the IV line.\nDuring the colonoscopy, the patient will be asked to\nlie on his/her left side with his/her knees drawn uptowards the abdomen. The doctor begins the procedureby inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into the anus tocheck for any abnormal masses or blockage. A thin, well-lubricated colonoscope will then be inserted into the anusand it will be gently advanced through the colon. The lin-ing of the intestine will be examined through the scope.Occasionally air may be pumped through the colono-scope to help clear the path or open the colon. If there are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 856ColonoscopyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 856excessive secretions, stool, or blood that obstruct the\nviewing, they will be suctioned out through the scope.The doctor may press on the abdomen or ask the patientto change his/her position in order to advance the scopethrough the colon.\nThe entire length of the large intestine can be exam-\nined in this manner. If suspicious growths are observed,tiny biopsy forceps or brushes can be inserted throughthe colon and tissue samples can be obtained. Smallpolyps can also be removed through the colonoscope.After the procedure, the colonoscope is slowly with-drawn and the instilled air is allowed to escape. The analarea is then cleansed with tissues.\nThe procedure may take anywhere from 30 minutes\nto two hours depending on how easy it is to advance thescope through the colon. Colonoscopy can be a long anduncomfortable procedure, and the bowel cleaning prepa-ration may be tiring and can produce diarrhea and\ncramping. During the colonoscopy, the sedative and thepain medications will keep the patient very drowsy and\nrelaxed. Most patients complain of minor discomfort andpressure from the colonoscope moving inside. However,the procedure is not painful.\nPreparation\nThe doctor should be notified if the patient has aller-\ngies to any medications or anesthetics; any bleeding\nproblems; or if the woman is pregnant. The doctor shouldalso be informed of all the medications that the person iscurrently on and if he or she has had a barium x-rayexamination recently.

Hence, before theexamination, considerable preparation is necessary toclear the colon of all stool. The patient will be asked torefrain from eating any solid food for 24–48 hours beforethe test. Only clear liquids such as juices, broth, and Jelloare recommended. The patient is advised to drink plentyof water to avoid dehydration . The evening before the\ntest, the patient will have to take a strong laxative that thedoctor has prescribed. Several 1 qt enemas of warm tap\nwater may have to be taken on the morning of the exam.Commercial enemas (e.g., Fleet) may be used.\nThe patient will be given specific instructions on\nhow to use the enema and how many such enemas arenecessary.

Very rarely (two in 1000 cases) there may be aperforation (a hole) in the intestinal wall. Heavy bleedingdue to the removal of the polyp or from the biopsy siteoccurs very infrequently (one in 1000 cases). Infectionsdue to a colonoscopy are also extremely rare.

    "title": "Color blindness",
    "content": "Color blindness\nDefinition\nColor blindness is an abnormal condition character-\nized by the inability to clearly distinguish different colorsof the spectrum. The difficulties can be mild to severe. Itis a misleading term because people with color blindnessare not blind. Rather, they tend to see colors in a limitedrange of hues; a rare few may not see colors at all.\nDescription\nNormal color vision requires the use of specialized\nreceptor cells called cones, which are located in the reti-na of the eye. There are three types of cones, termed red,blue, and green, which enable people to see a wide spec-trum of colors. An abnormality, or deficiency, of any ofthe types of cones will result in abnormal color vision.\nThere are three basic variants of color blindness.\nRed/green color blindness (deuteranopia) is the mostcommon deficiency, affecting 8% of Caucasian malesand 0.5% of Caucasian females. The prevalence varieswith culture.Blue color blindness (protanopia) is an inability to\ndistinguish both blue and yellow, which are seen as whiteor gray. Protanopia is quite rare and has equal prevalencein males and females. It is common for young children tohave blue/green confusion that becomes less pronouncedin adulthood. Blue color deficiency often appears in peo-ple who have physical disorders such as liver disease ordiabetes mellitus .\nA total inability to distinguish colors (achromatop-\nsia) is exceedingly rare. These affected individuals viewthe world in shades of gray. They frequently have poorvisual acuity and are extremely sensitive to light (photo-phobia), which causes them to squint in ordinary light.\nResearchers studying red/green color blindness in\nthe United Kingdom reported an average prevalence ofonly 4.7% in one group. Only 1% of Eskimo males arecolor blind. Approximately 2.9% of boys from SaudiArabia and 3.7% from India were found to have deficientcolor vision. Red/green color blindness may slightlyincrease an affected person’s chances of contracting lep-\nrosy. Pre-term infants exhibit an increased prevalence of\nblue color blindness. Achromatopsia has a prevalence ofabout 1 in 33,000 in the United States and affects malesand females equally.\nCauses and symptoms\nRed/green and blue color blindness appear to be\nlocated on at least two different gene locations. Themajority of affected individuals are males. Females arecarriers, but are not normally affected. This indicates thatthe X chromosome is one of the locations for color blind-ness. Male offspring of females who carry the alteredgene have a 50-50 chance of being color-blind. The rarefemale that has red/green color blindness, or rarer still,blue color blindness, indicates there is an involvement ofanother gene. As of 2001, the location of this gene hasnot been identified.\nAchromatopsia, the complete inability to distinguish\ncolor, is an autosomal recessive disease of the retina.This means that both parents have one copy of the alteredgene but do not have the disease. Each of their childrenhas a 25% chance of not having the gene, a 50% chanceof having one altered gene (and, like the parents, beingunaffected), and a 25% risk of having both the alteredgene and the condition. In 1997, the achromatopsia genewas located on chromosome 2.\nThe inability to correctly identify colors is the only\nsign of color blindness. It is important to note that peoplewith red/green or blue varieties of color blindness useother cues such as color saturation and object shape orlocation to distinguish colors. They can often distinguish\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 859Color blindnessGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 859red or green if they can visually compare the colors.\nHowever, most have difficulty accurately identifying col-ors without any other references. Most people with anyimpairment in color vision learn colors, as do otheryoung children. These individuals often reach adoles-cence before their visual deficiency is identified.\nColor blindness is sometimes acquired. Chronic ill-\nnesses that can lead to color blindness include Alzheimer’s\ndisease , diabetes mellitus, glaucoma , leukemia, liver dis-\nease, chronic alcoholism ,macular degeneration ,multi-\nple sclerosis ,Parkinson’s disease , sickle cell anemia, and\nretinitis pigmentosa . Accidents or strokes that damage the\nretina or affect particular areas of the brain eye can lead tocolor blindness. Some medications such as antibiotics ,\nbarbiturates , anti-tuberculosis drugs, high blood pressure\nmedications, and several medications used to treat nervousdisorders and psychological problems may cause colorblindness. Industrial or environmental chemicals such ascarbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, fertilizers, styrene, andsome containing lead can cause loss of color vision. Occa-sionally, changes can occur in the affected person’s capaci-ty to see colors after age 60.\nDiagnosis\nThere are several tests available to identify problems\nassociated with color vision. The most commonly used isthe American Optical/Hardy, Rand, and Ritter Pseudo-isochromatic test. It is composed of several discs filledwith colored dots of different sizes and colors. A personwith normal color vision looking at a test item sees aKEY TERMS\nAchromatopsia —The inability to distinguish any\ncolors.\nCones —Receptor cells that allow the perception\nof colors.\nDeuteranopia —The inability or difficulty in distin-\nguishing red/green colors.\nPhotophobia —An extreme sensitivity to light.\nProtanopia —The inability of difficulty in distin-\nguishing blue and yellow colors.\nRetina —The light-sensitive layer of tissue in the\nback of the eye that receives and transmits visualsignals to the brain through the optic nerve.\nRod—Photoreceptor that is highly sensitive to low\nlevels of light and transmits images in shades of gray.number that is clearly located somewhere in the center of\na circle of variously colored dots. A color-blind person isnot able to distinguish the number.\nThe Ishihara test is comprised of eight plates that are\nsimilar to the American Optical Pseudoisochromatic testplates. The individual being tested looks for numbersamong the various colored dots on each test plate. Someplates distinguish between red/green and blue colorblindness. Individuals with normal color vision perceiveone number. Those with red/green color deficiency see adifferent number. Those with blue color vision see yet adifferent number.\nA third analytical tool is the Titmus II Vision Tester\nColor Perception test. The subject looks into a stereo-scopic machine. The test stimulus most often used inprofessional offices contains six different designs ornumbers on a black background, framed in a yellow bor-der. Titmus II can test one eye at a time. However, itsvalue is limited because it can only identify red/greendeficiencies and is not highly accurate.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment or cure for color blindness.\nMost color vision deficient persons compensate well fortheir abnormality and usually rely on color cues anddetails that are not consciously evident to persons withtypical color vision.\nInherited color blindness cannot be prevented. In the\ncase of some types of acquired color deficiency, if thecause of the problem is removed, the condition mayimprove with time. But for most people with acquiredcolor blindness, the damage is usually permanent.\nPrognosis\nColor blindness that is inherited is present in both\neyes and remains constant over an individual’s entire life.Some cases of acquired color vision loss are not severe,may appear in only one eye, and last for only a shorttime. Other cases tend to be progressive, becoming worsewith time.\nResources\nBOOKS\nRosenthal, Odeda, and Robert H. Phillips. Coping with Color\nBlindness.

    "title": "Colostomy",
    "content": "Colostomy\nDefinition\nOstomy is a surgical procedure used to create an\nopening for urine and feces to be released from the body.Colostomy refers to a surgical procedure where a portionof the large intestine is brought through the abdominalwall to carry stool out of the body.\nPurpose\nA colostomy is created as a means to treat various\ndisorders of the large intestine, including cancer , obstruc-\ntion, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured diverticulum,ischemia (compromised blood supply), or traumatic\ninjury. Temporary colostomies are created to divert stoolfrom injured or diseased portions of the large intestine,allowing rest and healing. Permanent colostomies are per-formed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest dis-tance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable.Although colorectal cancer is the most common indica-tion for a permanent colostomy, only about 10–15% ofpatients with this diagnosis require a colostomy.\nDescription\nSurgery will result in one of three types of colos-\ntomies:\n• End colostomy. The functioning end of the intestine\n(the section of bowel that remains connected to theupper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the sur-face of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing theintestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin.A stoma is an artificial opening created to the surface ofthe body. The surface of the stoma is actually the liningof the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink. Thedistal portion of bowel (now connected only to the rec-tum) may be removed, or sutured closed and left in theabdomen. An end colostomy is usually a permanentostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another patho-logical condition.\n• Double–barrel colostomy. This colsotomy involves the\ncreation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall.The proximal (nearest) stoma is the functional end thatis connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and willdrain stool. The distal stoma, connected to the rectumand also called a mucous fistula, drains small amountsof mucus material. This is most often a temporarycolostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to belater closed.\n• Loop colostomy. This colostomy is created by bringing\na loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominalwall. The loop is held in place outside the abdomen bya plastic rod slipped beneath it. An incision is made inthe bowel to allow the passage of stool through the loopcolostomy. The supporting rod is removed approxi-mately 7-10 days after surgery, when healing hasoccurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 861ColostomyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 861retracting into the abdomen. A loop colostomy is most\noften performed for creation of a temporary stoma todivert stool away from an area of intestine that has beenblocked or ruptured.\nPreparation\nAs with any surgical procedure, the patient will be\nrequired to sign a consent form after the procedure isexplained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, alongwith various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG),may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi-ble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist,who will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen forthe stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomymanagement.\nIn order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient\nmay be placed on a low residue diet for several days priorto surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least theday before surgery, with nothing by mouth after mid-night. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations\n(GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowelof stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin,\nor kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte-ria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec-tion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to thestomach on the day of surgery or during surgery toremove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom-\niting . A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be\ninserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, givingmore space in the surgical field and decreasing chancesof accidental injury.\nAftercare\nPost-operative care for the patient with a new colos-\ntomy, as with those who have had any major surgery,involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations,and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow becauseof the effect of anesthesia and the patient’s reluctance tobreathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the\nabdominal incision. The patient is instructed how to sup-port the operative site during deep breathing and cough-ing, and given pain medication as necessary. Fluid intakeand output is measured, and the operative site is observed\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 862Colostomy\nClosed incision\nCatheter\nColostomy bagColon\nGlass rod\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure in which a portion of the large intestine, or colon, is brought through the abdominal wall\nto carry feces out of the body.There are three types of colostomies: end colostomy, double-barrel colostomy, and loopcolostomy.The loop colostomy is featured in the illustration above. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 862for color and amount of wound drainage. The nasogastric\ntube will remain in place, attached to low intermittentsuction until bowel activity resumes. For the first 24–48hours after surgery, the colostomy will drain bloodymucus. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenouslyuntil the patient’s diet is can gradually be resumed, begin-ning with liquids. Usually within 72 hours, passage of gasand stool through the stoma begins. Initially the stool isliquid, gradually thickening as the patient begins to takesolid foods. The patient is usually out of bed in 8–24hours after surgery and discharged in 2–4 days.\nA colostomy pouch will generally have been placed\non the patient’s abdomen, around the stoma, duringsurgery. During the hospital stay, the patient and his orher caregivers will be educated on how to care for thecolostomy. Determination of appropriate pouching sup-plies and a schedule of how often to change the pouchshould be established. Regular assessment and meticu-lous care of the skin surrounding the stoma is importantto maintain an adequate surface on which to apply thepouch. Some patients with colostomies are able to rou-tinely irrigate the stoma, resulting in regulation of bowelfunction; rather than needing to wear a pouch, thesepatients may need only a dressing or cap over theirstoma. Often, an enterostomal therapist will visit thepatient at home after discharge to help with the patient’sresumption of normal daily activities.\nRisks\nPotential complications of colostomy surgery include:\n• excessive bleeding\n• surgical wound infection• thrombophlebitis (inflammation and blood clot to veins\nin the legs)\n• pneumonia\n• pulmonary embolism (blood clot or air bubble in the\nlungs’ blood supply)\nNormal results\nComplete healing is expected without complica-\ntions. The period of time required for recovery from thesurgery may vary depending of the patient’s overallhealth prior to surgery. The colostomy patient withoutother medical complications should be able to resume alldaily activities once recovered from the surgery.\nAbnormal results\nThe doctor should be made aware of any of the fol-\nlowing problems after surgery:\n• increased pain, swelling, redness, drainage, or bleeding\nin the surgical areaKEY TERMS\nDiverticulum —Pouches that project off the wall of\nthe intestine, visible as opaque on an x ray after thepatient has swallowed a contrast (dye) substance.\nEmbolism —Blockage of a blood vessel by any\nsmall piece of material traveling in the blood. Theemboli may be caused by germs, air, blood clots,or fat.\nEnema —Insertion of a tube into the rectum to\ninfuse fluid into the bowel and encourage a bowelmovement. Ordinary enemas contain tap water,mixtures of soap and water, glycerine and water,or other materials.\nIntestine —Commonly called the bowels, divided\ninto the small and large intestine. They extendfrom the stomach to the anus. The small intestineis about 20 ft (6 m) long. The large intestine isabout 5 ft (1.5 m) long.\nIschemia —A compromise in blood supply deliv-\nered to body tissues that causes tissue damage ordeath.\nOstomy —A surgically created opening in the\nabdomen for elimination of waste products (urineor stool).\n• headache, muscle aches, dizziness, or fever\n• increased abdominal pain or swelling, constipation ,\nnausea or vomiting or black, tarry stools\nStomal complications to be monitored include:\n• Death (necrosis) of stomal tissue. Caused by inade-\nquate blood supply, this complication is usually visible12–24 hours after the operation and may require addi-tional surgery.\n• Retraction (stoma is flush with the abdomen surface or\nhas moved below it). Caused by insufficient stomallength, this complication may be managed by use ofspecial pouching supplies. Elective revision of thestoma is also an option.\n• Prolapse (stoma increases length above the surface of\nthe abdomen). Most often results from an overly largeopening in the abdominal wall or inadequate fixation ofthe bowel to the abdominal wall. Surgical correction isrequired when blood supply is compromised.\n• Stenosis (narrowing at the opening of the stoma). Often\nassociated with infection around the stoma or scarring.Mild stenosis can be removed under local anesthesia.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 863ColostomyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 863A colposcopy makes it possible for a physician to view this\nhealthy cervix without surgery.

    "title": "Colposcopy",
    "content": "Colposcopy\nDefinition\nColposcopy is a procedure that allows a physician to\ntake a closer look at a woman’s cervix and vagina using aspecial instrument called a colposcope. It is used tocheck for precancerous or abnormal areas. The colpo-scope can magnify the area between 10 and 40 times;some devices also can take photographs.\nPurpose\nThe colposcope helps to identify abnormal areas of\nthe cervix or vagina so that small pieces of tissue (biop-sies) can be taken for further analysis.\nColposcopy is used to identify or rule out the exis-\ntence of any precancerous conditions in the cervical tis-sue. If a PAP test shows abnormal cell growth, further\ntesting, such as colposcopy, often is required. A PAP testis a screening test that involves scraping cells from theoutside of the cervix. If abnormal cells are found, thephysician will attempt to find the area that produced theabnormal cells and remove it for further study (biopsy).Only then can a diagnosis be made.\nColposcopy may also be performed if the cervix\nlooks abnormal during a routine examination. It may alsobe suggested for women with genital warts and for\ndiethylstilbestrol (DES) daughters (women whose moth-ers took DES when pregnant with them).\nPrecautions\nWomen who are pregnant, or who suspect that they\nare pregnant, must tell their doctor before the procedurebegins. Pregnant women can, and should, have a col-poscopy if they have an abnormal PAP test. However, spe-cial precautions must be taken during biopsy of the cervix.\nDescription\nA colposcopy is performed in a physician’s office\nand is similar to a regular gynecologic exam. An instru-ment called a speculum is used to hold the vagina open,and the gynecologist looks at the cervix and vaginathrough the colposcope instead simply by eye, as in aroutine examination.\nThe colposcope is placed outside the patient’s body\nand never touches the skin. The cervix and vagina areswabbed with dilute acetic acid (vinegar). The solutionhighlights abnormal areas by turning them white (insteadof a normal pink color). Abnormal areas can also beidentified by looking for a characteristic pattern made byabnormal blood vessels.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 864ColposcopyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 864If any abnormal areas are seen, the doctor will take a\nbiopsy of the tissue, a common procedure that takesabout 15 minutes. Several samples might be taken,depending on the size of the abnormal area. A biopsymay cause temporary discomfort and cramping, whichusually go away within a few minutes. If the abnormalarea appears to extend inside the cervical canal, a scrap-ing of the canal may be done. The biopsy results are usu-ally available within a week.\nIf the tissue sample indicates abnormal growth (dys-\nplasia) or precancer, and if the entire abnormal area canbe seen, the doctor can destroy the tissue using one ofseveral procedures, including ones that use high heat(diathermy), extreme cold (cryosurgery), or lasers.Another procedure, called a loop electrosurgical excision(LEEP), uses low-voltage high-frequency radio waves toexcise tissue. If any of the abnormal tissue is within thecervical canal, a cone biopsy (removal of a conical sec-tion of the cervix for inspection) will be needed.\nPreparation\nColposcopy is a painless procedure that does not\nrequire any anesthetic medication. If a biopsy is done,there may be mild cramps or a sharp pinching when thetissue is removed. To lessen this pain , your doctor may\nrecommend 800 mg of ibuprofen (Motrin) taken thenight before and the morning of the procedure (no laterthan 30 minutes before the appointment). Patients whoare pregnant or allergic to aspirin or ibuprofen can take\ntwo tablets of acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead.\nAftercare\nIf a biopsy was done, there may be a dark vaginal\ndischarge afterwards.

It was linked to several seriousbirth defects and disorders of the reproductive sys-tem in daughters of women who took DES. In1971, the FDA suggested it not be used duringpregnancy and banned its use in 1979 as a growthpromoter in livestock.\nDiathermy —Also called electrocautery, this is a\nprocedure that heats and destroys abnormal cells.It is gradually being replaced by cryosurgery,lasers, or LEEP.\nHuman papilloma virus —A virus that causes com-\nmon warts of the hands and feet, as well as lesionsin the genital and vaginal area. More than 50types of HPV have been identified, some of whichare linked to cancerous and precancerous condi-tions, including cancer of the cervix.\nLoop electrosurgical excision (LEEP) —A proce-\ndure that can help diagnose and treat cervicalabnormalities, using a thin wire loop that emits alow-voltage high-frequency radio wave that canexcise tissue. It is considered better than eitherlasers or electrocautery because it can both diag-nose and treat precancerous cells or early stagecancer at the same time.\nPAP test —The common term for the Papanicolaou\ntest, a simple smear method of examining stainedcells to detect cancer of the cervix.\nSpeculum —A retractor used to separate the walls\nof the vagina to make visual examination easier.\ndoctor applies Monsel’s solution to the area to stop the\nbleeding.

    "title": "Coma",
    "content": "Coma\nDefinition\nComa, from the Greek word “koma,” meaning deep\nsleep, is a state of extreme unresponsiveness, in which anindividual exhibits no voluntary movement or behavior.Furthermore, in a deep coma, even painful stimuli(actions which, when performed on a healthy individual,result in reactions) are unable to affect any response, andnormal reflexes may be lost.\nDescription\nComa lies on a spectrum with other alterations in con-\nsciousness. The level of consciousness required by, forexample, someone reading this passage lies at one extremeend of the spectrum, while complete brain death lies at the\nother end of the spectrum. In between are such states asobtundation, drowsiness, and stupor. All of these are con-ditions which, unlike coma, still allow the individual torespond to stimuli, although such a response may be briefand require stimulus of greater than normal intensity.\nIn order to understand the loss of function suffered\nby a comatose individual, it is necessary to first under-stand the important characteristics of the conscious state.Consciousness is defined by two fundamental elements:awareness and arousal.\nAwareness allows one to receive and process all the\ninformation communicated by the five senses, and thusrelate to oneself and to the outside world. Awareness hasboth psychological and physiological components. Thepsychological component is governed by an individual’smind and mental processes. The physiological compo-nent refers to the functioning of an individual’s brain,and therefore that brain’s physical and chemical condi-tion. Awareness is regulated by cortical areas within thecerebral hemispheres, the outermost layer of the brainthat separates humans from other animals by allowingfor greater intellectual functioning.\nArousal is regulated solely by physiological func-\ntioning and consists of more primitive responsiveness tothe world, as demonstrated by predictable reflex (invol-untary) responses to stimuli. Arousal is maintained bythe reticular activating system (RAS). This is not ananatomical area of the brain, but rather a network ofstructures (including the brainstem, the medulla, and thethalamus) and nerve pathways, which function togetherto produce and maintain arousal.\nCauses and symptoms\nComa, then, is the result of something that interferes\nwith the functioning of the cerebral cortex and/or thefunctioning of the structures which make up the RAS. Infact, a huge and varied number of conditions can result incoma. A good way of categorizing these conditions is toconsider the anatomic and the metabolic causes of coma.Anatomic causes of coma are those conditions that dis-rupt the normal physical architecture of the brain struc-tures responsible for consciousness, either at the level of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 866ComaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 866GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 867Coma\nStructural lesions within this region also resulting\nin compression of the brain-stem and damage tothe reticular activating substance (RAS)Lesions within the brain-stem directly suppressing\nthe reticular activating substance (RAS)Diffuse and bilateral damage to the cerebral cortex\n(relative preservation of brain-stem reflexes)Mass lesions in this region resulting in\ncompression of the brain-stem and damageto the reticular activating substance (RAS)\nBrain-stem\ncompression\nAsymmetrical brain-stem signsLocal brain-stempressure\nSymmetrical\ndepression ofbrain-stem reflexesPossible causes\n• Damage due to lack of oxygen or restricted blood flow, perhaps   resulting from cardiac arrest, an anaesthetic accident, or shock• Damage incurred from metabolic processes associated with   kidney or liver failure, or with hypoglycemia• Trauma damage• Damage due to a bout with meningitis, encephalomyelitis, or a   severe systemic infection\nPossible causes   • Cerebellar tumors, abscesses, or hemorrhages Possible causes   • Drug overdosageCortex\nMid-brain reticular\nformation\nA side-view of the brain, showing movement\nof the reticular activating substance (RAS)essential to consciousnessThalamus\nThe four brain conditions that result in coma.

Drugs or alcohol in toxic quan-tities can result in neuronal dysfunction, as can sub-stances normally found in the body, but that, due tosome diseased state, accumulate at toxic levels. Accu-mulated substances that might cause coma includeammonia due to liver disease, ketones due to uncon-trolled diabetes, or carbon dioxide due to a severe asth-\nmaattack.\n• The changes in chemical levels in the brain due to the\nelectrical derangements caused by seizures.\nDiagnosis\nAs in any neurologic condition, history and exami-\nnation form the cornerstone of diagnosis when thepatient is in a coma; however, history must be obtainedfrom family, friends, or EMS. The Glasgow Coma Scaleis a system of examining a comatose patient. It is helpfulfor evaluating the depth of the coma, tracking thepatient’s progress, and predicting (somewhat) the ulti-KEY TERMS\nAnatomic —Related to the physical structure of an\norgan or organism.\nMetabolic —Refers to the chemical processes of an\norgan or organism.\nNeuron —The cells within the body which make\nup the nervous system, specifically those alongwhich information travels.\nPhysiological —Pertaining to the functioning of an\norgan, as governed by the interactions between itsphysical and chemical conditions.\nPsychological —Pertaining to the mind, its mental\nprocesses, and its emotional makeup.\nStimulus/stimuli —Action or actions performed\non an individual which predictably provoke(s) areaction.mate outcome of the coma. The Glasgow Coma Scale\nassigns a different number of points for exam results inthree different categories: opening the eyes, verbalresponse (using words or voice to respond), and motorresponse (moving a part of the body). Fifteen is thelargest possible number of total points, indicating thehighest level of functioning. The highest level of func-tioning would be demonstrated by an individual whospontaneously opens his/her eyes, gives appropriateanswers to questions about his/her situation, and cancarry out a command (such as “move your leg” or “nodyour head”). Three is the least possible number of totalpoints and would be given to a patient for whom not evena painful stimulus is sufficient to provoke a response. Inthe middle are those patients who may be able torespond, but who require an intense or painful stimulus,and whose response may demonstrate some degree ofbrain malfunctioning (such as a person whose onlyresponse to pain in a limb is to bend that limb in toward\nthe body). When performed as part of the admissionexamination, a Glasgow score of three to five pointsoften suggests that the patient has likely suffered fatalbrain damage, while eight or more points indicates thatthe patient’s chances for recovery are good. Expansion ofthe pupils and respiratory pattern are also important.Metabolic causes of coma are diagnosed from bloodwork and urinalysis to evaluate blood chemistry, drug\nscreen, and blood cell abnormalities that may indicateinfection. Anatomic causes of coma are diagnosed fromcomputed tomography scans (CT) or magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) scans.\nTreatment\nComa is a medical emergency, and attention must\nfirst be directed to maintaining the patient’s respirationand circulation, using intubation aand ventilation, admin-istration of intravenous fluids or blood as needed, andother supportive care. If head trama has not been exclud-ed, the neck should be stablized in the event of fracture. Itis obviously extremely important for a physician to deter-mine quickly the cause of a coma, so that potentiallyreversible conditions are treated immediately. For exam-ple, an infection may be treated with antibiotics ; a brain\ntumor may be removed; and brain swelling from an\ninjury can be reduced with certain medications. Variousmetabolic disorders can be addressed by supplying theindividual with the correct amount of oxygen, glucose, orsodium; by treating the underlying disease in liver dis-ease, asthma, or diabetes; and by halting seizures withmedication. Because of their low incidence of side effectsand potential for prompt reversal of coma in certain con-ditions, glucose, the B-vitamin thiamine, and Narcan (tocounteract any narcotic-type drugs) are routinely given.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 868ComaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 868Prognosis\nSome conditions that cause coma can be completely\nreversed, restoring the individual to his or her originallevel of functioning. However, if areas of the brain havebeen sufficiently damaged due to the severity or durationof the condition which led to the coma, the individualmay recover from the coma with permanent disabilities,or may even never regain consciousness. Take, for exam-ple, the situation of someone whose coma was caused bybrain injury in a car accident. Such an injury can result inone of three outcomes. In the event of a less severe braininjury, with minimal swelling, an individual may indeedrecover consciousness and regain all of his or her originalabilities. In the event of a more severe brain injury, withswelling that resulted in further pressure on areas of thebrain, an individual may regain consciousness, but mayhave some degree of impairment. The impairment maybe physical (such as paralysis of a leg) or may even\nresult in a change in the individual’s intellectual func-tioning and/or personality. The most severe types ofbrain injury, short of death, result in states in which theindividual loses all ability to function and remains deeplyunresponsive. An individual who has suffered such asevere brain injury may remain in a coma indefinitely.This condition is termed persistent vegetative state .\nOutcome from a coma is therefore quite variable and\ndepends a great deal on the cause and duration of the coma.In the case of drug poisonings, extremely high rates ofrecovery can be expected following prompt medical atten-tion. Patients who have suffered head injuries tend to dobetter than do patients whose coma was caused by othertypes of medical illnesses.

    "title": "Common cold",
    "content": "Common cold\nDefinition\nThe common cold is a viral infection of the upper\nrespiratory system, including the nose, throat, sinuses,eustachian tubes, trachea, larynx, and bronchial tubes.Although over 200 different viruses can cause a cold,30–50% are caused by a group known as rhinoviruses.Almost all colds clear up in less than two weeks withoutcomplications.\nDescription\nColds, sometimes called rhinovirus or coronavirus\ninfections, are the most common illness to strike any partof the body. It is estimated that the average person hasmore than 50 colds during a lifetime. Anyone can get acold, although pre-school and grade school childrencatch them more frequently than adolescents and adults.Repeated exposure to viruses causing colds creates par-tial immunity.\nAlthough most colds resolve on their own without\ncomplications, they are a leading cause of visits to thedoctor and of time lost from work and school. Treatingsymptoms of the common cold has given rise to a multi-million dollar industry in over-the-counter medications.\nCold season in the United States begins in early\nautumn and extends through early spring. Although it isnot true that getting wet or being in a draft causes a cold(a person has to come in contact with the virus to catch acold), certain conditions may lead to increased suscepti-bility. These include:\n• fatigue and overwork• emotional stress\n• poor nutrition\n•smoking\n• living or working in crowded conditions\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 869Common coldGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 869Colds make the upper respiratory system less resis-\ntant to bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial infectionmay lead to middle ear infection, bronchitis ,pneumo-\nnia, sinus infection, or strep throat . People with chronic\nlung disease, asthma , diabetes, or a weakened immune\nsystem are more likely to develop these complications.\nCauses and symptoms\nColds are caused by more than 200 different viruses.\nThe most common groups are rhinoviruses and coron-aviruses. Different groups of viruses are more infectiousat different seasons of the year, but knowing the exactvirus causing the cold is not important in treatment.\nPeople with colds are contagious during the first two\nto four days of the infection. Colds pass from person toperson in several ways. When an infected person coughs,sneezes, or speaks, tiny fluid droplets containing the virusare expelled. If these are breathed in by other people, thevirus may establish itself in their noses and airways.\nColds may also be passed through direct contact. If a\nperson with a cold touches his runny nose or watery eyes,then shakes hands with another person some of the virus istransferred to the uninfected person. If that person thentouches his mouth, nose, or eyes, the virus is transferred toan environment where it can reproduce and cause a cold.\nFinally, cold viruses can be spread through inani-\nmate objects (door knobs, telephones, toys) that becomecontaminated with the virus. This is a common methodof transmission in child care centers. If a child with acold touches his runny nose, then plays with a toy, someof the virus may be transferred to the toy. When anotherchild plays with the toy a short time later, he may pick upsome of the virus on his hands. The second child thentouches his contaminated hands to his eyes, nose, ormouth and transfers some of the cold virus to himself.\nOnce acquired, the cold virus attaches itself to the\nlining of the nasal passages and sinuses. This causes theinfected cells to release a chemical called histamine. His-tamine increases the blood flow to the infected cells,causing swelling, congestion, and increased mucus pro-duction. Within one to three days the infected personbegins to show cold symptoms.\nThe first cold symptoms are a tickle in the throat,\nrunny nose, and sneezing. The initial discharge from thenose is clear and thin. Later it changes to a thick yellowor greenish discharge. Most adults do not develop a fever\nwhen they catch a cold. Young children may develop alow fever of up to 102°F (38.9°C).\nIn addition to a runny nose and fever, signs of a cold\ninclude coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion, headache ,\nmuscle ache, chills, sore throat , hoarseness, wateryeyes, tiredness, and lack of appetite. The cough that\naccompanies a cold is usually intermittent and dry.\nMost people begin to feel better four to five days\nafter their cold symptoms become noticeable. All symp-toms are generally gone within ten days, except for a drycough that may linger for up to three weeks.\nColds make people more susceptible to bacterial\ninfections such as strep throat, middle ear infections, andsinus infections. A person whose cold does not begin toimprove within a week; or who experiences chest pain ,\nfever for more than a few days, difficulty breathing,bluish lips or fingernails, a cough that brings up green-ish-yellow or grayish sputum, skin rash, swollen glands,or whitish spots on the tonsils or throat should consult adoctor to see if they have acquired a secondary bacterialinfection that needs to be treated with an antibiotic.\nPeople who have emphysema , chronic lung disease,\ndiabetes, or a weakened immune system—either fromdiseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result of\nmedications, ( corticosteroids ,chemotherapy drugs)—\nshould consult their doctor if they get a cold. People withthese health problems are more likely to get a secondaryinfection.\nDiagnosis\nColds are diagnosed by observing a person’s symp-\ntoms. There are no laboratory tests readily available todetect the cold virus. However, a doctor may do a throat\nculture or blood test to rule out a secondary infection.\nInfluenza is sometimes confused with a cold, but flu\ncauses much more severe symptoms and generally afever. Allergies to molds or pollens also can make the\nnose run. Allergies are usually more persistent than thecommon cold. An allergist can do tests to determine ifthe cold-like symptoms are being caused by an allergicreaction. Also, some people get a runny nose when theygo outside in winter and breathe cold air. This type ofrunny nose is not a symptom of a cold.\nTreatment\nThere are no medicines that will cure the common\ncold. Given time, the body’s immune system will makeantibodies to fight the infection, and the cold will beresolved without any intervention. Antibiotics are use-\nless against a cold. However, a great deal of money isspent by pharmaceutical companies in the United Statespromoting products designed to relieve cold symptoms.These products usually contain antihistamines ,decon-\ngestants , and/or pain relievers.\nAntihistamines block the action of the chemical hist-\namine that is produced when the cold virus invades the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 870Common coldGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 870cells lining the nasal passages. Histamine increases\nblood flow and causes the cells to swell. Antihistaminesare taken to relieve the symptoms of sneezing, runnynose, itchy eyes, and congestion. Side effects are dry\nmouth and drowsiness, especially with the first few\ndoses. Antihistamines should not be taken by people whoare driving or operating dangerous equipment. Somepeople have allergic reactions to antihistamines. Com-mon over-the-counter antihistamines include Chlor-Trimeton, Dimetapp, Tavist, and Actifed. The genericname for two common antihistamines are chlorpheni-ramine and diphenhydramine.\nDecongestants work to constrict the blood flow to\nthe vessels in the nose. This can shrink the tissue, reducecongestion, and open inflamed nasal passages, makingbreathing easier. Decongestants can make people feel jit-tery or keep them from sleeping. They should not be usedby people with heart disease, high blood pressure, orglaucoma . Some common decongestants are Neo-\nSynepherine, Novafed, and Sudafed. The generic namesof common decongestants include phenylephrine,phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, and in nasalsprays naphazoline, oxymetazoline and xylometazoline.\nMany over the counter medications are combina-\ntions of both antihistamines and decongestants; an acheand pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Datril,\nTylenol, Panadol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin,Medipren); and a cough suppressant (dextromethor-phan). Common combination medications includeTylenol Cold and Flu, Triaminic, Sudafed Plus, andTavist D. Aspirin should not be given to children with a\ncold because of its association with a risk of Reye’s syn-\ndrome , a serious disease.\nNasal sprays and nose drops are other products pro-\nmoted for reducing nasal congestion. These usually con-tain a decongestant, but the decongestant can act morequickly and strongly than ones found in pills or liquidsbecause it is applied directly in the nose. Congestionreturns after a few hours.\nPeople can become dependent on nasal sprays and\nnose drops. If used for a long time, users may sufferwithdrawal symptoms when these products are discon-tinued. Nasal sprays and nose drops should not be usedfor more than a few days. Check the label for recommen-dations on length and frequency of use.\nPeople react differently to different cold medications\nand may find some more helpful than others. A medica-tion may be effective initially, then lose some of its effec-tiveness. Children sometimes react differently thanadults. Over-the-counter cold remedies should not begiven to infants without consulting a doctor first.Care should be taken not to exceed the recommend-\ned dosages, especially when combination medications ornasal sprays are taken. Individuals should determinewhether they wish to use any of these drugs. None ofthem shorten or cure a cold. At best they help a personfeel more comfortable. People who are confused aboutthe drugs in any over-the-counter cold remedies shouldask their pharmacist for an explanation.\nIn addition to the optional use of over the counter\ncold remedies, there are some self-care steps that peoplecan take to ease their discomfort. These include:\n• drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding acidic juices,\nwhich may irritate the throat\n• gargling with warm salt water—made by adding one\nteaspoon of salt to 8 oz of water—for a sore throat\n• not smoking\n• getting plenty of rest\n• using a cool-mist room humidifier to ease congestion\nand sore throat\n• rubbing Vaseline or other lubricant under the nose to\nprevent irritation from frequent nose blowing\n• for babies too young to blow their noses, the mucus\nshould be suctioned gently with an infant nasal aspira-tor, it may be necessary to soften the mucus first with afew drops of salt water\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative practitioners emphasize that people get\ncolds because their immune systems are weak. Theypoint out that everyone is exposed to cold viruses, but noteveryone gets every cold. The difference seems to be inthe ability of the immune system to fight infection. Pre-vention focuses on strengthening the immune system byeating a healthy diet low in sugars and high in fresh fruitsand vegetables, practicing meditation to reduce stress,\nand getting regular moderate exercise .\nOnce cold symptoms appear, some naturopathic\npractitioners believe the symptoms should be allowed to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 871Common cold\nCold Remedies\nSymptoms Side effects\nAntihistamines Congestion Drowsiness\nItchy eyes Dry mouth and eyesRunny noseSneezingStuffy nose\nDecongestants Congestion Insomnia\nStuffy nose Rapid heart beat StimulationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 871run their course without interference.

(Chinese traditional medicine)\n• The use of zinc lozenges every two hours along with\nhigh doses of vitamin C is suggested. Some practition-ers also suggest eliminating dairy products for the dura-tion of the cold. (Nutritional therapy).\nThe use of zinc lozenges may be moving toward\nacceptance by practitioners of traditional medicine. In1996 the Cleveland Clinic tested zinc gluconate lozengesand found using zinc in the first 24 hours after coldsymptoms occurred shortened the duration of symptoms.KEY TERMS\nBronchial tubes —The major airways to the lungs\nand their main branches.\nCoronavirus —a genus of viruses that cause respi-\nratory disease and gastroenteritis.\nCorticosteroids —A group of hormones produced\nnaturally by the adrenal gland or manufacturedsynthetically.

Patients with this disease are subject to recurringinfections.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 872Common variable immunodeficiencyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 872Description\nImmunodeficiency means that the immune system is\ndeficient in one or more of its components and is unableto respond effectively. Common variable immunodefi-ciency is the most common of the immunodeficiency dis-orders. Patients with this disease have frequent infec-tions, especially those caused by the same microorgan-ism. Recurring infections are an indication that theimmune system is not responding normally and develop-ing immunity to reinfection. Patients with common vari-able immunodeficiency have a normal number of B cells,the lymphocytes that make antibodies. In approximatelyone-third of these patients, the number of B cells in theblood that have IgG antibodies on their surface is lowerthan normal, but there are normal numbers of B cells intheir bone marrow. B cells with IgG antibodies on theirsurface are capable of responding to microorganisms.The lack of IgG on the surface of the B cells means thatthey are not prepared to fight infection. The T-cell lym-phocytes, those cells responsible for cellular immunity,are usually normal, although some cell signal compo-nents may be lacking.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of common variable immunodeficiency is\nnot known, although some forms seem to be hereditary.The main symptom is recurring infections that tend to bechronic rather than acute. Patients may also develop diar-\nrhea and, as a consequence of the diarrhea, do not absorb\nfood efficiently. This can lead to malnourishment that canaggravate the disorder. Common variable immunodefi-ciency normally appears in children after the age of 10.Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis ,\nthyroiditis , and systemic lupus erythematosus and cer-\ntain cancers such as lymphomas and leukemias may beassociated with common variable immunodeficiency.\nDiagnosis\nAs is true of most immunodeficiency disorders, one\nof the first signs that the patient has the condition isrecurrent infections. Patients with common variableimmunodeficiency are subject to recurrent infections,especially those caused by microbes that don’t normallycause disease in normal persons. The main diagnostictest that distinguishes common variable immunodeficien-cy from other immunodeficiency diseases is the low anti-body level despite the normal number of B cells. Anti-body levels are tested in the serum by a procedure calledelectrophoresis. This procedure both quantifies theamount of antibody present and identifies the variousclasses of antibodies. The main class of antibody forfighting infectious diseases is IgG.Treatment\nThere is no treatment that will cure the disorder.\nTreatment for common variable immunodeficiency aimsat boosting the body’s immune response and preventingor controlling infections. Immune serum, obtained fromdonated blood, is given as a source of antibodies to boostthe immune response. Immune serum is obtained fromdonated blood. It contains whatever antibodies thedonors had in their blood. Consequently, it may not con-tain all the antibodies that the patient needs and may lackantibodies specific for some of the recurring infectionsthat these patients suffer. Antibiotics are used routinely\nat the first sign of an infection to help the patient elimi-nate infectious microorganisms.\nPrognosis\nWith good medical care, people with common vari-\nable immunodeficiency usually have a normal life span.\nPrevention\nThe disease itself cannot be prevented, but patients and\ntheir families can take precautions to prevent the recurrentinfections commonly associated with it. For example, goodhygiene and nutrition are important, as is avoiding crowds\nor other people who have active infections.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAbbas, Abul K., Andrew H. Lichtman, and Jordan S.

It\ncan poke holes in bacteria, kill bacteria that are first tar-geted by antibodies, or, working with antibodies, point\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 873Complement deficienciesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 873out which bacteria need to be engulfed by white blood\ncells. Without sufficient complement, the body is proneto frequent infections, like pneumonia or meningitis ,o r\nother illnesses, including autoimmune diseases, like sys-\ntemic lupus erythematosus . Since there are more than\n20 different types of complement, the disease that resultsdepends on the specific complement that is lacking.\nCause and symptoms\nA defect in the complement system can be genetic, but\na secondary complement deficiency can also result fromailments that involve a lot of protein loss, including seriousburns , liver or kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases,\nlike lupus. Symptoms vary depending on the specific com-plement deficiency and the disease that results.

There are various types, including thosethat engulf and kill invading bacteria.ple remain healthy with no symptoms at all. Others, who\nsuffer from frequent infections, may develop a high fever ,\ndiarrhea , headaches with a stiff neck, or a cough with\nchest pain. If an autoimmune disease develops, like lupus,\nthe person may lose weight, suffer from a rash, and havejoint pain. Other symptoms of complement deficiency dis-eases (like hereditary angioedema, paroxysmal nocturnalhemoglobinuria, or leukocyte adhesion deficiency syn-drome) include abdominal and back pain, skin infections,edema or swelling of the face and red bumps on the skin.\nDiagnosis\nThere are blood tests that determine the activity of the\ncomplement system. The two most common screeningtests, CH50 and APH50, tell the physician which group ofcomplement components have a defect. More specificblood tests for the individual complement components(e.g., C3 or C4 complement) are then performed. Otherspecialized blood tests, including C1 esterase level, Hamtest, and a white blood count , may also be performed.\nTreatment\nThere is no way to treat the actual complement defi-\nciency. However, antibiotics are used to treat infections\nand vaccinations are given to reduce the risk of disease.Often, the person is vaccinated against infections thatinclude influenza , pneumonia, and meningitis. In some\ncases, (e.g., a specific disease called paroxysmal noctur-nal hemoglobinuria [PNH]), a bone marrow transplantmay be recommended.\nAlternative treatment\nThere is no alternative treatment for complement\nproblems.\nPrognosis\nSince complement deficiencies include a wide range\nof disorders, the prognoses can also vary widely.

    "title": "Computed tomography scans",
    "content": "Computed tomography scans\nDefinition\nComputed tomography (CT) scans are completed\nwith the use of a 360-degree x-ray beam and computerproduction of images. These scans allow for cross-sectional views of body organs and tissues.\nPurpose\nCT scans are used to image a wide variety of body\nstructures and internal organs. Since the 1990s, CTequipment has become more affordable and available. Insome diagnoses, CT scans have become the first imagingexam of choice. Because the computerized image is sosharp, focused, and three-dimensional, many tissues canbe better differentiated than on standard x rays. CommonCT indications include:\n• Sinus studies. The CT scan can show details of sinusi-\ntisand bone fractures . Physicians may order a CT of\nthe sinuses to provide an accurate map for surgery.\n• Brain studies. Brain scans can detect hematomas,\ntumors, and strokes. The introduction of CT scanning,especially spiral CT, has helped reduce the need for moreinvasive procedures such as cerebral angiography .\n• Body scans. CT scans of the body will often be used\nto observe abdominal organs, such as the liver, kid-neys, adrenal glands, spleen, and lymph nodes, andextremities.\n• Aorta scans. CT scans can focus on the thoracic or\nabdominal aorta to locate aneurysms and other possibleaortic diseases.\n• Chest scans. CT scans of the chest are useful in distin-\nguishing tumors and in detailing accumulation of fluidin chest infections.\nPrecautions\nPregnant women or those who could possibly be\npregnant should not have a CT scan unless the diagnosticbenefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant patients should par-ticularly avoid full body or abdominal scans. If the examis necessary for obstetrics purposes, technologists areinstructed not to repeat films if there are errors. Pregnantpatients receiving CT or any x-ray exam away from theabdominal area may be protected by a lead apron; mostradiation, known as scatter, travels through the body andis not blocked by the apron.\nContrast agents are often used in CT exams and the\nuse of these agents should be discussed with the medicalprofessional prior to the procedure. Patients should beasked to sign a consent form concerning the administra-tion of contrast. One of the common contrast agents,iodine, can cause allergic reactions. Patients who areknown to be allergic to iodine (or shellfish) shouldinform the physician prior to the CT scan.\nDescription\nComputed tomography, also called CT scan, CAT\nscan, or computerized axial tomography, is a combina-tion of focused x-ray beams and computerized produc-tion of an image. Introduced in the early 1970s, this radi-ologic procedure has advanced rapidly and is now widelyused, sometimes in the place of standard x rays.\nCT equipment\nA CT scan may be performed in a hospital or outpa-\ntient imaging center. Although the equipment looks largeand intimidating, it is very sophisticated and fairly com-fortable. The patient is asked to lie on a gantry, or narrowtable, that slides into the center of the scanner. The scan-ner looks like a doughnut and is round in the middle,which allows the x-ray beam to rotate around the patient.The scanner section may also be tilted slightly to allowfor certain cross-sectional angles.\nCT procedure\nThe patient will feel the gantry move very slightly as\nthe precise adjustments for each sectional image are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 875Computed tomography scansGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 875made. A technologist watches the procedure from a win-\ndow and views the images on a computer screen.\nIt is essential that the patient lie very still during the\nprocedure to prevent motion blurring. In some studies,such as chest CTs, the patient will be asked to hold his orher breath during image capture.\nFollowing the procedure, films of the images are\nusually printed for the radiologist and referring physicianto review. A radiologist can also interpret CT exams on aspecial computer screen. The procedure time will vary inlength depending on the area being imaged. Averagestudy times are from 30 to 60 minutes. Some patientsmay be concerned about claustrophobia, but the width ofthe “doughnut” portion of the scanner is such that manypatients can be reassured of openness.\nThe CT image\nWhile traditional x rays image organs in two dimen-\nsions, with the possibility that organs in the front of thebody are superimposed over those in the back, CT scansallow for a more three-dimensional effect. Some havecompared CT images to slices in a loaf of bread. Precisesections of the body can be located and imaged as cross-sectional views. The screen before the technologistshows a computer’s analysis of each section detected bythe x-ray beam. Thus, various densities of tissue can beeasily distinguished.\nContrast agents\nContrast agents are often used in CT exams and in\nother radiology procedures to illuminate certain detailsof anatomy which may not be easily seen. Some con-trasts are natural, such as air or water. Other times, awater-based contrast agent is administered for specificdiagnostic purposes. Barium sulfate is commonly used ingastroenterology procedures. The patient may drink this\ncontrast, or receive it in an enema. Oral and rectal con-trast are usually given when examining the abdomen orcells, and not given when scanning the brain or chest.Iodine is the most widely used intravenous contrast agentand is given through an intravenous needle.\nIf contrast agents are used in the CT exam, these will\nbe administered several minutes before the study begins.Abdominal CT patients may be asked to drink a contrastmedium. Some patients may experience a salty taste, flush-ing of the face, warmth or slight nausea, or hives from an\nintravenous contrast injection. Technologists and radiolo-gists have equipment and training to help patients throughthese minor reactions and to handle more severe reactions.Severe reactions to contrast are rare, but do occur.\nSpiral CT\nSpiral CT, also called helical CT, is a newer version\nof CT scanning which is continuous in motion andallows for three-dimensional recreation of images. Forexample, traditional CT allows the technologist to takeslices at very small and precise intervals one after theother. Spiral CT allows for a continuous flow of images,without stopping the scanner to move to the next imageslice. A major advantage of spiral CT is the ability toreconstruct images anywhere along the length of thestudy area. The procedure also speeds up the imagingprocess, meaning less time for the patient to lie still. Theability to image contrast more rapidly after it is injected,when it is at its highest level, is another advantage of spi-ral CT’s high speed.\nSome facilities will have both spiral and convention-\nal CT available. Although spiral is more advantageousfor many applications, conventional CT is still a superiorand precise method for imaging many tissues and struc-tures. The physician will evaluate which type of CTworks best for the specific exam purpose.\nPreparation\nIf a contrast medium is administered, the patient\nmay be asked to fast from about four to six hours prior tothe procedure. Patients will usually be given a gown (likea typical hospital gown) to be worn during the procedure.All metal and jewelry should be removed to avoid arti-facts on the film.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is generally required following a CT\nscan.

The site of contrast injection will be bandagedand may feel tender following the exam. Hives maydevelop later and usually do not require treatment.\nRisks\nRadiation exposure from a CT scan is similar to,\nthough higher than, that of a conventional x ray.Although this is a risk to pregnant women, the exposureto other adults is minimal and should produce no effects.Although severe contrast reactions are rare, they are arisk of many CT procedures.\nNormal results\nNormal findings on a CT exam show bone, the most\ndense tissue, as white areas. Tissues and fat will show asvarious shades of gray, and fluids will be gray or black.Air will also look black. Intravenous, oral, and rectal con-trast appear as white areas. The radiologist can determineif tissues and organs appear normal by the sensitivity ofthe gray shadows. In CT, the images that can cut througha section of tissue or organ provide three-dimensionalviewing for the radiologist and referring physician.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal results may show different characteristics\nof tissues within organs. Accumulations of blood or otherfluids where they do not belong may be detected. Radiol-ogists can differentiate among types of tumors through-out the body by viewing details of their makeup.\nSinus studies\nThe increasing availability and lowered cost of CT\nscanning has led to its increased use in sinus studies,either as a replacement for a sinus x ray or as a follow-upto an abnormal sinus radiograph. The sensitivity of CTallows for location of areas of sinus infection, particularlychronic infection. CT scans can show the extent and loca-tion of tiny fractures to the sinus and nasal bones. Foreignbodies in the sinus and nasal area are also easily detectedby CT. CT imaging of the sinuses is important in evaluat-ing trauma or disease of the sphenoid bone (the wedgeshaped bone at the base of the skull). Sinus tumors willshow as shades of gray indicating the difference in theirdensity from that of normal tissues in the area.\nBrain studies\nThe precise differences in density allowed by CT scan\ncan clearly show tumors, strokes, or lesions in the brain areaas altered densities. These lighter or darker areas on theimage may indicate a tumor or hematoma within the brain\nand skull area. Different types of tumors can be identifiedby the presence of edema , by the tissue’s density, or by\nstudying blood vessel location and activity. The speed andconvenience of CT often allows for detection of hemorrhagebefore symptoms even occur. Congenital abnormalities inchildren, such as hydrocephalus , may also be confirmed\nwith CT. Hydrocephalus is suggested by enlargement of thefluid structures called ventricles of the brain.\nBody scans\nThe body scan can identify abnormal body structures\nand organs. Throughout the body, a CT may indicatetumors or cysts, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormal collec-tions of fluids, blood or fat, and metastasis of cancer .\nTumors resulting from metastasis are different in makeupthan primary tumors, or those that originate in the loca-tion of study. Fractures or damage to soft tissues and liga-ments will be more easily seen on the sensitive imagesproduced by CT scanning, though CT is not usually donefor these. Liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or abscessed\nor fatty liver , may be observed on the body scan.\nCT of the aorta\nCT provides the ability to see and measure the thick-\nness of the aortal wall, which is very helpful in diagnos-ing aortic aneurysms. The use of contrast will help seedetails within the aorta. In addition, density can identifycalcification, and this helps differentiate between acuteand chronic problems. An abnormal CT scan may indi-cate signs of aortic clots. Aortic rupture is suggested bysigns such as a hematoma around the aorta or the escapeof blood from its cavity.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 877Computed tomography scans\nComputerized CT scan of facial sinuses.

    "title": "Concussion",
    "content": "Concussion\nDefinition\nConcussion is a trauma-induced change in mental\nstatus, with confusion and amnesia , and with or without\na brief loss of consciousness.\nDescription\nA concussion occurs when the head hits or is hit by\nan object, or when the brain is jarred against the skull,with sufficient force to cause temporary loss of functionin the higher centers of the brain. The injured person mayremain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and isdisoriented for some minutes after the blow. Accordingto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,approximately 300,000 people sustain mild to moderatesports-related brain injuries each year, most of themyoung men between 16 and 25.\nWhile concussion usually resolves on its own with-\nout lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much moreserious condition. “Second impact syndrome” occurswhen a person with a concussion, even a very mild one,suffers a second blow before fully recovering from thefirst. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pres-sure that can result is potentially fatal. More than 20 suchcases have been reported since the syndrome was firstdescribed in 1984.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nMost concussions are caused by motor vehicle acci-\ndents and sports injuries . In motor vehicle accidents,\nconcussion can occur without an actual blow to the head.Instead, concussion occurs because the skull suddenlydecelerates or stops, which causes the brain to be jarredagainst the skull. Contact sports, especially football,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 878ConcussionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 878hockey, and boxing, are among those most likely to lead\nto concussion. Other significant causes include falls, col-lisions, or blows due to bicycling, horseback riding, ski-ing, and soccer.\nThe risk of concussion from football is extremely\nhigh, especially at the high school level. Studies showthat approximately one in five players suffer concussionor more serious brain injury during their brief high-school careers. The rate at the collegiate level is approxi-mately 1 in 20. Rates for hockey players are not knownas certainly, but are believed to be similar.\nConcussion and lasting brain damage is an especial-\nly significant risk for boxers, since the goal of the sportis, in fact, to deliver a concussion to the opponent. Forthis reason, the American Academy of Neurology hascalled for a ban on boxing. Repeated concussions overmonths or years can cause cumulative head injury . The\ncumulative brain injuries suffered by most boxers canlead to permanent brain damage. Multiple blows to thehead can cause “punch-drunk” syndrome or dementia\npugilistica, as evidenced by Muhammed Ali, whoseparkinsonism is a result of his career in the ring.\nYoung children are likely to suffer concussions from\nfalls or collisions on the playground or around the home.Child abuse is, unfortunately, another common cause of\nconcussion.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of concussion include:\n• headache\n• disorientation as to time, date, or place• confusion\n• dizziness\n• vacant stare or confused expression• incoherent or incomprehensible speech\n• incoordination or weakness\n• amnesia for the events immediately preceding the blow\n• nausea or vomiting\n• double vision• ringing in the ears\nThese symptoms may last from several minutes to\nseveral hours. More severe or longer-lasting symptomsmay indicate more severe brain injury. The person with aconcussion may or may not lose consciousness from theblow; if so, it will be for several minutes at the most.More prolonged unconsciousness indicates more severebrain injury.\nThe severity of concussion is graded on a three-point\nscale, used as a basis for treatment decisions.KEY TERMS\nAmnesia —A loss of memory that may be caused\nby brain injury, such as concussion.\nParkinsonism —A neurological disorder that\nincludes a fine tremor, muscular weakness andrigidity, and an altered way of walking.\n• Grade 1: no loss of consciousness, transient confusion,\nand other symptoms that resolve within 15 minutes.\n• Grade 2: no loss of consciousness, transient confusion,\nand other symptoms that require more than 15 minutesto resolve.\n• Grade 3: loss of consciousness for any period.\nDays or weeks after the accident, the person may\nshow signs of:\n• headache\n• poor attention and concentration\n• memory difficulties\n• anxiety• depression• sleep disturbances• light and noise intolerance\nThe occurrence of such symptoms is called “post-\nconcussion syndrome.”\nDiagnosis\nIt is very important for those attending a person with\nconcussion to pay close attention to the person’s symp-toms and progression immediately after the accident. Theduration of unconsciousness and degree of confusion arevery important indicators of the severity of the injury andhelp guide the diagnostic process and treatment decisions.\nA doctor, nurse, or emergency medical technician\nmay make an immediate assessment based on the severi-ty of the symptoms; a neurologic exam of the pupils,\ncoordination, and sensation; and brief tests of orienta-tion, memory, and concentration. Those with very mildconcussions may not need to be hospitalized or haveexpensive diagnostic tests. Questionable or more severecases may require computed tomography scan (CT) or\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for\nbrain injury.\nTreatment\nThe symptoms of concussion usually clear quickly\nand without lasting effect, if no further injury is sus-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 879ConcussionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 879tained during the healing process. Guidelines for return-\ning to sports activities are based on the severity of theconcussion.\nA grade 1 concussion can usually be treated with\nrest and continued observation alone. The person mayreturn to sports activities that same day, but only afterexamination by a trained professional, and after allsymptoms have completely resolved. If the person sus-tains a second concussion of any severity that same day,he or she should not be allowed to continue contactsports until he or she has been symptom-free, duringboth rest and activity, for one week.\nA person with a grade 2 concussion must discontin-\nue sports activity for the day, should be evaluated by atrained professional, and should be observed closelythroughout the day to make sure that all symptoms havecompletely cleared. Worsening of symptoms, or continu-ation of any symptoms beyond one week, indicates theneed for a CT or MRI scan. Return to contact sportsshould only occur after one week with no symptoms,both at rest and during activity, and following examina-tion by a physician. Following a second grade 2 concus-sion, the person should remain symptom-free for twoweeks before resuming contact sports.\nA person with a grade 3 concussion (involving any\nloss of consciousness, no matter how brief) should beexamined by a medical professional either on the scene orin an emergency room. More severe symptoms may war-rant a CT or MRI scan, along with a thorough neurologicaland physical exam. The person should be hospitalized ifany abnormalities are found or if confusion persists. Pro-longed unconsciousness and worsening symptoms requireurgent neurosurgical evaluation or transfer to a trauma cen-ter. Following discharge from professional care, the patientis closely monitored for neurological symptoms which mayarise or worsen. If headaches or other symptoms worsen orlast longer than one week, a CT or MRI scan should be per-formed. Contact sports are avoided for one week followingunconsciousness of only seconds, and for two weeks forunconsciousness of a minute or more. A person receiving asecond grade 3 concussion should avoid contact sports forat least a month after all symptoms have cleared, and thenonly with the approval of a physician. If signs of brainswelling or bleeding are seen on a CT or MRI scan, the ath-lete should not return to the sport for the rest of the season,or even indefinitely.\nFor someone who has sustained a concussion of any\nseverity, it is critically important that he or she avoid thepossibility of another blow to the head until well after allsymptoms have cleared to prevent second-impact syn-drome. The guidelines above are designed to minimizethe risk of this syndrome.Prognosis\nConcussion usually leaves no lasting neurological\nproblems. Nonetheless, symptoms of post-concussion\nsyndrome may last for weeks or even months.\nStudies of concussion in contact sports have shown\nthat the risk of sustaining a second concussion is evengreater than it was for the first if the person continues toengage in the sport.\nPrevention\nMany cases of concussion can be prevented by using\nappropriate protective equipment. This includes seatbelts and air bags in automobiles, and helmets in all con-tact sports. Helmets should also be worn when bicycling,skiing, or horseback riding. Soccer players should avoidheading the ball when it is kicked at high velocity fromclose range. Playground equipment should be underlaidwith soft material, either sand or special matting.\nThe value of high-contact sports such as boxing,\nfootball, or hockey should be weighed against the highrisk of brain injury during a young person’s participationin the sport. Steering a child’s general enthusiasm forsports into activities less apt to produce head impactsmay reduce the likelihood of brain injury.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEvans, R. Neurology and Trauma. W. B.

    "content": "Condom\nDefinition\nMale condoms are thin sheaths of latex (rubber),\npolyurethane (plastic), or animal tissue that are rolled ontoan erect penis immediately prior to intercourse. They arecommonly called “safes” or “rubbers.” Female condomsare made of polyurethane and are inserted into the vaginal\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 880CondomGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 880canal before sexual relations. The open end covers the out-\nside of the vagina, and the closed ring fits over the cervix(opening into the uterus). Both types of condoms collectthe male semen at ejaculation, acting as a barrier to fertil-ization. Condoms also perform as barriers to the exchangeof bodily fluids and are subsequently an important tool inthe prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\nPurpose\nBoth male and female condoms are used to prevent\npregnancy and to protect against STDs such as human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), gonorrhea , chlamydia,\nand syphilis . To accomplish these goals, the condom\nmust be applied and removed correctly.\nPrecautions\nMale and female condoms should not be used togeth-\ner as there is a risk that one of them may come off. Themale condom should not be snug on the tip of the penis. A\nspace of about 0.5 in should be left at the end to avoid thepossibility of it breaking during sexual intercourse. Thepenis must be withdrawn quickly after ejaculation to pre-vent the condom from falling off as the penis softens. Thecondom should therefore always be removed while thepenis is still erect to prevent the sperm from spilling intothe vagina.\nDescription\nMale condoms made from animal tissue and linen\nhave been in use for centuries. Latex condoms wereintroduced in the late 1800s and gained immediate pop-ularity because they were inexpensive and effective. Atthat time, they were primarily used to protect againstSTDs. A common complaint made by many consumersis that condoms reduce penis sensitivity and impairorgasm. Both men and women may develop allergies to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 881Condom\nPenis\nCondom\nA condom is most effective when it is placed on the penis correctly without trapping air between the penis and the condom.\n(Illustration by Argosy, Inc.)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 881the latex. Consumer interest in female condoms has\nbeen slight.\nMale condoms may be purchased lubricated, ribbed,\nor treated with spermicide (a chemical that kills sperm).To be effective, condoms must be removed carefully soas not to “spill” the contents into the vaginal canal. Con-doms that leak or break do not provide protection againstpregnancy or disease.\nIf used correctly, male condoms have an effective-\nness rate of about 90% for preventing pregnancy, butthis rate can be increased to about 99% if used with aspermicide. (Several types of spermicides are available;they can be purchased in the form of contraceptivecreams and jellies, foams, or films.) Benefits associatedwith this type of contraceptive device include easy avail-ability (no prescription is required), convenience of use,and lack of serious side effects. The primary disadvan-tage is that sexual activity must be interrupted in orderto put the condom on.\nFemale condoms, when used correctly and at every\ninstance of intercourse, were shown to prevent pregnancyin over 95% of women surveyed over the course of sixmonths. When used inconsistently, the female condomwas shown to have a failure rate of 21% in the samestudy. One benefit of the female condom is that it may beinserted immediately before sexual intercourse or up toeight hours prior, so that sexual activity does not need tobe interrupted for its insertion. One study performed by amanufacturer of the female condom indicated that50–75% of couples in numerous countries found the bar-rier acceptable for use.\nCondoms provide better protection against STDs\nthan any other contraceptive method.

A similar 1993 studyshowed that out of 171 couples with one HIV-positivepartner, all but two individuals were protected againstHIV transmission with condom use.

A measure of protection is also provided against\nhepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus (HPV),\nand herpes simplex virus (HSV).\nBefore purchasing a condom, check the expiration\ndate. Prior to use, examine the condom for holes. If alubricant is going to be used, it should be water solu-ble because petroleum jellies, such as Vaseline, andother oil based lubricants can weaken latex.

    "content": "Conduct disorder\nDefinition\nConduct disorder (CD) is a behavioral and emotion-\nal disorder of childhood and adolescence. Children withconduct disorder act inappropriately, infringe on therights of others, and violate the behavioral expectationsof others.\nDescription\nCD is present in approximately 9% of boys and\n2–9% of girls under the age of 18. Children with con-duct disorder act out aggressively and express angerinappropriately. They engage in a variety of antisocialand destructive acts, including violence towards peopleand animals, destruction of property, lying, stealing,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 882Conduct disorderGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 882truancy, and running away from home. They often\nbegin using and abusing drugs and alcohol, and havingsex at an early age. Irritability, temper tantrums, andlow self-esteem are common personality traits of chil-dren with CD.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are two sub-types of CD, one beginning in\nchildhood and the other in adolescence. There is noknown cause. Researchers and physicians suggest thatthis disease may be caused by the following:\n• poor parent-child relationships• dysfunctional families• drug abuse• physical abuse• poor relationships with other children• cognitive problems leading to school failures• brain damage• biological defects\nDifficulty in school is an early sign of potential con-\nduct disorder problems. While the patient’s IQ tends tobe in the normal range, they can have trouble with verbaland abstract reasoning skills and may lag behind theirclassmates, and consequently, feel as if they don’t “fitin.” The frustration and loss of self-esteem resulting fromthis academic and social inadequacy can trigger thedevelopment of CD.\nA dysfunctional home environment can be another\nmajor contributor to CD. An emotionally, physically, orsexually abusive home environment, a family history ofantisocial personality disorder, or parental substanceabuse can damage a child’s perceptions of himself andput him on a path toward negative behavior. Other lessobvious environmental factors can also play a part in thedevelopment of conduct disorder. Long-term studieshave shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy\nmay be linked to the development of CD in boys. Ani-mal and human studies point out that nicotine can haveundesirable effects on babies. These include alteredstructure and function of their nervous systems, learningdeficits, and behavioral problems. In a study of 177 boysages seven-12 years, those with mothers who smokedover one half a package of cigarettes daily while preg-nant were more apt to have a CD than those with moth-ers who did not smoke.\nOther conditions that may cause or co-exist with CD\ninclude head injury , substance abuse disorder, major\ndepressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder ( ADHD ). Thirty to fifty percent of childrendiagnosed with ADHD, a disorder characterized by a\npersistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity, alsohave CD.\nCD is defined as a repetitive behavioral pattern of\nviolating the rights of others or societal norms. Three ofthe following criteria, or symptoms, are required over theprevious 12 months for a diagnosis of CD (one of thethree must have occurred in the past six months):\n• bullies, threatens, or intimidates others\n• picks fights\n• has used a dangerous weapon\n• has been physically cruel to people\n• has been physically cruel to animals\n• has stolen while confronting a victim (for example,\nmugging or extortion)\n• has forced someone into sexual activity\n• has deliberately set a fire with the intention of causing\ndamage\n• has deliberately destroyed property of others\n• has broken into someone else’s house or car\n• frequently lies to get something or to avoid obligations\n• has stolen without confronting a victim or breaking and\nentering (e.g., shoplifting or forgery)\n• stays out at night; breaks curfew (beginning before 13\nyears of age)\n• has run away from home overnight at least twice (or\nonce for a lengthy period)\n• is often truant from school (beginning before 13 years\nof age).\nDiagnosis\nCD is diagnosed and treated by a number of social\nworkers, school counselors, psychiatrists, and psycholo-gists. Genuine diagnosis may require psychiatric exper-tise to rule out such conditions as bipolar disorder or\nADHD. A comprehensive evaluation of the child shouldideally include interviews with the child and parents, afull social and medical history, a cognitive evaluation,and a psychiatric exam. One or more clinical inventoriesor scales may be used to assess the child for conduct dis-order—including the Youth Self-Report, the OvertAggression Scale (OAS), Behavioral Assessment Sys-tem for Children (BASC), Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL), and Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil-dren (DISC). The tests are verbal and/or written and areadministered in both hospital and outpatient settings.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 883Conduct disorderGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 883Treatment\nTreating conduct disorder requires an approach that\naddresses both the child and his environment. Behavioraltherapy and psychotherapy can help a child with CD tocontrol his anger and develop new coping skills. Familygroup therapy may also be effective in some cases. Par-\nents should be counseled on how to set appropriate limitswith their child and be consistent and realistic when dis-ciplining. If an abusive home life is at the root of the con-duct problem, every effort should be made to move thechild into a more supportive environment. Parent trainingprograms are increasing in number.\nFor children with coexisting ADHD, substance\nabuse, depression, or learning disorders , treating these\nconditions first is preferred, and may result in a signifi-cant improvement to the CD condition. In all cases ofCD, treatment should begin when symptoms first appear.Recent studies have shown Ritalin to be a useful drug forboth ADHD and CD.\nWhen aggressive behavior is severe, mood stabi-\nlizing medication, including lithium (Cibalith-S,Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid, Lithonate, Lithotabs), car-bamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), and propranolol(Inderal), may be an appropriate option for treating theaggressive symptoms. However, placing the child intoa structured setting or treatment program such as a psy-chiatric hospital may be just as beneficial for easingaggression as medication.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for children with CD is not bright.\nFollow-up studies of conduct disordered children haveshown a high incidence of antisocial personality disor-der, affective illnesses, and chronic criminal behaviorlater in life. However, proper treatment of co-existingdisorders, early identification and intervention, andlong-term support may improve the outlook signifi-cantly.KEY TERMS\nADHD —Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; a\ndisorder characterized by a persistent pattern ofinattention and/or hyperactivity.\nMajor depressive disorder —A mood disorder\ncharacterized by profound feelings of sadness ordespair.Prevention\nA supportive, nurturing, and structured home envi-\nronment is believed to be the best defense against CD.Children with learning disabilities and/or difficulties inschool should get immediate and appropriate academicassistance.

Becausecortisol production is impeded, the adrenal gland insteadoverproduces androgens (male steroid hormones).Females with CAH are born with an enlarged clitoris andnormal internal reproductive tract structures. Males havenormal genitals at birth. CAH causes abnormal growthfor both sexes; patients will be tall as children and shortas adults. Females develop male characteristics, andmales experience premature sexual development.\nIn its most severe form, called salt-wasting CAH, a\nlife-threatening adrenal crisis can occur if the disorderis untreated. Adrenal crisis can cause dehydration ,\nshock , and death within 14 days of birth. There is also\na mild form of CAH that occurs later in childhood oryoung adult life in which patients have partial enzymedeficiency.\nCAH, a genetic disorder, is the most common adren-\nal gland disorder in infants and children, occurring in onein 10,000 total births worldwide. It affects both femalesand males. It is also called adrenogenital syndrome.\nCauses and symptoms\nCAH is an inherited disorder. It is a recessive dis-\nease, which means that a child must inherit one copy ofthe defective gene from each parent who is a carrier;when two carriers have children, each pregnancy carries\na 25% risk of producing an affected child.\nIn females, CAH produces an enlarged clitoris at\nbirth and masculinization of features as the child grows,such as deepening of the voice, facial hair, and failure tomenstruate or abnormal periods at puberty . Females\nwith severe CAH may be mistaken for males at birth. Inmales, the genitals are normal at birth, but the childbecomes muscular, the penis enlarges, pubic hairappears, and the voice deepens long before normalpuberty, sometimes as early as two to three years of age.\nIn the severe salt-wasting form of CAH, newborns\nmay develop symptoms shortly after birth, includingvomiting, dehydration, electrolyte (a compound such assodium or calcium that separates to form ions when dis-solved in water) changes, and cardiac arrhythmia.\nIn the mild form of CAH, which occurs in late child-\nhood or early adulthood, symptoms include prematuredevelopment of pubic hair, irregular menstrual periods,unwanted body hair, or severe acne . However, some-\ntimes there are no symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nCAH is diagnosed by a careful examination of the\ngenitals and blood and urine tests that measure the hor-mones produced by the adrenal gland. A number ofstates in the United States perform a hormonal test (aheel prick blood test) for CAH and other inherited dis-eases within a few days of birth. In questionable cases,genetic testing can provide a definitive diagnosis. For\nsome forms of CAH, prenatal diagnosis is possiblethrough chronic villus sampling in the first trimester andby measuring certain hormones in the amniotic fluidduring the second trimester.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment for CAH is to return the\nandrogen levels to normal. This is usually accomplishedthrough drug therapy, although surgery is an alternative.Lifelong treatment is required.\nDrug therapy consists of a cortisol-like steroid med-\nication called a glucocorticoid. Oral hydrocortisone isprescribed for children, and prednisone or dexametha-sone is prescribed for older patients. For patients withsalt-wasting CAH, fludrocortisone, which acts likealdosterone (the missing hormone), is also prescribed.Infants and small children may also receive salt tablets,while older patients are told to eat salty foods. Medicaltherapy achieves hormonal balance most of the time, butCAH patients can have periods of fluctuating hormonalcontrol that lead to increases in the dose of steroids pre-scribed. Side effects of steroids include stunted growth.Steroid therapy should not be suddenly stopped, sinceadrenal insufficiency results.\nPatients with CAH should see a pediatric endocrinol-\nogist frequently. The endocrinologist will assess height,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 885Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\nAdrenal cortical hyperplasia.The adrenal on the right is nor-\nmal, that on the left shows hyperplasia.

CAH patients with the milder form of thedisorder are usually effectively treated with hydrocorti-sone or prednisone, if they need medical treatment at all.\nFemales with CAH who have masculine external\ngenitalia require surgery to reconstruct the clitoris and/orvagina. This is usually performed between the ages ofone and three.\nAn experimental type of drug therapy—a three-drug\ncombination, with an androgen blocking agent (flu-tamide), an aromatase inhibitor (testolactone), and lowdose hydrocortisone—is currently being studied byphysicians at the National Institutes of Health. Prelimi-nary results are encouraging, but it will be many yearsbefore the safety and effectiveness of this therapy isfully known.\nAdrenalectomy , a surgical procedure to remove the\nadrenal glands, is a more radical treatment for CAH. Itwas widely used before the advent of steroids. Today, it isrecommended for CAH patients with little or no enzymeactivity and can be accomplished by laparoscopy .

Thistherapy is started in the first trimester when fetal adrenalproduction of androgens begins, but before prenatal diag-nosis is done that would provide definitive informationabout the sex of the fetus and its disease status. Thismeans that a number of fetuses are exposed to unneces-sary steroid treatment in order to prevent the develop-ment of male-like genitals in female fetuses with CAH.Several hundred children have undergone this treatmentwith no major adverse effects, but its long-term risks areunknown.

    "title": "Congenital amputation",
    "content": "Congenital amputation\nDefinition\nCongenital amputation is the absence of a fetal\nlimb or fetal part at birth. This condition may be theresult of the constriction of fibrous bands within themembrane that surrounds the developing fetus (amnioticband syndrome) or the exposure to substances known tocause birth defects (teratogenic agents). Other factors,\nincluding genetics, may also play a role.\nDescription\nAn estimated one in 2,000 babies are born with all\nor part of a limb missing, ranging from a missing part ofa finger to the absence of both arms and both legs. Con-genital amputation is the least common reason foramputation. However, there are occasional periods inhistory where the number of congenital amputationsincreased. For example, the thalidomide tragedy of theearly 1960s occurred after pregnant mothers in westernEurope were given a tranquilizer containing the drug.The result was a drastic increase in the number of babiesborn with deformed limbs. In this example, the birthdefect usually presented itself as very small, deformedversions of normal limbs. More recently, birth defects asa result of radiation exposure near the site of the Cher-nobyl disaster in Russia have left numerous childrenwith malformed or absent limbs.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of congenital amputations is\nunknown. However, according to the March of Dimes,most birth defects have one or more genetic factors andone or more environmental factors. It is also known thatmost birth defects occur in the first three months of preg-\nnancy , when the organs of the fetus are forming. Within\nthese crucial first weeks, frequently prior to when awoman is aware of the pregnancy, the developing fetus ismost susceptible to substances that can cause birthdefects (teratogens). Exposure to teratogens can causecongenital amputation. In other cases, tight amnioticbands may constrict the developing fetus, preventing alimb from forming properly, if at all. It is estimated thatthis amniotic band syndrome occurs in between one in12,000 and one in 15,000 live births.\nAn infant with congenital amputation may be miss-\ning an entire limb or just a portion of a limb. Congenitalamputation resulting in the complete absence of a limbbeyond a certain point (and leaving a stump) is calledtransverse deficiency or amelia. Longitudinal deficien-cies occur when a specific part of a limb is missing; forexample, when the fibula bone in the lower leg is miss-ing, but the rest of the leg is intact. Phocomelia is thecondition in which only a mid-portion of a limb is miss-ing, as when the hands or feet are attached directly tothe trunk.\nDiagnosis\nMany cases of congenital amputation are not diag-\nnosed until the baby is born. Ultrasound examinationsmay reveal the absence of a limb in some developingfetuses, but routine ultrasounds may not pick up signs ofmore subtle defects. However, if a doctor suspects thatthe fetus is at risk for developing a limb deficiency (forexample, if the mother has been exposed to radiation), amore detailed ultrasound examination may be performed.\nTreatment\nSuccessful treatment of a child with congenital\namputation involves an entire medical team, including apediatrician, an orthopedist, a psychiatrist or psycholo-gist, a prosthetist (an expert in making prosthetics, orartificial limbs), a social worker, and occupational andphysical therapists. The accepted method of treatment isto fit the child early with a functional prosthesis becausethis leads to normal development and less wasting away(atrophy) of the muscles of the limbs present. However,some parents and physicians believe that the child shouldbe allowed to learn to play and perform tasks without aprosthesis, if possible. When the child is older, he or shecan be involved in the decision of whether or not to befitted for a prosthesis.\nRecently, there have been cases in which physicians\nhave detected amniotic band constriction interfering withlimb development fairly early in its course. In 1997, doc-tors at the Florida Institute for Fetal Diagnosis and Ther-apy reported two cases in which minimally invasivesurgery freed constricting amniotic bands and preservedthe affected limbs.\nAlternative treatment\nPrevention of birth defects begins with building the\nwell-being of the mother before pregnancy. Prenatal care\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 887Congenital amputationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 887should be strong and educational so that the mother\nunderstands both her genetic risks and her environmentalrisks. Several disciplines in alternative therapy also rec-ommend various supplements and vitamins that may\nreduce the chances of birth defects. If a surgical proce-dure is planned, naturopathic and homeopathic pre- andpost-surgical therapies can speed recovery.\nPrognosis\nA congenital limb deficiency has a profound effect\non the life of the child and parents. However, occupation-al therapy can help the child learn to accomplish manytasks. In addition, some experts believe that early fittingof a prosthesis will enhance acceptance of the prosthesisby the child and parents.\nPrevention\nStudies have suggested that a multivitamin including\nfolic acid may reduce birth defects, including congenital\nabnormalities. Smoking , drinking alcohol, and eating a\npoor diet while pregnant may increase the risk of con-genital abnormalities. Daily, heavy exposure to chemi-cals may be dangerous while pregnant.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBanasik, Jacquelyn L. “Genetic and Developmental Disor-\nders.” In Perspectives on Pathophysiology , ed.

Anexstrophic bladder is one that is open to the outside andturned inside-out, so that its inside is visible at birth, pro-truding from the lower abdomen. A diverticulum is anextension of a hollow organ, usually shaped like a pouchwith a narrow opening.\nDescription\nDuring fetal development, folds enclose tissues and\norgans and eventually fuse at the edges to form sealedcompartments. Both in the front and the back, foldseventually become major body structures. In the back,the entire spinal column folds in like a pipe wrapped in apillow. In the front, the entire lower urinary system isfolded in.\n• Exstrophy of the bladder represents a failure of this\nfolding process to complete itself, so the organs formwith more or less of their front side missing and open tothe outside. At the same time, the front of the pelvicbone is widely separated. The abdominal wall is open,too. In fact, the defect often extends all the way to thepenis in the male or splits the clitoris in the female.\n• A congenital bladder diverticulum represent an area of\nweakness in the bladder wall through which extrudessome of the lining of the bladder. (A small balloonsqueezed in a fist will create diverticula-like effectbetween the fingers.) Bladder diverticula may be multi-ple, and they often occur at the ureterovesical junc-tion—the entrance of the upper urinary system into thebladder. In this location, they may cause urine to refluxinto the ureter and kidney, leading to infection and pos-sible kidney damage.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs with many birth defects , the causes are not well\nknown. Lack of prenatal care and nutrition has been\nlinked to many birth defects; however, beyond the avoid-ance of known teratogens (anything that can cause a birthdefect), there is little prevention possible. Exstrophy israre, occurring in about one in 40,000 births. Diverticulaare more common, but less serious.\nIf left untreated, the patient with bladder exstrophy\nwill have no control over urination and is more likely todevelop bladder cancer . Diverticula, particularly if it\ncauses urine reflux, may lead to chronic infection and itssubsequent consequences.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 888Congenital bladder anomaliesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 888Diagnosis\nA major consideration with congenital abnormali-\nties is that they tend to be multiple. Further, each oneis unique in its extent and severity. Exstrophy caninvolve the rectum and large bowel and coexist withhernias. The obvious bladder exstrophy seen at birthwill prompt immediate action and a search for otheranomalies.\nDiverticula are not visible and will be detected only\nif they cause trouble. They are usually found in anexamination for the cause of recurring urinary infec-tions. X rays of the urinary system or a cystoscopy\n(examination with a telescope-like instrument) willidentify them. Often, the two procedures are donetogether: a urologist will perform the cystoscopy, then aradiologist will instill a contrast agent into the bladderand take x rays.\nTreatment\nSurgery is necessary and can usually produce suc-\ncessful results. If possible, the surgery must be donewithin 48 hours of birth. Prior to surgery, the exposedorgans must be protected and all related defects identi-fied and managed. Delay in the surgery leads to thefrequent need to divert the urine into the bowelbecause the partially repaired bladder cannot controlthe flow. After surgery, the likelihood of infectionrequires monitoring.\nAlternative treatment\nAfter surgery ongoing precautions to reduce fre-\nquency of infection may need to be used. Cranberryjuice has the ability to keep bacteria from adhering tothe membranes and can help prevent infection when-ever there is increased risk. There are botanical andhomeopathic treatments available, however consulta-tion by a trained practitioner is recommended beforetreatment.\nPrognosis\nWith immediate surgery, three-quarters of patients\ncan be successfully repaired. They will have control oftheir urine and no long-term consequences. The rate ofinfection is greater for those with congenital bladderanomalies, since any abnormality in the urinary systempredisposes it to invasion by bacteria.\nPrevention\nBirth defects often have no precisely identified\ncause, therefore prevention is limited to general mea-sures such as early and continuous prenatal care, appro-priate nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle.KEY TERMS\nCongenital —Present at birth.\nCystoscopy —Examination of the urinary bladder\nwith a thin telescope-like instrument.\nExstrophy —Being turned inside out combined\nwith being outside the body.\nDiverticulum —A pouch extending from a hollow\norgan.\nRadiologist —A physician who specializes in cre-\nating images of the internal organs of the body.\nTeratogen —Any agent that can cause birth defects.\nUreter —The tube that transports urine from the\nkidney to the bladder.\nUreterovesical junction —The joining of the ureter\nto the bladder.\nUrologist —A surgeon who specializes in diseases\nof the urinary system.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Anomalies of the Bladder.” In Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics ,\ned.

A com-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 889Congenital brain defectsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 889plex genetic program coordinates the formation, growth,\nand migration of billions of neurons, or nerve cells, andtheir development into discrete, interacting brainregions. Interruption of this program, especially early indevelopment, can cause structural defects in the brain.In addition, normal brain formation requires properdevelopment of the surrounding skull, and skull defectsmay lead to brain malformation. Congenital braindefects may be caused by inherited genetic defects,spontaneous mutations within the genes of the embryo,or effects on the embryo due to the mother’s infection,trauma, or drug use.\nEarly on in development, a flat strip of tissue\nalong the back of the fetus rolls up to form a tube. Thisso-called “neural tube” develops into the spinal cord,and at one end, the brain. Closure of the tube isrequired for subsequent development of the tissuewithin. Anencephaly (literally “without brain”), resultswhen the topmost portion of the tube fails to close.Anencephaly is the most common severe malformationseen in stillborn births. It is about four times morecommon in females than males. Anencephaly is some-times seen to run in families, and for parents who haveconceived one anencephalic fetus, the risk of a secondis as high as 5%. Fewer than half of babies with anen-cephaly are born alive, and survival beyond the firstmonth is rare.\nEncephalocele is a protrusion of part of the brain\nthrough a defect in the skull. The most common site forencephalocele is along the front-to-back midline of theskull, usually at the rear, although frontal encephalocelesare more common among Asians. Pressure within theskull pushes out cranial tissue. The protective layer overthe brain, the meninges, grows to cover the protrusion, asdoes skin in some cases. Defects in skull closure arethought to cause some cases of encephalocele, whiledefects in neural tube closure may cause others.Encephaloceles may be small and contain little or nobrain tissue, or may be quite large and contain a signifi-cant fraction of the brain.\nFailure of neural-tube closure below the level of\nthe brain prevents full development of the surroundingvertebral bones and leads to spina bifida , or a divided\nspinal column. Incomplete closure causes protrusionof the spinal cord and meninges, called meningomye-locele. Some cases of spina bifida are accompanied byanother defect at the base of the brain, known as theArnold-Chiari malformation or Chiari II malforma-tion. For reasons that are unclear, part of the cerebel-lum is displaced downward into the spinal column.Symptoms may be present at birth or delayed untilearly childhood.The Dandy-Walker malformation is marked by\nincomplete formation, or absence of, the central sectionof the cerebellum, and the growth of cysts within thelowest of the brain’s ventricles. The ventricles are fluid-filled cavities within the brain, through which cere-brospinal fluid (CSF) normally circulates. The cystsmay block the exit of the fluid, causing hydrocephalus .\nSymptoms may be present at birth or delayed until earlychildhood.\nSoon after closure of the neural tube, the brain\ndivides into two halves, or hemispheres. Failure of divi-sion is termed holoprosencephaly (literally “wholeforebrain”). Holoprosencephaly is almost alwaysaccompanied by facial and cranial deformities along themidline, including cleft lip, cleft palate, fused eye sock-ets and a single eye (cyclopia), and deformities of thelimbs, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other internalorgans. Most infants are either stillborn or die soonafter birth. Survivors suffer from severe neurologicalimpairments.\nThe normal ridges and valleys of the mature brain\nare formed after cells from the inside of the developingbrain migrate to the outside and multiply. When thesecells fail to migrate, the surface remains smooth, a con-dition called lissencephaly (“smooth brain”). Lissen-cephaly is often associated with facial abnormalitiesincluding a small jaw, a high forehead, a short nose, andlow-set ears.\nIf damaged during growth, especially within the\nfirst 20 weeks, brain tissue may stop growing, whiletissue around it continues to form. This causes anabnormal cleft or groove to appear on the surface ofthe brain, called schizencephaly (literally “splitbrain”). This cleft should not be confused with the nor-mal wrinkled brain surface, nor should the name bemistaken for schizophrenia , a mental disorder. Gener-\nalized destruction of tissue or lack of brain develop-ment may lead to hydranencephaly, in which cere-brospinal fluid fills much of the space normally occu-pied by the brain. Hydranencephaly is distinct fromhydrocephalus, in which CSF accumulates within anormally-formed brain, putting pressure on it and pos-sibly causing skull expansion.\nExcessive brain size is termed megalencephaly (lit-\nerally “big brain”). Megalencephaly is defined as anybrain size above the 98th percentile within the popula-tion. Some cases are familial, and may be entirelybenign. Others are due to metabolic or neurologic dis-ease. The opposite condition, microcephaly, may becaused by failure of the brain to develop, or by intrauter-ine infection, drug toxicity, or brain trauma.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 890Congenital brain defectsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 890Causes and symptoms\nCauses\nCongenital brain defects may have genetic, infec-\ntious, toxic, or traumatic causes. In most cases, no certaincause can be identified.\nGENETIC CAUSES. Some brain defects are caused by\ntrisomy, the inclusion of a third copy of a chromosomenormally occurring in pairs. Most trisomies occurbecause of improper division of the chromosomes duringformation of eggs or sperm. Trisomy of chromosome 9can cause some cases of Dandy-Walker and Chiari IImalformation. Some cases of holoprosencephaly arecaused by trisomy of chromosome 13, while others aredue to abnormalities in chromosomes 7 or 18. Individualgene defects, either inherited or spontaneous, are respon-sible for other cases of congenital brain malformations.\nDRUGS. Drugs known to cause congenital brain\ndefects when used by the mother during critical develop-mental periods include:\n• anticonvulsant drugs\n• retinoic acid and tretinoin• warfarin• alcohol\n• cocaine\nOTHER. Other causes of congenital brain defects\ninclude:\n• intrauterine infections, including cytomegalovirus,\nrubella , herpes simplex, and varicella zoster\n• maternal diabetes mellitus\n• maternal phenylketonuria\n• fetal trauma\nSymptoms\nBesides the features listed above, symptoms of con-\ngenital brain defects may include:\n• Chiari II malformation: impaired swallowing and gag\nreflex, loss of the breathing reflex, facial paralysis ,\nuncontrolled eye movements ( nystagmus ), impaired\nbalance and gait.\n• Dandy-Walker malformation: symptoms of hydro-\ncephalus, lack of muscle tone or “floppiness,” seizures,spasticity, deafness, irritability, visual impairment ,\ndeterioration of consciousness, paralysis.\n• Lissencephaly: lack of muscle tone, seizures, develop-\nmental delay, spasticity, cerebral palsy .\n• Hydranencephaly: irritability, spasticity, seizures, tem-\nperature oscillations.KEY TERMS\nAmniocentesis —Removal of fluid from the sac\nsurrounding a fetus for purposes of diagnosis.\nCerebrospinal fluid —Fluid produced within the\nbrain for nutrient transport and structural purposes.CSF circulates through the ventricles, open spaceswithin the brain, and drains through the mem-branes surrounding the brain.\nCongenital —Defect present at birth.\nFetus —The unborn human, developing in a\nwoman’s uterus, from the eighth week after fertil-ization to birth.\n• megalencephaly due to neurological or metabolic dis-\nease: mental retardation , seizures.\nDiagnosis\nCongenital brain defects are diagnosed either from\ndirect physical examination or imaging studies including\ncomputed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) scans.

    "title": "Congenital hip dysplasia",
    "content": "Congenital hip dysplasia\nDefinition\nA condition of abnormal development of the hip,\nresulting in hip joint instability and potential dislocationof the thigh bone from the socket in the pelvis. This con-dition has been more recently termed developmental hipdysplasia, as it often develops over the first few weeks,months, or years of life.\nDescription\nCongenital hip dysplasia is a disorder in children\nthat is either present at birth or shortly thereafter. Duringgestation, the infant’s hip should be developing with thehead of the thigh bone (femur) sitting perfectly centeredin its shallow socket (acetabulum). The acetabulumshould cover the head of the femur as if it were a ball sit-ting inside of a cup. In the event of congenital hip dyspla-sia, the development of the acetabulum in an infantallows the femoral head to ride upward out of the jointsocket, especially when weight bearing begins.\nCauses and symptoms\nClinical studies show a familial tendency toward hip\ndysplasia, with more females affected than males. Thisdisorder is found in many cultures around the world.However, statistics show that the Native American popu-lation has a high incidence of hip dislocation. This hasbeen documented to be due to the common practice ofswaddling and using cradleboards for restraining theinfants. This places the infant’s hips into extreme adduc-tion (brought together). The incidence of congenital hipdysplasia is also higher in infants born by caesarian andbreech position births. Evidence also shows a greaterchance of this hip abnormality in the first born comparedto the second or third child. Hormonal changes within themother during pregnancy , resulting in increased ligament\nlaxity, is thought to possibly cross over to the placentaand cause the baby to have lax ligaments while still in thewomb. Other symptoms of complete dislocation include ashortening of the leg and limited ability to abduct the leg.\nDiagnosis\nBecause the abnormalities of this hip problem often\nvary, a thorough physical examination is necessary for\nan accurate diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. Thehip disorder can be diagnosed by moving the hip todetermine if the head of the femur is moving in and outof the hip joint. One specific method, called the Ortolanitest, begins with each of the examiners’ hands around theinfant’s knees, with the second and third fingers pointingdown the child’s thigh. With the legs abducted (movedapart), the examiner may be able to discern a distinctclicking sound with motion. If symptoms are presentwith a noted increase in abduction, the test is consideredpositive for hip joint instability. It is important to notethis test is only valid a few weeks after birth.\nThe Barlow method is another test performed with the\ninfant’s hip brought together with knees in full bent posi-tion. The examiner’s middle finger is placed over the out-side of the hipbone while the thumb is placed on the innerside of the knee. The hip is abducted to where it can be feltif the hip is sliding out and then back in the joint. In olderbabies, if there is a lack of range of motion in one hip oreven both hips, it is possible that the movement is blockedbecause the hip has dislocated and the muscles have con-tracted in that position. Also in older infants, hip disloca-tion is evident if one leg looks shorter than the other.\nX-ray films can be helpful in detecting abnormal find-\nings of the hip joint. X rays may also be helpful in findingthe proper positioning of the hip joint for treatments of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 892Congenital hip dysplasiaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 892casting. Ultrasound has been noted as a safe and effective\ntool for the diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. Ultra-sound has advantages over x rays, as several positions arenoted during the ultrasound procedure. This is in contrastto only one position observed during the x ray.\nTreatment\nThe objective of treatment is to replace the head of the\nfemur into the acetabulum and, by applying constant pres-sure, to enlarge and deepen the socket. In the past, stabi-lization was achieved by placing rolled cotton diapers or apillow between the thighs, thereby keeping the knees in afrog like position. More recently, the Pavlik harness andvon Rosen splint are commonly used in infants up to theage of six months. A stiff shell cast may be used, whichachieves the same purpose, spreading the legs apart andforcing the head of the femur into the acetabulum. In somecases, in older children between six to 18 months, surgerymay be necessary to reposition the joint. Also at this age,the use of closed manipulation may be applied successful-ly, by moving the leg around manually to replace joint.Operations are not only performed to reduce the disloca-tion of the hip, but also to repair a defect in the acetabu-lum. A cast is applied after the operation to hold the headof the femur in the correct position. The use of a hometraction program is now more common. However, after\nthe age of eight years, surgical procedures are primarilydone for pain reduction measures only. Total hip surgeries\nmay be inevitable later in adulthood.\nAlternative treatment\nNonsurgical treatments include exercise programs,\northosis (a force system, often involving braces), andmedications. A physical therapist may develop a programthat includes strengthening, range-of-motion exercises,pain control, and functional activities. Chiropractic\nmedicine may be helpful, especially the procedures ofclosed manipulations, to reduce the dislocated hip joint.\nPrognosis\nUnless corrected soon after birth, abnormal stresses\ncause malformation of the developing femur, with a char-acteristic limp or waddling gait. If cases of congenitalhip dysplasia go untreated, the child will have difficultywalking, which could result in life-long pain. In addition,if this condition goes untreated, the abnormal hip posi-tioning will force the acetabulum to locate to anotherposition to accommodate the displaced femur.\nPrevention\nPrevention includes proper prenatal care to deter-\nmine the position of the baby in the womb. This may beKEY TERMS\nAcetabulum —The large cup-shaped cavity at the\njunction of pelvis and femur or thigh bone.\nOrthosis —A force system designed to control or\ncorrect or compensate for a bone deformity,deforming forces, or forces absent from the body.\nhelpful in preparing for possible breech births associated\nwith hip problems.

Congenitallobar emphysema is more common in boys than in girls.\nEach person has two lungs, right and left. The right\nlung is divided into three sections, called lobes, and theleft lung into two lobes. Congenital lobar emphysemausually affects only one lobe, and this is usually an upperlobe. It occurs most frequently in the left upper lobe, fol-lowed by the right middle lobe.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of congenital lobar emphysema often can-\nnot be identified.

    "title": "Congenital ureter anomalies",
    "content": "Congenital ureter anomalies\nDefinition\nThe ureter drains urine from the kidney into the\nbladder. It is not simply a tube but an active organ thatpropels urine forward by muscular action. It has a valveat its bottom end that prevents urine from flowing back-ward into the kidney. Normally, there is one ureter oneach side of the body for each kidney. However, amongthe many abnormalities of ureteral development, duplica-tion is quite common. Ureters may also be malformed ina variety of ways—some harmful, others not.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 894Congenital ureter anomaliesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 894Description\nThe urogenital system, for some reason, is more\nlikely than any other to have birth defects , and they can\noccur in endless variety. Ureters can be duplicated com-pletely or partially, they can be in the wrong place, theycan be deformed, and they can end in the wrong place.The trouble these abnormalities bring is directly relatedto their effect on the flow of urine. As long as urine flowsnormally through them, and only in one direction, noharm is done.\n• Duplication of ureters is quite common, either in part or\ncompletely. Kidneys are sometimes duplicated as well.Someone may have four kidneys and four ureters or twokidneys, half of each drained by a separate ureter, or a sin-gle kidney with two, three, or four ureters attached. Aslong as urine can flow easily in the correct direction, suchmalformations may never be detected. If, however, one ofthe ureters has a dead end, a stricture or stenosis (narrow-ing), or a leaky ureterovesical valve (valve between theureter and bladder), infection is the likely result.\n• Stricture or stenosis of a ureter prevents urine from\nflowing freely. Whenever flow is obstructed in thebody—urine, bile, mucus, or any other liquid—infec-tion follows. Ureters can be obstructed anywhere alongtheir course, though the ureterovesical valve is the mostcommon place.\n• A ureter may have an ectopic (out of place) orifice\n(opening)—it may enter the bladder, or even anotherstructure, where it does not belong and therefore with-out an adequate valve to control reflux.\n• The primary ureter, or a duplicate, may not even reach\nthe bladder, but rather terminate in a dead end. Urinewill stagnate there and eventually cause infection.\n• A ureter can be perfectly normal but in the wrong place,\nsuch as behind the vena cava (the large vein in the mid-dle of the abdomen). A so-called retrocaval ureter maybe pinched by the vena cava so that flow is hindered.Other aberrant locations may also lead to compressionand impaired flow.\nBesides infection, urine that backs up will cause the\nureter and the kidney to dilate. Eventually, the kidneywill stop functioning because of the back pressure. Thiscondition is called hydronephrosis—a kidney swollenwith urine.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of birth defects are multiple and often\nunknown. Furthermore, the precise cause of specificbirth defects has only rarely been identified. Such is thecase with congenital ureteral anomalies.KEY TERMS\nCongenital —Present at birth.\nContrast agent —A chemical or other substance\nplaced in the body to show structures that wouldnot otherwise be visible on x ray or other imagingstudies.\nCystoscopy —Looking into the urinary bladder\nwith a thin telescope-like instrument.\nEctopic —Out of place.\nSepticemia —A serious whole body infection\nspreading through the blood stream.\nUretreovesical valve —A sphincter (an opening\ncontrolled by a circular muscle), located wherethe ureter enters the bladder, that keeps urine fromflowing backward toward the kidney.\nUrogenital —Both the urinary system and the sex-\nual organs, which form together in the developingembryo.\nPractically the only symptom generated by ureteral\nabnormalities is urinary tract infection. A lower tractinfection—in the bladder—is called cystitis . In children,\nit may cause fever and systemic symptoms, but in adults\nit causes only cloudy, burning, and frequent urine. Uppertract infections, on the other hand, can be serious for bothadults and children, causing high fevers, back pain ,\nsevere generalized discomfort, and even leading to kid-ney failure or septicemia (infection spreading throughoutthe body by way of the blood stream).\nIn rare cases, urine from an ectopic ureter will bypass\nthe bladder and dribble out of the bottom somewhere,through a natural orifice like the vagina or a completelyseparate unnatural opening.\nDiagnosis\nSerious or recurrent urinary infections will prompt a\nsearch for underlying abnormalities. Cystoscopy (look-\ning into the bladder with a thin telescope-like instrument)and x rays with a contrast agent to illuminate the urinarysystem will usually identify the defect. Computed\ntomography scans (CT) and magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) scans may provide additional informa-\ntion. Urine cultures to identify the infecting germs willbe repeated frequently until the problem is corrected.\nTreatment\nSometimes the recurring infections caused by flow\nabnormalities can be treated with repeated and changing\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 895Congenital ureter anomaliesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 895courses of antibiotics . Over time, the infecting germs\ndevelop resistance to most treatments, especially thesafer ones. If it can be done with acceptable risk, it is bet-ter to repair the defect surgically. Urologists have anarsenal of approaches to urine drainage that range fromsimply reimplanting a ureter into the bladder, in such away that an effective valve is created, to building a newbladder out of a piece of bowel.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are botanical and homeopathic treatments\navailable for urinary tract infection. None can take theplace of correcting a problem that is occurring because ofa malformed or dysfunctional organ system. Once cor-rection of the cause is addressed and there is unimpededflow of urine, adequate fluid intake can contribute to pre-vention of future infections.\nPrognosis\nAs long as damage to the kidneys from infection or\nback pressure has not become significant, the surgicalrepair of troublesome ureteral defects produces excellentlong-term results in the great majority of cases. Monitor-ing for recurrent infections is always a good idea, andoccasional checking of kidney function will detect hid-den ongoing damage.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBauer, Stuart B. “Anomalies of the Kidney and Ureteropelvic\nJunction.” In Campbell’s Urology , ed.

    "title": "Congestive cardiomyopathy",
    "content": "Congestive cardiomyopathy\nDefinition\nCardiomyopathy is an ongoing disease process that\ndamages the muscle wall of the lower chambers of theheart. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the most commonform of cardiomyopathy. In congestive cardiomyopathy,also called dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of the heartchambers stretch (dilate) to hold a greater volume ofblood than normal. Congestive cardiomyopathy is thefinal stage of many heart diseases and the most commoncondition resulting in congestive heart failure .\nDescription\nAbout 50,000 Americans develop cardiomyopathy\neach year. Of those, 87% have congestive cardiomyopa-thy. Primary cardiomyopathy accounts for only 1% of alldeaths from heart disease.\nWhen the heart muscle is damaged by a disease\nprocess, it cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’sneeds. Uninjured areas of the walls of the two lower heartchambers (called ventricles) stretch to make up for thelost pumping action. At first, the enlarged chambers allowmore blood to be pumped with less force. The stretchedmuscle can also contract more forcefully. Over time, theheart muscle continues to stretch, ultimately becomingweaker. The heart is forced to work harder to pump bloodby beating faster. Eventually it cannot keep up, and bloodbacks up into the veins, legs, and lungs. When this hap-pens, the condition is called congestive heart failure.\nCongestive cardiomyopathy usually affects both\nventricles. Blood backed up into the lungs from the leftventricle causes fluid to congest the lung tissue. This iscalled pulmonary edema . When the right ventricle fails\nto pump enough blood, blood backs up into the veinscausing edema in the legs, feet, ankles, and abdomen.\nCauses and symptoms\nCongestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a\nnumber of conditions. Cardiomyopathy with a knowncause is called secondary cardiomyopathy. When nocause can be identified, it is called primary cardiomyopa-thy or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. About 80% of all casesof cardiomyopathy do not have a known cause. Manyheart specialists think that many cases of idiopathic con-gestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a viral infec-tion. Because cardiomyopathy may occur many yearsafter a viral infection and viruses sometimes go undetect-ed in laboratory tests, it is difficult to know if a virus is thecause. Some people have a weak heart from advancedcoronary artery disease that causes heart muscle dam-\nage. This is sometimes called ischemic cardiomyopathy.\nConditions that can cause congestive cardiomyopa-\nthy are:\n• Coronary artery disease\n• Infections\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 896Congestive cardiomyopathyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 896• noninfectious inflammatory conditions\n• alcohol and other drugs or toxins•hypertension\n• nutritional and metabolic disorders\n•pregnancy .\nCoronary artery disease is one of the most common\ncauses of congestive cardiomyopathy. In coronary arterydisease, the arteries supplying blood to the heart becomenarrowed or blocked. When blood flow to an area of theheart is completely blocked, the person has a heart\nattack . The heart muscle suffers damage when its blood\nsupply is reduced or blocked. Significant recurrent mus-cle damage can occur silently. This damage can lead tocongestive cardiomyopathy.\nInfections caused by bacteria, viruses, and other\nmicroorganisms can involve the heart, causing inflamma-tion of the heart muscle ( myocarditis ). The inflamma-\ntion may damage the heart muscle and cause congestivecardiomyopathy.

For example, the conditions sarcoidosis , gran-\nulomatous myocarditis, and Wegener’s granulomatosis\ncause inflammation and tissue death in the heart muscle.\nYears of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can\nweaken the heart muscle, leading to congestive cardiomy-opathy. Other drugs and toxins, such as cocaine , pesti-\ncides, and other chemicals, may have the same effect.\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) puts extra pres-\nsure on blood vessels and the heart. This increased pres-sure makes the heart work harder to pump blood, whichmay thicken and damage the chamber walls.\nSevere nutritional deficiencies can weaken the heart\nmuscle and affect its pumping ability. Certain disordersof metabolism, including diabetes mellitus and thyroid\ndisorders, can also lead to congestive cardiomyopathy.\nOccasionally, inflammation of the heart muscle and\ncongestive cardiomyopathy may develop late in pregnan-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 897Congestive cardiomyopathyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 897cy or shortly after a woman gives birth. This type of con-\ngestive cardiomyopathy is called peripartum cardiomy-opathy. The cause of congestive cardiomyopathy in preg-nancy is not known.\nCongestive cardiomyopathy usually is a chronic\ncondition, developing gradually over time. Patients withearly congestive cardiomyopathy may not have symp-toms. The most common symptoms are fatigue and\nshortness of breath on exertion. Unfortunately, sudden\ncardiac death is not uncommon with this condition. It\nstems from irregular heart rhythms in the ventricles (ven-tricular arrhythmias ).\nPatients with more advanced congestive cardiomy-\nopathy may also have chest or abdominal pains, extremetiredness, dizziness , and swelling of the legs and ankles.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of congestive cardiomyopathy is based on:\n• symptoms• medical history\n•physical examination\n•chest x ray\n• electrocardiogram (ECG; also called EKG)\n• echocardiogram\n•cardiac catheterization\nThe diagnosis is based on the patient’s symptoms, a\ncomplete physical examination, and tests that detectabnormalities of the heart chambers. The physician lis-tens to the heart with a stethoscope to detect abnormalheart rhythms and heart sounds. A heart murmur mightmean that the heart valves are not closing properly due tothe ventricles being enlarged.\nA chest x ray can show if the heart is enlarged and if\nthere is fluid in the lungs. Abnormalities of heart valvesand other structures may also be seen on a chest x ray.\nAn electrocardiogram provides a record of electrical\nchanges in the heart muscle during the heartbeat. It givesinformation on the heart rhythm and can show if theheart chamber is enlarged. An ECG can detect damage tothe heart muscle and the amount of damage.\nEchocardiography uses sound waves to make\nimages of the heart. These images can show if the heartwall or chambers are enlarged and if there are any abnor-malities of the heart valves. Echocardiography can alsoevaluate the pumping efficiency of the ventricles.\nCardiac catheterization usually is only used if a\ndiagnosis cannot be made with other methods. In cardiaccatheterization, a small tube (called a catheter) is insertedinto an artery and passed into the heart. It is used to mea-\nsure pressure in the heart and the amount of bloodpumped by the heart. A small tissue sample of the heartmuscle can be removed through the catheter for examina-tion under a microscope (biopsy). This biopsy can showthe type and amount of damage to the heart muscle.\nTreatment\nWhen a patient is diagnosed with congestive car-\ndiomyopathy, physicians try to find out the cause. Ifcoronary artery disease is not the culprit, in most othercases a cause is not identified. When a condition respon-sible for the congestive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed,treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying condi-tion. Congestive cardiomyopathy caused by drinkingexcess alcohol or by drugs or toxins can be treated byeliminating the alcohol or toxin completely. In somecases, the heart may recover after the toxic substance isremoved from the body. Bacterial myocarditis is treatedwith an antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria.\nThere is no cure for idiopathic congestive cardiomy-\nopathy. Medicines are given to reduce the workload ofthe heart and to relieve the symptoms.\nOne or more of the following types of medicines\nmay be prescribed for congestive cardiomyopathy:\n• digitalis\n•diuretics\n•vasodilators\n•beta blockers\n• angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhib-\nitors)\n• angiotensin receptor blockers\nDigitalis helps the heart muscle to have stronger\npumping action. Diuretics help eliminate excess salt andwater from the kidneys by making patients urinate moreoften. This helps reduce the swelling caused by fluidbuildup in the tissues. Vasodilators, beta blockers, andACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and expand theblood vessels so blood can move more easily throughthem. This action makes it easier for the heart to pumpblood through the vessels.\nPatients may also be given anticoagulant medica-\ntions to prevent clots from forming due to pooling ofblood in the heart chambers. Medicines to prevent abnor-mal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) may be given, but someof these drugs can also reduce the force of heart contrac-tions. Automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators(AICDs) can treat life-threatening arrhythmias, whichare relatively common in severe cardiomyopathy.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 898Congestive cardiomyopathyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 898Certain lifestyle changes may help reduce the work-\nload on the heart and relieve symptoms. Some patientsmay need to change their diet, stop drinking alcohol,begin a physician-supervised exercise program, and/or\nstop smoking .\nSevere congestive cardiomyopathy usually causes\nheart failure. When the heart muscle is damaged soseverely that medicines cannot help, a heart transplantmay be the only remaining treatment to be considered.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for a patient with congestive cardiomy-\nopathy depends on the severity of the disease and theperson’s health. Generally, congestive cardiomyopathyworsens over time and the prognosis is not good. About50% of patients with congestive cardiomyopathy live forfive years after the diagnosis. Twenty five percent ofpatients are alive 10 years after diagnosis. Women withcongestive cardiomyopathy live twice as long as menwith the disease. Many of the deaths are caused by sud-den abnormal heart rhythms.\nPrevention\nBecause idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy does\nnot have a known cause, there is no sure way to preventit. The best way to prevent congestive cardiomyopathy isto avoid known causes such as drinking excess alcohol ortaking toxic drugs. Eating a nutritious diet and gettingregular exercise to improve overall fitness also can helpthe heart to stay healthy.\nCongestive cardiomyopathy may also be prevented by\nidentifying and treating any conditions that might damagethe heart muscle. These include high blood pressure andcoronary artery disease. Regular blood pressure checksand obtaining immediate medical care for hypertensionand symptoms of coronary artery disease, such as chestpain, are important to keep the heart functioning properly.\nFinally, diagnosing and treating congestive car-\ndiomyopathy before the heart becomes severely damagedmay improve the outlook.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBellenir, Karen, and Peter D.

    "title": "Congenital heart disease",
    "content": "Congenital heart disease\nDefinition\nCongenital heart disease, also called congenital\nheart defect, includes a variety of malformations of theheart or its major blood vessels that are present at birth.\nDescription\nCongenital heart disease occurs when the heart or\nblood vessels near the heart do not develop properlybefore birth. Some infants are born with mild types ofcongenital heart disease, but most need surgery in orderto survive. Patients who have had surgery are likely toexperience other cardiac problems later in life.\nMost types of congenital heart disease obstruct the\nflow of blood in the heart or the nearby vessels, or causean abnormal flow of blood through the heart. Rarer typesof congenital heart disease occur when the newborn hasonly one ventricle, or when the pulmonary artery and theaorta come out of the same ventricle, or when one side ofthe heart is not completely formed.\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nPatent ductus arteriosus refers to the opening of a\npassageway—or temporary blood vessel (ductus)—tocarry the blood from the heart to the aorta before birth,allowing blood to bypass the lungs, which are not yetfunctional. The ductus should close spontaneously in thefirst few hours or days after birth. When it does not closein the newborn, some of the blood that should flowthrough the aorta then returns to the lungs. Patent ductusarteriosus is common in premature babies, but rare infull-term babies. It has also been associated with motherswho had German measles (rubella ) while pregnant.\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome, a condition in\nwhich the left side of the heart is underdeveloped, is rare,but it is the most serious type of congenital heart disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 899Congenital heart diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 899With this syndrome, blood reaches the aorta, which\npumps blood to the entire body, only from the ductus,which then normally closes within a few days of birth. Inhypoplastic left heart syndrome, the baby seems normalat birth, but as the ductus closes, blood cannot reach theaorta and circulation fails.\nObstruction defects\nWhen heart valves, arteries, or veins are narrowed,\nthey partly or completely block the flow of blood. Themost common obstruction defects are pulmonary valve\nstenosis ,aortic valve stenosis , and coarctation of the\naorta . Bicuspid aortic valve and subaortic stenosis are\nless common.\nStenosis is a narrowing of the valves or arteries. In\npulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve does not openproperly, forcing the right ventricle to work harder. Inaortic stenosis, the improperly formed aortic valve is nar-rowed. As the left ventricle works harder to pump bloodthrough the body, it becomes enlarged. In coarctation ofthe aorta, the aorta is constricted, reducing the flow ofblood to the lower part of the body and increasing bloodpressure in the upper body.\nA bicuspid aortic valve has only two flaps instead\nof three, which can lead to stenosis in adulthood.Subaortic stenosis is a narrowing of the left ventriclebelow the aortic valve, that limits the flow of blood fromthe left ventricle.\nSeptal defects\nWhen a baby is born with a hole in the septum (the\nwall separating the right and left sides of the heart),blood leaks from the left side of the heart to the right,or from a higher pressure zone to a lower pressurezone. A major leakage can lead to enlargement of theheart and failing circulation. The most common typesof septal defects are atrial septal defect , an opening\nbetween the two upper heart chambers, and ventricu-\nlar septal defect , an opening between the two lower\nheart chambers. Ventricular septal defect accounts forabout 15% of all cases of congenital heart disease inthe United States.\nCyanotic defects\nHeart disorders that cause a decreased, inadequate\namount of oxygen in blood pumped to the body arecalled cyanotic defects. Cyanotic defects, including trun-cus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return,tetralogy of Fallot ,transposition of the great arteries ,\nand tricuspid atresia, result in a blue discoloration of theskin due to low oxygen levels. About 10% of cases ofcongenital heart disease in the United States are tetralogy\nof Fallot, which includes four defects. The major defectsare a large hole between the ventricles, which allowsoxygen-poor blood to mix with oxygen-rich blood, andnarrowing at or beneath the pulmonary valve. The otherdefects are an overly muscular right ventricle and anaorta that lies over the ventricular hole.\nIn transposition (reversal of position) of the great\narteries, the pulmonary artery and the aorta are reversed,causing oxygen-rich blood to re-circulate to the lungswhile oxygen-poor blood goes to the rest of the body. Intricuspid atresia, the baby lacks a triscupid valve andblood cannot flow properly from the right atrium to theright ventricle.\nOther defects\nEbstein’s anomaly is a rare congenital syndrome that\ncauses malformed tricuspid valve leaflets, which allowblood to leak between the right ventricle and the rightatrium. It also may cause a hole in the wall between theleft and right atrium. Treatment often involves repairingthe tricuspid valve. Ebstein’s anomaly may be associatedwith maternal use of the psychiatric drug lithium duringpregnancy .\nBrugada syndrome is another rare congenital heart\ndefect that appears in adulthood and may cause suddendeath if untreated. Symptoms, which include rapid,\nuneven heart beat, often appear at night. Scientists believethat Brugada syndrome is caused by mutations in the geneSCN5A, which involves cardiac sodium channels.\nInfants born with DiGeorge sequence can have heart\ndefects such as a malformed aortic arch and tetralogy ofFallot. Researchers believe DiGeorge sequence is mostoften caused by mutations in genes in the region 22q11.\nMarfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder\nthat causes tears in the aorta. Since the disease also causesexcessive bone growth, most Marfan syndrome patientsare over six feet tall. In athletes, and others, it can lead tosudden death. Researchers believe the defect responsiblefor Marfan’s syndrome is found in gene FBN1, on chro-mosome 15.\nAbout 32,000 infants are born every year with con-\ngenital heart disease, which is the most common birthdefect. About half of these cases require medical treat-ment. More than one million people with heart defectsare currently living in the United States.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn most cases, the causes of congenital heart disease\nare unknown. Genetic and environmental factors andlifestyle habits can all be involved. The likelihood of hav-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 900Congenital heart diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 900ing a child with a congenital heart disease increases if the\nmother or father, another child, or another relative hadcongenital heart disease or a family history of suddendeath. Viral infections, such as German measles, can pro-duce congenital heart disease. Women with diabetes andphenylketonuria also are at higher risk of having chil-\ndren with congenital heart defects. Many cases of congen-ital heart disease result from the mother’s excessive use ofalcohol or taking illegal drugs, such as cocaine , while\npregnant. The mother’s exposure to certain anticonvulsantand dermatologic drugs during pregnancy can also causecongenital heart disease. There are many genetic condi-tions, such as Down syndrome , which affect multiple\norgans and can cause congenital heart disease.\nSymptoms of congenital heart disease in general\ninclude: shortness of breath , difficulty feeding in infan-\ncy, sweating, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin),\nheart murmur, respiratory infections that recur excessive-ly, stunted growth, and limbs and muscles that are under-developed.\nSymptoms of specific types of congenital heart dis-\nease are as follows:\n• Patent ductus arteriosus: quick tiring, slow growth, sus-\nceptibility to pneumonia , rapid breathing. If the ductus\nis small, there are no symptoms.\n• Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: ashen color, rapid and\ndifficult breathing, inability to eat.\n• Obstruction defects: cyanosis (skin that is discolored\nblue), chest pain , tiring easily, dizziness or fainting ,\ncongestive heart failure , and high blood pressure.\n• Septal defects: difficulty breathing, stunted growth.\nSometimes there are no symptoms.\n• Cyanotic defects: cyanosis, sudden rapid breathing or\nunconsciousness, and shortness of breath and faintingduring exercise .\nDiagnosis\nEchocardiography and cardiac magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) are used to confirm congenital\nheart disease when it is suggested by the symptoms andphysical examination . An echocardiograph will display\nan image of the heart that is formed by sound waves. Itdetects valve and other heart problems. Fetal echocardio-graphy is used to diagnose congenital heart disease inutero, usually after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Between 10and 14 weeks of pregnancy, physicians also may use anultrasound to look for a thickness at the nuchal translu-cency, a pocket of fluid in back of the embryo’s neck,which may indicate a cardiac defect in 55% of cases.Cardiac MRI, a scanning method that uses magneticKEY TERMS\nAorta —The main artery located above the heart\nthat pumps oxygenated blood out into the body.Many congenital heart defects affect the aorta.\nCongenital —Refers to a disorder that is present at\nbirth.\nCyanotic —Marked by bluish discoloration of the\nskin due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. It is oneof the types of congenital heart disease.\nDuctus —The blood vessel that joins the pul-\nmonary artery and the aorta. When the ductusdoes not close at birth, it causes a type of congeni-tal heart disease called patent ductus arteriosus.\nElectrocardiograph (ECG, EKG) —A test used to\nmeasure electrical impulses coming from the heartin order to gain information about its structure orfunction.\nHypoplastic —Incomplete or underdevelopment\nof a tissue or organ. Hypoplastic left heart syn-drome is the most serious type of congenital heartdisease.\nNeuchal translucency— A pocket of fluid at the\nback of an embryo’s neck visible via ultrasoundthat, when thickened, may indicate the infant willbe born with a congenital heart defect.\nSeptal —Relating to the septum, the thin muscle\nwall dividing the right and left sides of the heart.Holes in the septum are called septal defects.\nStenosis —The constricting or narrowing of an\nopening or passageway.\nfields and radio waves, can help physicians evaluate con-\ngenital heart disease, but is not always necessary. Physi-cians also may use a chest x ray to look at the size andlocation of the heart and lungs, or an electrocardiograph(ECG), which measures electrical impulses to create agraph of the heart beat.\nTreatment\nCongenital heart disease is treated with drugs and/or\nsurgery. Drugs used include diuretics , which aid the\nbaby in excreting water and salts, and digoxin, whichstrengthens the contraction of the heart, slows the heart-beat, and removes fluid from tissues.\nSurgical procedures seek to repair the defect as\nmuch as possible and restore circulation to as close to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 901Congenital heart diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 901normal as possible. Sometimes, multiple surgical proce-\ndures are necessary. Surgical procedures include: arterialswitch, balloon atrial septostomy, balloon valvulo-\nplasty , Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, Fontan proce-\ndure, pulmonary artery banding, Ross procedure, shuntprocedure, and venous switch or intra-atrial baffle.\nArterial switch, to correct transposition of the great\narteries, involves connecting the aorta to the left ventricleand connecting the pulmonary artery to the right ventri-cle. Balloon atrial septostomy, also done to correct trans-position of the great arteries, enlarges the atrial openingduring heart catheterization. Balloon valvuloplasty uses aballoon-tipped catheter to open a narrowed heart valve,improving the flow of blood in pulmonary stenosis. It issometimes used in aortic stenosis. Transposition of thegreat arteries can also be corrected by the Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, in which the pulmonary artery is cutin two and connected to the ascending aorta and the far-thest section of the right ventricle.\nFor tricuspid atresia and pulmonary atresia, the\nFontan procedure connects the right atrium to the pul-monary artery directly or with a conduit, and the atrialdefect is closed. Pulmonary artery banding, narrowingthe pulmonary artery with a band to reduce blood flowand pressure in the lungs, is used for ventricular septaldefect, atrioventricular canal defect, and tricuspid atresia.Later, the band can be removed and the defect correctedwith open-heart surgery.\nTo correct aortic stenosis, the Ross procedure grafts\nthe pulmonary artery to the aorta. For tetralogy of Fallot,tricuspid atresia, or pulmonary atresia, the shunt proce-dure creates a passage between blood vessels, sendingblood into parts of the body that need it. For transposi-tion of the great arteries, venous switch creates a tunnelinside the atria to re-direct oxygen-rich blood to the rightventricle and aorta and venous blood to the left ventricleand pulmonary artery.\nWhen all other options fail, some patients may need\na heart transplant. Children with congenital heart diseaserequire lifelong monitoring, even after successfulsurgery. The American Heart Association recommendsregular dental check-ups and the preventive use ofantibiotics to protect patients from heart infections, or\nendocarditis . Since children with congenital heart dis-\nease have slower growth, nutrition is important. Physi-\ncians may also limit their athletic activity.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for children with congenital heart dis-\nease has improved markedly in the past two decades.Many types of congenital heart disease that would havebeen fatal can now be treated successfully. Research on\ndiagnosing heart defects when the fetus is in the wombmay lead to future treatment to correct defects beforebirth. Promising new prevention methods and treatmentsinclude genetic screening and the cultivation of cardiactissue in the laboratory that could be used to repair con-genital heart defects.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMayo Clinic Heart Book.

    "title": "Conjunctivitis",
    "content": "Conjunctivitis\nDefinition\nConjuctivitis is an inflammation or redness of the\nlining of the white part of the eye and the underside ofthe eyelid (conjunctiva) that can be caused by infection,allergic reaction, or physical agents like infrared or ultra-violet light.\nDescription\nConjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjuncti-\nva, a thin, delicate membrane that covers the eyeball andlines the eyelid. Conjunctivitis is an extremely commoneye problem because the conjunctiva is continually\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 902ConjunctivitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 902exposed to microorganisms and environmental agents\nthat can cause infections or allergic reactions. Conjunc-tivitis can be acute or chronic depending upon how longthe condition lasts, the severity of symptoms, and thetype of organism or agent involved. It can also affect oneor both eyes and, if caused by infection, can be very easi-ly transmitted to others during close physical contact,particularly among children in a daycare center. Othernames for conjunctivitis include pink eye and red eye.\nCauses and symptoms\nConjunctivitis may be caused by a viral infection,\nsuch as a cold, acute respiratory infection, or diseasesuch as measles , herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. Symp-\ntoms include mild to severe discomfort in one or botheyes, redness, swelling of the eyelids, and watery, yellow,or green discharge. Symptoms may last anywhere fromseveral days to two weeks. Infection with an adenovirus,however, may also cause a significant amount of pus-likedischarge and a scratchy, foreign body-type of sensationin the eye. This may also be accompanied by swellingand tenderness of the lymph nodes near the ear.\nBacterial conjunctivitis can occur in adults and chil-\ndren and is caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus ,\nStreptococcus , and Hemophilus . Symptoms of bacterial\nconjunctivitis include a pus-like discharge and crustyeyelids after awakening. Redness of the conjunctiva canbe mild to severe and may be accompanied by swelling.Persons with symptoms of conjunctivitis who are sexual-ly active may possibly be infected with the bacteria thatcause either gonorrhea or chlamydia. There may be\nlarge amounts of pus-like discharge, and symptoms mayinclude intolerance to light (photophobia), waterymucous discharge, and tenderness in the lymph nodesnear the ear that may persist for up to three months.\nConjunctivitis may also be caused by environmental\nhazards, such as wind, smoke, dust, and allergic reac-tions caused by pollen, dust, or grass. Symptoms rangefrom itching and redness to a mucous discharge. Persons\nwho wear contact lenses may develop allergic conjunc-tivitis caused by the various eye solutions and foreignproteins contained in them.\nOther less common causes of conjunctivitis include\nexposure to sun lamps or the electrical arcs used duringwelding, and problems with inadequate drainage of thetear ducts.\nDiagnosis\nAn accurate diagnosis of conjunctivitis centers on\ntaking a patient history to learn when symptoms began,how long the condition has been going on, the symptomsexperienced, and other predisposing factors, such as\nupper respiratory complaints, allergies ,sexually trans-\nmitted diseases , herpes simplex infections, and exposure\nto persons with pink eye. It may be helpful to learnwhether an aspect of an individual’s occupation may bethe cause, for example, welding. Diagnostic tests are usu-ally not indicated unless initial treatment fails or an infec-tion with gonorrhea or chlamydia is suspected. In suchcases, the discharge may be cultured and Gram stained todetermine the organism responsible for causing the condi-tion. Cultures and smears are relatively painless.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of conjunctivitis depends on what\ncaused the condition. In all cases, warm compressesapplied to the affected eye several times a day may helpto reduce discomfort.\nConjunctivitis due to a viral infection, particularly\nthose due to adenoviruses, are usually treated by applyingwarm compresses to the eye(s) and applying topical antibi-otic ointments to prevent secondary bacterial infections.\nViral conjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex should\nbe referred to an ophthalmologist. Topical steroids are com-monly prescribed in combination with antiviral therapy.\nIn cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, a physician may\nprescribe an antibiotic eye ointment or eye drops contain-ing sodium sulfacetamide (Sulamyd) to be applied dailyfor seven to 14 days. If, after 72 hours, the condition doesnot improve, a physician or primary care provider shouldbe notified because the bacteria involved may be resistantto the antibiotic used or the cause may not be bacterial.\nFor cases of conjunctivitis caused by a gonococcal\norganism, a physician may prescribe an intramuscularinjection of ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and a topical antibi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 903Conjunctivitis\nThis person has severe conjunctivitis, most likely caused\nby an allergic reaction.

Sexualpartners should also be treated.\nWith accompanying chlamydia infection, a topical\nantibiotic ointment containing erythromycin (Ilotycin)may be prescribed to be applied 1-2 times daily. In addi-tion, oral erythromycin or tetracycline therapy may beindicated for three to four weeks. Here again, sexualpartners should also be treated.\nAllergic conjunctivitis can be treated by removing\nthe allergic substance from a person’s environment, ifpossible; by applying cool compresses to the eye; and byadministering eye drops four to six times daily for fourdays. Also, the antihistamine diphenhydraminehydrochloride (Benadryl) may help to relieve itchy eyes.\nAlternative treatment\nConjunctivitis caused by gonococcal and chlamydial\ninfection usually requires conventional medical treat-ment. With bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis,however, alternative options can be helpful. Internalimmune enhancement with supplementation can aid inthe resolution of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis.Removal of the allergic agent is an essential step in treat-ing allergic conjunctivitis. As with any of the recom-mended treatments, however, if no improvement is seenwithin 48–72 hours, a physician should be consulted.Homeopathically, there are a number of acute reme-\ndies designed to treat conjunctivitis. These include Pul-\nsatilla (windflower, Pulsatilla nigricans ),Belladonna ,\nand eyebright ( Euphrasia officinalis ). Eye drops, pre-\npared with homeopathic remedies and/or herbs, can be agood substitute for pharmaceutical eye drops. Eye washescan also be made. Herbal eyewashes made with eyebright(1 tsp. dried herb steeped in 1 pint of boiling water) orchamomile ( Matricaria recutita ; 2–3 tsp in 1 pt of boiling\nwater) may be helpful. Eyewashes should be strained andcooled before use, and close attention should be paid tomake sure that any solution put into the eye is sterile.\nOther simple home remedies may help relieve the\ndiscomfort associated with conjunctivitis. A boric acideyewash can be used to clean and soothe the eyes. Awarm compress applied to the eyes for five to 10 minutesthree times a day can help relieve the discomfort of bac-terial and viral conjunctivitis. A cool compress or cool,damp tea bags placed on the eyes can ease the discomfortof allergic conjunctivitis.\nPrognosis\nIf treated properly, the prognosis for conjunctivitis is\ngood. Conjunctivitis caused by an allergic reactionshould clear up once the allergen is removed. However,allergic conjunctivitis will likely recur if the individualagain comes into contact with the particular allergen.Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or a virus, if treatedproperly, is usually resolved in 10–14 days. If there is norelief of symptoms in 48–72 hours, or there is moderateto severe eye pain , changes in vision, or the conjunctivi-\ntis is suspected to be caused by herpes simplex, a physi-cian should be notified immediately. If untreated or iftreatment fails and is not corrected, conjunctivitis maycause visual impairment by spreading to other parts of\nthe eye, such as the cornea.\nPrevention\nConjunctivitis can, in many cases, be prevented, or\nat least the course of the disease can be shortened by fol-lowing some simple practices.\n• Frequently wash hands using antiseptic soap, and use\nsingle-use towels during the disease to prevent spread-ing the infection.\n• Avoid chemical irritants and known allergens.• If in an area where welding occurs, use the proper pro-\ntective eye wear and screens to prevent damaging theeyes.\n• Use a clean tissue to remove discharge from eyes, and\nwash hands to prevent the spread of infection.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 904ConjunctivitisEyelid\nConjunctiva\nCornea\nLens\nConjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva, a thin,\ndelicate membrane that covers the eyeball and lines theeyelid.

    "title": "Constipation",
    "content": "Constipation\nDefinition\nConstipation is an acute or chronic condition in\nwhich bowel movements occur less often than usual orconsist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult topass. Bowel habits vary, but an adult who has not had abowel movement in three days or a child who has not hada bowel movement in four days is considered constipated.\nDescription\nConstipation is one of the most common medical\ncomplaints in the United States. Constipation can occurat any age, and is more common among individuals whoresist the urge to move their bowels at their body’s sig-nal. This often happens when children start school orenter daycare and feel shy about asking permission to usethe bathroom.\nConstipation is more common in women than in\nmen and is especially apt to occur during pregnancy .\nAge alone does not increase the frequency of constipa-tion, but elderly people (especially women) are morelikely to suffer from constipation.\nAlthough this condition is rarely serious, it can lead to:\n• bowel obstruction\n• chronic constipation• hemorrhoids (a mass of dilated veins in swollen tissue\naround the anus)\n• hernia (a protrusion of an organ through a tear in the\nmuscle wall)\n• spastic colitis ( irritable bowel syndrome , a condition\ncharacterized by alternating periods of diarrhea and\nconstipation)\n• laxative dependency\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 905ConstipationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 905Chronic constipation may be a symptom of colorec-\ntal cancer , depression, diabetes, diverticulosis (small\npouches in the muscles of the large intestine), lead poi-\nsoning , or Parkinson’s disease .\nIn someone who is elderly or disabled, constipation\nmay be a symptom of bowel impaction, a more seriouscondition in which feces are trapped in the lower part ofthe large intestine. A doctor should be called if an elderlyor disabled person is constipated for a week or more or ifa child seems to be constipated.\nA doctor should be notified whenever constipation\noccurs after starting a new prescription, vitamin, or min-eral supplement or is accompanied by blood in the stools,changes in bowel patterns, or fever and abdominal pain .\nCauses and symptoms\nConstipation usually results from not getting enough\nexercise , not drinking enough water, or from a diet that\ndoes not include an adequate amount of fiber-rich foodslike beans, bran cereals, fruits, raw vegetables, rice, andwhole-grain breads.\nOther causes of constipation include anal fissure (a\ntear or crack in the lining of the anus); chronic kidney\nfailure ; colon or rectal cancer ; depression; hypercal-\ncemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood);\nhypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland); illness\nrequiring complete bed rest; irritable bowel syndrome;and stress .\nConstipation can also be a side effect of:\n• aluminum salts in antacids\n• antihistamines\n• antipsychotic drugs\n• aspirin• belladonna ( Atopa belladonna, source of atropine, a\nmedication used to relieve spasms and dilate the pupilsof the eye)\n• beta blockers (medications used to stabilize irregular\nheartbeat, lower high blood pressure, reduce chest pain)\n• blood pressure medications\n• calcium channel blockers (medication prescribed to\ntreat high blood pressure, chest pain, some types ofirregular heartbeat and stroke , and some non-cardiac\ndiseases)\n• diuretics (drugs that promote the formation and secre-\ntion of urine)\n• iron or calcium supplements• narcotics (potentially addictive drugs that relieve pain\nand cause mood changes)• tricyclic antidepressants (medications prescribed to\ntreat chronic pain, depression, headaches, and other ill-nesses)\nAn adult who is constipated may feel bloated, have a\nheadache , swollen abdomen, or pass rock-like feces; or\nstrain, bleed, or feel pain during bowel movements. Aconstipated baby may strain, cry, draw the legs towardthe abdomen, or arch the back when having a bowelmovement.\nDiagnosis\nEveryone becomes constipated once in a while, but a\ndoctor should be notified if significant changes in bowelpatterns last for more than a week or if symptoms contin-ue more than three weeks after increasing activity andfiber and fluid intake.\nThe patient’s observations and medical history help\na primary care physician diagnose constipation. The doc-tor uses his fingers to see if there is a hardened mass inthe abdomen, and may perform a rectal examination .\nOther diagnostic procedures include a barium enema ,\nwhich reveals blockage inside the intestine; laboratoryanalysis of blood and stool samples for internal bleedingor other symptoms of systemic disease; and a sigmoi-\ndoscopy (examination of the sigmoid area of the colon\nwith a flexible tube equipped with a magnifying lens).\nPhysical and psychological assessments and a\ndetailed history of bowel habits are especially importantwhen an elderly person complains of constipation.\nTreatment\nIf changes in diet and activity fail to relieve occa-\nsional constipation, an over-the-counter laxative may beused for a few days. Preparations that soften stools or addbulk (bran, psyllium) work more slowly but are saferthan Epsom salts and other harsh laxatives or herbal lax-\natives containing senna ( Cassia senna ) or buckthorn\n(Rhamnus purshianna ), which can harm the nerves and\nlining of the colon.\nA woman who is pregnant should never use a laxa-\ntive. Neither should anyone who is experiencing abdomi-nal pain, nausea, or vomiting.\nA warm-water or mineral oil enema can relieve con-\nstipation, and a non-digestible sugar (lactulose) or spe-cial electrolyte solution is recommended for adults andolder children with stubborn symptoms.\nIf a patient has an impacted bowel, the doctor inserts\na gloved finger into the rectum and gently dislodges thehardened feces.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 906ConstipationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 906Alternative treatment\nInitially, alternative practitioners will suggest that\nthe patient drink an adequate amount of water each day(six to eight glasses), exercise on a regular basis, and eata diet high in soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibersinclude pectin, flax, and gums; insoluble fibers includepsyllium and brans from grains like wheat and oats.Fresh fruits and vegetables contain both soluble andinsoluble fibers. Castor oil, applied topically to theabdomen and covered by a heat source (a heating pad orhot water bottle), can help relieve constipation whenused nightly for 20–30 minutes.\nAcupressure\nThis needleless form of acupuncture is said to relax\nthe abdomen, ease discomfort, and stimulate regular bowelmovements when diet and exercise fail to do so. After lyingdown, the patient closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.For two minutes, he applies gentle fingertip pressure to apoint about two and one-half inches below the navel.\nAccupressure can also be applied to the outer edges\nof one elbow crease and maintained for 30 secondsbefore pressing the crease of the other elbow. This shouldbe done three times a day to relieve constipation.\nAromatherapy\nSix drops of rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) and\nsix drops of thyme ( Thymus spp.) diluted by 1 oz of\nalmond oil, olive oil, or another carrier oil can relieveconstipation when used to massage the abdomen.\nHerbal therapy\nA variety of herbal therapies can be useful in the\ntreatment of constipation. Several herbs, includingchamomile ( Matricaria recutita ), dandelion ( Taraxacum\nmongolicum ), and burdock ( Arctium lappa ), act as bit-\nters, stimulating the movement of the digestive andexcretory systems. There are also “laxative” herbs thatassist with bowel movement. Two of these are senna(Cassia senna ) and buckthorn ( Rhamnus purshiana ).\nThese “laxative” herbs are stronger acting on eliminationthan bitters and can sometimes cause cramping (mixingthem with a calming herb like fennel or caraway can helpreduce cramping). Both senna and buckthorn are power-ful herbs that are best used with direction from an experi-enced practitioner, since they can have adverse sideeffects and the patient may become dependent on them.\nHomeopathy\nHomeopathy also can offer assistance with consti-\npation. There are acute remedies for constipation that canbe found in one of the many home remedy books on\nhomeopathic medicine. A constitutional prescription alsocan help rebalance someone who is struggling with con-stipation.\nMassage\nMassaging the leg from knee to hip in the morning,\nat night, and before trying to move the bowels is said torelieve constipation. There is also a specific Swedishmassage technique that can help relieve constipation.\nYoga\nThe knee-chest position, said to relieve gas and stim-\nulate abdominal organs, involves:\n• standing straight with arms at the sides• lifting the right knee toward the chest• grasping the right ankle with the left hand• pulling the leg as close to the chest as possible• holding the position for about eight seconds• repeating these steps with the left leg\nThe cobra position, which can be repeated as many\nas four time a day, involves:\n• lying on the stomach with legs together\n• placing the palms just below the shoulders, holding\nelbows close to the body\n• inhaling, then lifting the head (face forward) and chest\noff the floor\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 907Constipation\nTransverse colon\nDescending colonStool\nSigmoid colon\nRectum\nConstipation is an acute or chronic condition in which\nbowel movements occur less often than usual or consist ofhard, dry stools that are painful or difficult to pass.

Consumption of 30 grams of fiber and between sixand eight glasses of water each day can generally preventconstipation.\nThirty-five grams of fiber a day (an amount equal to\nfive servings of fruits and vegetables, and a large bowl ofhigh-fiber cereal) can relieve constipation.\nDaily use of 500 mg vitamin C and 400 mg magne-\nsium can prevent constipation. If symptoms do occur,each dosage can be increased by 100 mg a day, up to amaximum of 5,000 mg vitamin C and 1,000 mg magne-sium.

    "title": "Contact dermatitis",
    "content": "Contact dermatitis\nDefinition\nContact dermatitis is the name for any skin inflam-\nmation that occurs when the skin’s surface comes in con-tact with a substance originating outside the body. Thereare two kinds of contact dermatitis, irritant and allergic.\nDescription\nThousands of natural and man-made substances can\ncause contact dermatitis, which is the most common skincondition requiring medical attention and the foremostsource of work-related disease. Florists, domestic work-ers, hairdressers, food preparers, and employees inindustry, construction, and health care are the peoplemost at risk of contracting work-related contact dermati-tis. Americans spend roughly $300 million a year in theirquest for relief from contact dermatitis, not counting theconsiderable sums devoted by governments and business-es to regulating and policing the use of skin-threateningchemicals in the workplace. But exactly how many peo-ple suffer from contact dermatitis remains unclear; a 1997article in the Journal of the American Medical Associa-\ntionnotes that figures ranging from 1% to 15% have been\nput forward for Western industrial nations.\nCauses and symptoms\nIrritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is the more com-\nmonly reported of the two kinds of contact dermatitis,and is seen in about 80% of cases. It can be caused bysoaps, detergents, solvents, adhesives, fiberglass, andother substances that are able to directly injure the skin.Most attacks are slight and confined to the hands andforearms, but can affect any part of the body that comes\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 908Contact dermatitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 908in contact with an irritating substance. The symptoms\ncan take many forms: redness, itching , crusting,\nswelling, blistering, oozing, dryness, scaliness, thicken-ing of the skin, and a feeling of warmth at the site of con-tact. In extreme cases, severe blistering can occur andopen sores can form. Jobs that require frequent skinexposure to water, such as hairdressing and food prepara-tion, can make the skin more susceptible to ICD.\nAllergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results when\nrepeated exposure to an allergen (an allergy-causing sub-stance) triggers an immune response that inflames theskin. Tens of thousands of drugs, pesticides, cosmetics,food additives, commercial chemicals, and other sub-stances have been identified as potential allergens. Fewerthan 30, however, are responsible the majority of ACDcases. Common culprits include poison ivy, poison oak,and poison sumac; fragrances and preservatives in cosmet-ics and personal care products; latex items such as glovesand condoms; and formaldehyde. Many people find thatthey are allergic to the nickel in inexpensive jewelry. ACDis usually confined to the area of skin that comes in contactwith the allergen, typically the hands or face. Symptomsrange from mild to severe and resemble those of ICD; apatch test may be needed to determine which kind of con-tact dermatitis a person is suffering from.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis begins with a physical examination and\nasking the patient questions about his or her health anddaily activities. When contact dermatitis is suspected, thedoctor attempts to learn as much as possible about thepatient’s hobbies, workplace duties, use of medicationsand cosmetics, etc.—anything that might shed light onthe source of the disease. In some cases, an examinationof the home or workplace is undertaken. If the dermatitisis mild, responds well to treatment, and does not recur,ordinarily the investigation is at an end. More difficultcases require patch testing to identify the allergen.\nTwo methods of patch testing are currently used. The\nmost widely used method, the Finn chamber method,employs a multiwell, aluminum patch. Each well is filledwith a small amount of the allergen being tested and thepatch is taped to normal skin on the patient’s upper back.After 48 hours, the patch is removed and an initial readingis taken. A second reading is made a few days later. Thesecond method of patch testing involves applying a smallamount of the test substance to directly to normal skinand covering it with a dressing that keeps air out andkeeps the test substance in (occlusive dressing). After 48hours, the dressing is taken off to see if a reaction hasoccurred. Identifying the allergen may require repeatedtesting, can take weeks or months, and is not always suc-cessful. Moreover, patch testing works only with ACD,\nthough it is considered an essential step in ruling out ICD.\nTreatment\nThe best treatment for contact dermatitis is to identify\nthe allergen or irritating substance and avoid further con-tact with it. If the culprit is, for instance, a cosmetic, avoid-ance is a simple matter, but in some situations, such as anallergy to an essential workplace chemical for which nosubstitute can be found, avoidance may be impossible orforce the sufferer to find new work or make other drasticchanges in his or her life. Barrier creams and protectiveclothing such as gloves, masks, and long-sleeved shirts areways of coping with contact dermatitis when avoidance isimpossible, though they are not always effective.\nFor the symptoms themselves, treatments in mild\ncases include cool compresses and nonprescriptionlotions and ointments. When the symptoms are severe,corticosteroids applied to the skin or taken orally are\nused. Contact dermatitis that leads to a bacterial skininfection is treated with antibiotics .\nAlternative treatment\nHerbal remedies have been used for centuries to\ntreat skin disorders including contact dermatitis. Anexperienced herbalist can recommend the remedies that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 909Contact dermatitis\nThe abdomen of a male patient afflicted with contact der-\nmatitis, triggered by an allergic reaction to a nickel beltbuckle.

It is taken internally as a teaor tincture (a concentrated herbal extract prepared withalcohol).\n• Calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) is a natural antiseptic\nand anti-inflammatory agent. It is applied topically in alotion, ointment, or oil to the affected area.\n• Aloe ( Aloe barbadensis ) soothes skin irritations. The\ngel is applied topically to the affected area.\nA homeopath treating a patient with contact dermati-\ntis will do a thorough investigation of the individual’s his-tory and exposures before prescribing a remedy. Onehomeopathic remedy commonly prescribed to relieve theitching associated with contact dermatitis is Rhus toxico-\ndendron taken internally three to four times daily.\nPoison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are common\nculprits in cases of allergic contact dermatitis. Followingexposure to these plants, rash development may be prevent-ed by washing the area with soap and water within 15 min-utes of exposure. The leaves of jewelweed ( Impatiens spp.),\nwhich often grows near poison ivy, may neutralize the poi-son-ivy allergen if rubbed on the skin right after contact.Several topical remedies may help relieve the itching asso-ciated with allergic contact dermatitis, including the juiceof plantain leaves ( Plantago major ); a paste made of equal\nparts of green clay and goldenseal root ( Hydrastis\ncanadensis ); a paste made of salt, water, clay, and pepper-\nmint ( Mentha piperita ) oil; and calamine lotion.\nPrognosis\nIf the offending substance is promptly identified and\navoided, the chances of a quick and complete recoveryare excellent.

There are different kinds of\nbirth control that act at different points in the process.\nPurpose\nEvery month, a woman’s body begins the process\nthat can potentially lead to pregnancy. An egg (ovum)matures, the mucus that is secreted by the cervix (a cylin-drical-shaped organ at the lower end of the uterus)changes to be more inviting to sperm, and the lining ofthe uterus grows in preparation for receiving a fertilizedegg. Any woman who wants to prevent pregnancy mustuse a reliable form of birth control.\nBirth control (contraception) is designed to interfere\nwith the normal process and prevent the pregnancy thatcould result. There are different kinds of birth controlthat act at different points in the process, from ovulation,through fertilization, to implantation. Each method hasits own side effects and risks. Some methods are morereliable than others.\nAlthough there are many different types of birth\ncontrol, they can be divided into a few groups based onhow they work. These groups include:\n• Hormonal methods—These use medications (hor-\nmones) to prevent ovulation. Hormonal methodsinclude birth control pills ( oral contraceptives ), Depo\nProvera injections and Norplant.\n• Barrier methods—These methods work by preventing\nthe sperm from getting to and fertilizing the egg. Barri-er methods include the condom , diaphragm, and cervi-\ncal cap. The condom is the only form of birth controlthat also protects against sexually transmitted dis-\neases , including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS ).\n• Spermicides—These medications kill sperm on con-\ntact. Most spermicides contain nonoxynyl-9. Spermi-cides come in many different forms such as jelly, foam,tablets, and even a transparent film. All are placed inthe vagina. Spermicides work best when they are usedat the same time as a barrier method.\n• Intrauterine devices—Intrauterine contraceptive\ndevices (IUDs) are inserted into the uterus, where theystay from one to 10 years. An IUD prevents the fertil-\nized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus, andmay have other effects as well.\n• Tubal sterilization—Tubal sterilization is a permanent\nform of contraception for women. Each fallopian tubeis either tied or burned closed. The sperm cannot reachthe egg, and the egg cannot travel to the uterus.\n• Vasectomy—is the male form of sterilization, and\nshould also be considered permanent. In vasectomy ,\nthe vas defrens, the tiny tubes that carry the sperm intothe semen, are cut and tied off. Thus, no sperm can getinto the semen.\nUnfortunately, there is no perfect form of birth con-\ntrol. Only abstinence (not having sexual intercourse) canprotect against unwanted pregnancy with 100% reliability.The failure rates, which means the rates of pregnancy, formost forms of birth control are quite low. However, someforms of birth control are more difficult or inconvenient touse than others. In actual practice, the birth control meth-ods that are more difficult or inconvenient have muchhigher failure rates because they are not used faithfully.\nDescription\nAll the different forms of birth control have one thing\nin common. They are only effective if used faithfully.Birth control pills will work only if taken every day; the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 911Contraception\nVarious types of contraception.

The same is true for condoms andthe cervical cap. Some methods are automatically work-ing every day, no matter what. These methods includeDepo Provera, Norplant, the IUD, and tubal sterilization.\nThere are many different ways to use birth control.\nThey can be divided into several groups:\n• By mouth (oral)—Birth control pills must be taken by\nmouth every day.\n• Injected—Depo Provera is a hormonal medication that\nis given by injection every three months.\n• Implanted—Norplant is a long-acting hormonal form\nof birth control that is implanted under the skin of theupper arm.\n• Vaginal—Spermicides and barrier methods work in the\nvagina.\n• Intra-uterine—The IUD is inserted into the uterus.\n• Surgical—Tubal sterilization is a form of surgery. A\ndoctor must perform the procedure in a hospital or sur-gical clinic. Many women need general anesthesia.\nThe methods of birth control differ from each other\nin the timing of when they are used. Some methods ofbirth control must be used specifically at the time of sex-ual intercourse (condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, sper-micides). All other methods of birth control must beworking all the time to provide protection (hormonalmethods, IUDs, tubal sterilization).\nPrecautions\nThere are risks associated with some forms of birth\ncontrol. Some of the risks of each method are listedbelow:\n• Birth control pills—The hormone (estrogen) in birth\ncontrol pills can increase the risk of heart attack in\nwomen over 40 who smoke.\n• IUD—The IUD can increase the risk of serious pelvic\ninfection. The IUD can also injure the uterus by pokinginto or through the uterine wall. Surgery might be need-ed to fix this.\n• Tubal sterilization—“Tying the tubes” is a surgical pro-\ncedure and has all the risks of any other surgery, includ-ing the risks of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding.\nPreparation\nNo specific preparation is needed before using con-\ntraception. However, a woman must be sure that she isnot already pregnant before using a hormonal method orhaving an IUD placed.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is needed.\nRisks\nMany methods of birth control have side effects.\nKnowing the side effects can help a woman to determinewhich method of birth control is right for her.\n• Hormonal methods—The hormones in birth control\npills, Depo Provera, and Norplant can cause changes inmenstrual periods, changes in mood, weight gain, acne ,\nand headaches. In addition, it may take many months tobegin ovulating again once a woman stops using DepoProvera or Norplant.\n• Barrier methods—A woman must insert the diaphragm\nin just the right way to be sure that it works properly.Some women get more urinary tract infections if theyuse a diaphragm. This is because the diaphragm canpress against the urethra, the tube that connects thebladder to the outside.\n• Spermicides—Some women and men are allergic to\nspermicides or find them irritating to the skin.\n• IUD—The IUD is a foreign body that stays inside the\nuterus, and the uterus tries to get it out.

    "content": "Contractures\nDefinition\nContractures are the chronic loss of joint motion due\nto structural changes in non-bony tissue. These non-bonytissues include muscles, ligaments, and tendons.\nDescription\nContractures can occur at any joint of the body. This\njoint dysfunction may be a result of immobilization from\ninjury or disease; nerve injury, such as spinal cord dam-age and stroke ; or muscle, tendon, or ligament disease.KEY TERMS\nFallopian tubes —The thin tubes that connect the\novary to the uterus. Ova (eggs) travel from theovary to the uterus. If the egg has been fertilized, itcan implant in the uterus.\nFertilization —The joining of the sperm and the\negg; conception.\nImplantation —The process in which the fertilized\negg embeds itself in the wall of the uterus.\nOvulation —The release of an egg (ovum) from the\novary.Causes and symptoms\nThere are a number of pathologies and diseases that\ncan lead to joint contractures. The primary causes result-ing in a joint contraction are muscle imbalance, pain ,\nprolonged bed rest, and immobilization. Because of thefrequency of fractures and surgery, immobilization is\nthe most frequent cause of joint contractures. Symptomsinclude a significant loss of motion to any specific jointthat results in immobility. If the contracture is of a signif-icant degree, pain can result even without any voluntaryjoint movement.\nDiagnosis\nManual testing of joint mobility by a healthcare pro-\nfessional skilled in joint mobilization techniques (e.g. aphysical therapist) will identify indications of restrictedstructures within the joint. Measuring the motion of thejoint with a device termed a “goniometer” can be usefulif the decrease of motion can be shown to be a provenresult of a joint contracture. X rays can be of some bene-fit in the diagnosis of contractures, because a visibledecrease in joint space may indicate a tight, contractedjoint. Most physicians will make the diagnosis after athorough physical examination involving physical and\nmanual testing of the joint motion.\nTreatment\nManual techniques\nJoint mobilization and stretching of soft tissues is a\ncommon technique used to increase joint elasticity.Structures are stretched in similar directions to thosewhich take place upon normal joint motion. Somehealthcare professionals may use some form of heat priorto the stretching and mobilization. If appropriate, exer-\ncisemay follow manual techniques to help maintain the\nadditional motion achieved.\nMechanical techniques\nDevices known as continuous passive motion\nmachines are very popular, especially following surgeryof joints. Continuous passive motion machines (CPM)are specifically adjusted to each individual’s need. Thismethod is administered within the first 24–72 hours afterthe injury or surgery. The joint is mechanically movedthrough the patient’s tolerable motion. CPM machineshave been proved to accelerate the return motion process,allowing patients more function in less time.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 913ContracturesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 913Casting or splinting\nCasting or splinting techniques are used to provide a\nconstant stretch to the soft tissues surrounding a joint. Itis most effective when used to increase motion of a jointfrom prolonged immobilization. It is also popular fortreating contractures resulting from an increase in muscletone from nerve injury. After an initial holding cast isapplied for seven to 10 days, a series of positional castsare applied at weekly intervals. Before the application ofeach new cast, the joint is moved as much as can be toler-ated by the patient, and measured by a goniometer. Whenas much motion as possible is obtained after stretching,another final cast is applied to maintain the newlyacquired motion.\nSurgery\nIn some cases the contracture may be severe and not\nrespond to conservative treatment. In this event, manipu-lation of the joint under a general anesthesia may be nec-essary.\nAlternative treatment\nIn some areas of the body, chiropractic techniques\nhave been found to be useful to improve motion. Mas-\nsage therapy can be beneficial by promoting additional\ncirculation to joint structures, causing better elasticity.Yoga can help prevent as well as rehabilitate a contrac-\nture and can facilitate the return of joint mobility.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis of contractures will depend upon the\ncause of the contracture.

    "title": "Cooling treatments",
    "content": "Cooling treatments\nDefinition\nCooling treatments lower body temperature in order\nto relieve pain , swelling, constriction of blood vessels,\nand to decrease the liklihood of cellular damage by slow-ing the metabolism. Sponge baths, cold compresses, andcold packs are all wet cooling treatments. Dry treat-ments, such as ice bags and chemical cold packs, are alsoused to lower body temperature.\nPurpose\nThe most common reason for cooling a body is\nfever or hyperthermia (extremely high fever). The body\ncan sustain temperatures up to 104°F (40°C) with rela-tive safety; however, when temperatures rise above104°F (40°C), damage to the brain, muscles, blood, andkidneys is increasingly likely. Cooling treatments arealso applied immediately following sprains, bruises ,\nburns , eye injuries, and muscle spasms to help alleviate\nthe resulting swelling, pain, and discoloration of the skin.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 914Cooling treatmentsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 914Cooling treatments slow chemical reactions within\nthe body. For this reason, cooling tissues below normaltemperature (98.6°F/37°C) can prevent injury from inad-equate oxygen or nutrition . Cold water drowning vic-\ntims suffering from hypothermia (cooling of the body\nbelow its normal temperature) have been successfullyresuscitated after long periods underwater without med-ical complications because of this effect. For the past 40years, heart surgeons have been experimenting withhypothermia to protect tissues from lack of blood circu-lation during an operation. Neurosurgeons are also work-ing with hypothermia to protect the very sensitive braintissues during periods of absent or reduced blood flow.\nDescription\nDepending on the medical need, various cooling\nmethods are used.\n• Cold packs and ice bags are placed on a localized site\nand provide topical relief. These compresses should becovered with a waterproof material to protect the skin.Repeated treatments produce the desired pain andswelling relief.\n• Cold treatments are placed on the groin and under the\narms to treat hyperthermia. Treatments are refreshedperiodically until the appropriate temperature is attained.\n• A tepid sponge bath relieves fever without cooling the\nbody too fast. Eighty degrees Farenheit is still 20°Fbelow body temperature and yet warm enough not todrive blood from the skin, thereby preventing the cool-ing from getting to the body’s core. Limbs are bathedfirst and then the chest, abdomen, back, and buttocks.\n• Perfusion of isolated regions like the brain by using\ncooled blood is an experimental treatment, offeringpromising results for the treatment of stroke.\nPreparation\nTopical treatments are prepared with ice, cold water\n(59°F/15°C), and chemical cold packs. Tepid bathsshould be 80–93°F (26.7–34°C).\nRisks\nSmall children, adults with circulation problems, and\nthe elderly are all at risk of tissue damage. Rapid coolingcauses chills, which in effect raise the body’s temperatureby raising its metabolism.

Oneof the many causes of anemia is destruction of red bloodcells, a process called hemolysis ( hemo means blood and\nlysis means disintegration). A simple blood count\ndetects anemia. Even the test done before a blood dona-tion can identify anemia. To detect hemolysis requiresother tests. The Coombs’ tests are conducted in order todetermine the cause of anemia.\nOne characteristic of hemolysis is the autoimmune\nresponse against the body’s red blood cells. Instead ofprotecting the body from outside agents, the immunesystem attacks parts of its own body with a deluge ofantibodies. Autoimmunity is thought to be the cause ofmany collagen-vascular diseases, including rheumatoid\narthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus . It is also\nthe cause of the autoimmune hemolytic anemias . The\nCoombs’ tests detect the antibodies responsible for thedestruction of the red blood cells.\nCauses of autoimmune hemolytic anemia include:\n• drugs such as penicillin, methyldopa (lowers blood\npressure), and quinidine (treats heart rhythm distur-bances)\n• cancers of the lymph system—Hodgkin’s disease and\nlymphomas\n• virus infections• collagen-vascular diseases\n• mismatched blood transfusions• Rh incompatibility between a mother and fetus.

A direct Coombs’ test\ndetects the two different antigens that might inducehemolysis in the patient’s red blood cells. An indirectCoombs’ test looks for antibodies to someone else’s redblood cells in the patient’s serum (the blood without thecells).

In fact, about 85% of patients diagnosed\nwith cor pulmonale have COPD. Chronic bronchitis and\nemphysema are types of COPD. High blood pressure in\nthe blood vessels of the lungs ( pulmonary hypertension )\ncauses the enlargement of the right ventricle. In additionto COPD, cor pulmonale may also be caused by lung dis-eases, such as cystic fibrosis ,pulmonary embolism, and\npneumoconiosis. Loss of lung tissue after lung surgery\nor certain chest-wall disturbances can produce cor pul-monale, as can neuromuscular diseases, such as muscu-\nlar dystrophy . A large pulmonary thromboembolism\n(blood clot) may lead to acute cor pulmonale.\nCauses and symptoms\nAny respiratory disease or malfunction that affects\nthe circulatory system of the lungs may lead to cor pul-monale. These circulatory changes cause the right ventri-cle to compensate for the extra work required to pumpblood through the lungs. The right ventricle has thinwalls and is crescent-shaped. The resulting pressurecauses the right ventricle to dilate and bulge, eventuallyleading to its failure.\nCor pulmonale should be expected in any patient\nwith COPD and other respiratory or neuromuscular dis-eases. Initial symptoms of cor pulmonale may actuallyreflect those of the underlying disease. These mayinclude chronic coughing, wheezing , weakness, fatigue ,\nand shortness of breath . Edema (abnormal buildup of\nfluid), weakness, and discomfort in the upper chest maybe evident in cor pulmonale.\nDiagnosis\nAn electrocardiograph (EKG) will show signs such\nas frequent premature contractions in the atria or ventri-cles. Chest x rays may show enlargement of the rightdescending pulmonary artery. This sign, along with anenlarged main pulmonary artery, indicates pulmonaryartery hypertension in patients with COPD. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) is often the preferred method\nof diagnosis for cor pulmonale because it can clearlyshow and measure volume of the pulmonary arteries.Other tests used to support a diagnosis of cor pulmonalemay include arterial blood gas analysis , pulmonary\nfunction tests, and hematocrit .\nTreatment\nTreatment of cor pulmonale is aimed at increasing a\npatient’s exercise tolerance and improving oxygen levels\nof the arterial blood. Treatment is also aimed at theunderlying condition that is producing cor pulmonale.Common treatments include antibiotics for respiratoryKEY TERMS\nVentricle —A cavity, as in the brain or heart. The\nright ventricle of the heart drives blood from theheart into the pulmonary artery, which suppliesblood to the lungs.\ninfection; anticoagulants to reduce the risk of throm-\nboembolism; and digitalis, oxygen, and phlebotomy to\nreduce red blood cell count. A low-salt diet and restrictedfluids are often prescribed.\nAlternative treatment\nCo-management of the patient with cor pulmonale\nshould be coordinated between the medical doctor andthe alternative practitioner. The first step in treatment isto determine the cause of the condition and to evaluateall organ systems of the body. Dietary considerations, forexample, a low-salt diet and reduced fluid intake aimedat reducing the edema associated with cor pulmonale,can be supportive aspects of treatment.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for cor pulmonale is poor, particularly\nbecause it occurs late in the process of serious disease.\nPrevention\nCor pulmonale is best prevented by prevention of\nCOPD and other irreversible diseases that lead to heartfailure.

    "title": "Corneal abrasion",
    "content": "Corneal abrasion\nDefinition\nA corneal abrasion is a worn or scraped-off area of\nthe outer, clear layer of the eye (cornea).\nDescription\nThe cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer area of\nthe eye. It lies in front of the colored part of the eye (iris)and the black hole in the iris (pupil). The outermost layerof the eyeball consists of the cornea and the white part ofthe eye (sclera). A corneal abrasion is basically a superfi-cial cut or scrape on the cornea. A corneal abrasion is notas serious as a corneal ulcer, which is generally deeperand more severe than an abrasion.\nCauses and symptoms\nA corneal abrasion is usually the result of direct injury\nto the eye, often from a fingernail scratch, makeup brushes,contact lenses, foreign body, or even twigs. Patients oftencomplain of feeling a foreign body in their eye, and theymay have pain, sensitivity to light, or tearing.\nDiagnosis\nOphthalmologists and optometrists, who treat eye\ndisorders, are well qualified to diagnose corneal abra-sions. The doctor will check the patient’s vision (visualacuity) in both eyes with an eye chart. A patient historywill also be taken, which may help to determine thecause of the abrasion. A slit lamp, which is basically amicroscope and light source, will allow the doctor to seethe abrasion. Fluorescein, a yellow dye, may be placedinto the eye to determine the extent of the abrasion. Thefluorescein will temporarily stain the affected area.\nTreatment\nThe cornea has a remarkable ability to heal itself, so\ntreatment is designed to minimize complications. If theabrasion is very small, the doctor might just suggest aneye lubricant and a follow-up visit the next day. A verysmall abrasion should heal in one to two days; othersusually in one week. However, to avoid a possible infec-tion, an antibiotic eye drop may be prescribed. Some-times additional eye drops may make the eye feel morecomfortable. Depending upon the extent of the abrasion,some doctors may patch the affected eye. It is veryimportant to go for the follow-up checkup to make surean infection does not occur. Use of contact lenses shouldnot be resumed without the doctor’s approval.\nPrognosis\nIn typical cases, the prognosis is good. The cornea\nwill heal itself, usually within several days. A very deepabrasion may lead to scarring. If the abrasion does notheal properly, a recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) mayresult months or even years later. The symptoms are thesame as for an abrasion (e.g., tearing, foreign body sensa-tion, and blurred vision), but it will keep occurring. Simi-lar or additional treatment for the RCE may be necessary.\nPrevention\nEveryone should wear eye protection whenever this\nis recommended. This should be standard practice whenusing power tools and playing certain sports. Gogglesshould even be worn when mowing the lawn, because atwig can be thrown upward toward the face. Contact lenswearers should be careful to follow their doctors’ instruc-tions on caring for and wearing their lenses. Ill-fitting ordirty lenses could lead to an abrasion, so patients shouldgo for their prescribed checkups.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 918Corneal abrasionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 918Resources\nBOOKS\nElkington, A.

    "title": "Corneal transplantation",
    "content": "Corneal transplantation\nDefinition\nIn corneal transplant, also known as keratoplasty, a\npatient’s damaged cornea is replaced by the cornea fromthe eye of a human cadaver. This is the single most com-mon type of human transplant surgery and has the high-est success rate. Eye banks acquire and store eyes fromdonor individuals largely to supply the need for trans-plant corneas.\nPurpose\nCorneal transplant is used when vision is lost in an\neye because the cornea has been damaged by disease ortraumatic injury. Some of the disease conditions thatmight require corneal transplant include the bulging out-ward of the cornea (keratoconus), a malfunction of theinner layer of the cornea (Fuchs’ dystrophy), and painfulswelling of the cornea (pseudophakic bullous keratopa-thy). Some of these conditions cause cloudiness of thecornea; others alter its natural curvature, which can alsoreduce the quality of vision.\nInjury to the cornea can occur because of chemical\nburns , mechanical trauma, or infection by viruses, bacte-\nria, fungi, or protozoa. The herpes virus produces one ofthe more common infections leading to corneal transplant.\nSurgery would only be used when damage to the\ncornea is too severe to be treated with corrective lenses.Occasionally, corneal transplant is combined with othertypes of eye surgery (such as cataract surgery ) to solve\nmultiple eye problems in one procedure.Precautions\nCorneal transplant is a very safe procedure that can\nbe performed on almost any patient who would benefitfrom it. Any active infection or inflammation of the eyeusually needs to be brought under control before surgerycan be performed.\nDescription\nThe cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the\nvery front of the eye. It is composed almost entirely of aspecial type of collagen. It normally contains no bloodvessels, but because it contains nerve endings, damage tothe cornea can be very painful.\nIn a corneal transplant, a disc of tissue is removed\nfrom the center of the eye and replaced by a correspond-ing disc from a donor eye. The circular incision is madeusing an instrument called a trephine. In one form ofcorneal transplant (penetrating keratoplasty), the discremoved is the entire thickness of the cornea and so is thereplacement disc. Over 90% of all corneal transplants inthe United States are of this type. In lamellar keratoplas-ty, on the other hand, only the outer layer of the cornea isremoved and replaced.\nThe donor cornea is attached with extremely fine\nsutures. Surgery can be performed under anesthesia that isconfined to one area of the body while the patient isawake (local anesthesia) or under anesthesia that placesthe entire body of the patient in a state of unconsciousness(general anesthesia.) Surgery requires 30–90 minutes.\nOver 40,000 corneal transplants are performed in the\nUnited States each year. Medicare reimbursement for acorneal transplant in one eye was about $1,200 in 1997.\nA less common but related procedure called epiker-\natophakia involves suturing the donor cornea directly\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 919Corneal transplantation\nA corneal transplant in progress.

The only tis-\nsue removed from the host is the extremely thin epithe-lial cell layer on the outside of the host cornea. There isno permanent damage to the host cornea, and this proce-dure can be reversed. It is usually employed in children.In adults, the use of contact lenses can usually achievethe same goals.\nPreparation\nNo special preparation for corneal transplant is need-\ned. Some eye surgeons may request the patient have a com-plete physical examination before surgery. The patient\nmay also be asked to skip breakfast on the day of surgery.\nAftercare\nCorneal transplant is often performed on an outpa-\ntient basis, although some patients need brief hospitaliza-tion after surgery. The patient will wear an eye patch atleast overnight. An eye shield or glasses must be worn toprotect the eye until the surgical wound has healed. Eyedrops will be prescribed for the patient to use for severalweeks after surgery. These drops include antibiotics to\nprevent infection as well as corticosteroids to reduce\ninflammation and prevent graft rejection.KEY TERMS\nCadaver —The human body after death.\nCataract —A condition of cloudiness of the lens of\nthe eye.\nCornea —The transparent layer of tissue at the very\nfront of the eye.\nCorticosteroids —Synthetic hormones widely used\nto fight inflammation.\nEpikeratophakia —A procedure in which the donor\ncornea is attached directly onto the host cornea.\nEpithelial cells —Cells that form a thin surface coat-\ning on the outside of a body structure.\nFibrous connective tissue —Dense tissue found in\nvarious parts of the body containing very few livingcells.\nFuchs’ dystrophy —A hereditary disease of the inner\nlayer of the cornea.

Vision will be somewhat blurry foras long as several months.\nSutures are often left in place for six months, and\noccasionally for as long as two years.\nRisks\nCorneal transplants are highly successful, with over\n90% of operations in United States achieving restorationof sight. However, there is always some risk associatedwith any surgery. Complications that can occur includeinfection, glaucoma ,retinal detachment , cataract for-\nmation, and rejection of the donor cornea.\nGraft rejection occurs in 5–30% of patients, a com-\nplication possible with any procedure involving tissuetransplantation from another person (allograft). Allograftrejection results from a reaction of the patient’s immunesystem to the donor tissue. Cell surface proteins calledhistocompatibility antigens trigger this reaction. Theseantigens are often associated with vascular tissue (bloodvessels) within the graft tissue. Since the cornea normal-ly contains no blood vessels, it experiences a very lowrate of rejection. Generally, blood typing and tissue typ-\ningare not needed in corneal transplants, and no close\nmatch between donor and recipient is required. Symp-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 920Corneal transplantationGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 920toms of rejection include persistent discomfort, sensitivi-\nty to light, redness, or a change in vision.\nIf a rejection reaction does occur, it can usually be\nblocked by steroid treatment. Rejection reactions maybecome noticeable within weeks after surgery, but maynot occur until 10 or even 20 years after the transplant.When full rejection does occur, the surgery will usuallyneed to be repeated.\nAlthough the cornea is not normally vascular, some\ncorneal diseases cause vascularization (the growth ofblood vessels) into the cornea. In patients with these con-ditions, careful testing of both donor and recipient is per-formed just as in transplantation of other organs and tis-sues such as hearts, kidneys, and bone marrow. In suchpatients, repeated surgery is sometimes necessary inorder to achieve a successful transplant.\nCornea donors are carefully screened. Individuals\nwith infectious diseases are not accepted as donors.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBoruchoff, S. Arthur, and Richard A. Thoft. “Keratoplasty:\nLamellar and Penetrating.” In The Cornea , ed.

    "title": "Corneal ulcers",
    "content": "Corneal ulcers\nDefinition\nThe cornea, the clear front part of the eye through\nwhich light passes, is subject to many infections and toinjury from exposure and from foreign objects . Infection\nand injury cause inflammation of the cornea—a condi-tion called keratitis . Tissue loss because of inflamma-\ntion produces an ulcer. The ulcer can either be centrallylocated, thus greatly affecting vision, or peripherallylocated. There are about 30,000 cases of bacterial cornealulcers in the United States each year.\nDescription\nThe most common cause of corneal ulcers is germs,\nbut most of them cannot invade a healthy cornea withadequate tears and a functioning eyelid. They gain accessbecause injury has impaired these defense mechanisms.A direct injury from a foreign object inoculates germsdirectly through the outer layer of the cornea, just as itdoes to the skin. A caustic chemical can inflame thecornea by itself or so damage it that germs can invade.Improper use of contact lenses has become a commoncause of corneal injury. Eyelid or tear function failure isthe other way to make the eye vulnerable to infection.Tears and the eyelid together wash the eye and preventforeign material from settling in. Tears contain enzymesand other substances to help protect against infection.Certain diseases dry up tear production, leaving thecornea dry and defenseless. Other diseases paralyze orweaken the eyelids so that they cannot effectively protectand cleanse the eyes.\nCauses and symptoms\nViruses, bacteria, fungi, and a protozoan called\nAcanthamoeba can all invade the cornea and damage it\nunder suitable conditions.\n• Bacteria from a common conjunctivitis (pink eye)\nrarely spread to the cornea, but can if untreated.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 921Corneal ulcers\nA close-up view of an ulcer on cornea.

One form of chlamydial infection is the leadingcause of blindness in developing countries and is knownas Egyptian ophthalmia or trachoma . Another type of\nChlamydia causes a sexually transmitted disease.\n• Other sexually transmitted diseases—for example,\nsyphilis—can affect the cornea.\nThe most common viruses to damage the cornea are\nadenoviruses and herpes viruses. Viral and fungal infec-tions are often caused by improper use of topical corti-\ncosteroids . If topical corticosteroids are used in a patient\nwith herpes simplex keratitis, the ulcer can get muchworse and blindness could result.\nSymptoms are obvious. The cornea is intensely sen-\nsitive, so corneal ulcers normally produce severe pain . If\nthe corneal ulcer is centrally located, vision is impairedor completely absent. Tearing is present and the eye isred. It hurts to look at bright lights.\nDiagnosis\nThe doctor will take a case history to try to deter-\nmine the cause of the ulcer. This can include improperuse of contact lenses; injury, such as a scratch from atwig; or severe dry eye. An instrument called a slit lampwill be used to examine the cornea. The slit lamp is amicroscope with a light source that magnifies the cornea,allowing the extent of the ulcer to be seen. Fluorescein, ayellow dye, may be used to illuminate further detail. If agerm is responsible for the ulcer, identification mayrequire scraping samples directly from the cornea, con-junctiva, and lids, and sending them to the laboratory.KEY TERMS\nFluorescein —A fluorescent chemical used to\nexamine the cornea.\nGerm —A disease-causing microorganism.\nInflammation —The body’s reaction to irritation.\nTopical corticosteroids —Cortisone and related\ndrugs used on the skin and in the eye, usually forallergic conditions.Treatment\nA corneal ulcer needs to be treated aggressively, as it\ncan result in loss of vision. The first step is to eliminateinfection. Broad spectrum antibiotics will be used\nbefore the lab results come back. Medications may thenbe changed to more specifically target the cause of theinfection. A combination of medications may be neces-sary. Patients should return for their follow-up visits sothat the doctor can monitor the healing process. Thecornea can heal from many insults, but if it remainsscarred, corneal transplantation may be necessary to\nrestore vision. If the corneal ulcer is large, hospitaliza-tion may be necessary.\nPrognosis\nTreated early enough, corneal infections will usually\nresolve, perhaps even without the formation of an ulcer.However, left untreated, infections can lead to ulcers andthe corneal ulcer can result in scarring or perforation ofthe cornea. Other problems may occur as well, includingglaucoma . Patients with certain systemic diseases that\nimpede healing (such as diabetes mellitus or rheuma-\ntoid arthritis ) may need more aggressive treatment. The\nlater the treatment, the more damage will be done and themore scarring will result. Corneal transplant is standardtreatment with a high probability of success.\nPrevention\nAttentive care of contact lenses will greatly reduce\nthe incidence of corneal damage and ulceration. Germsthat cause no problems in the mouth or on the hands candamage the eye, so contact lens wearers must wash theirhands before touching their lenses and must not use sali-va to moisten them. Tap water should not be used to rinsethe lenses. Contacts should be removed whenever thereis irritation and left out until the eyes are back to normal.It is not advisable to wear contact lenses while swim-ming or in hot tubs. Daily wear contact lenses have beenfound to be less of a risk than contacts for overnight wear(extended wear). Organisms have been cultured fromcontact lens cases, so the cases should be rinsed in hotwater and allowed to air dry. Cases should be replacedevery three months. Patients should follow their doctors’schedules for replacement of the contacts.\nEye protection in the workplace, or wherever tiny\nparticles are flying around, is essential. Ultraviolet (UV)coatings on glasses or sunglasses can help protect theeyes from the sun’s rays. Goggles with UV protectionshould be worn when skiing or in suntanning salons toprotect against UV rays.

    "content": "Corns and calluses\nDefinition\nA corn is a small, painful, raised bump on the outer\nskin layer. A callus is a rough, thickened patch of skin.\nDescription\nCorns and calluses are one of the three major foot\nproblems in the United States. The other two are footinfections and toenail problems. Corns and callusesaffect about 5% of the population.\nCorns usually appear on non-weight-bearing areas\nlike the outside of the little toe or the tops of other toes.Women have corns more often than men, probablybecause women wear high-heeled shoes and other shoesthat do not fit properly. Corns have hard cores shapedlike inverted pyramids. Sharp pain occurs whenever\ndownward pressure is applied, and a dull ache may befelt at other times.\nCalluses occur most often on the heels and balls of\nthe feet, the knees, and the palms of the hands. However,they can develop on any part of the body that is subject torepeated pressure or irritation. Calluses are usually morethan an inch wide—larger than corns. They generallydon’t hurt unless pressure is applied.Types of corns\nA hard corn is a compact lump with a thick core.\nHard corns usually form on the tops of the toes, on theoutside of the little toe, or on the sole of the foot.\nA soft corn is a small, inflamed patch of skin with a\nsmooth center. Soft corns usually appear between the toes.\nA seed corn is the least common type of corn.\nOccurring only on the heel or ball of the foot, a seed cornconsists of a circle of stiff skin surrounding a plug ofcholesterol.\nTypes of calluses\nA plantar callus, a callus that occurs on the sole of\nthe foot, has a white center. Hereditary calluses developwhere there is no apparent friction, run in families, andoccur most often in children.\nCauses and symptoms\nCorns and calluses form to prevent injury to skin\nthat is repeatedly pinched, rubbed, or irritated. The mostcommon causes are:\n• shoes that are too tight or too loose, or have very high\nheels\n• tight socks or stockings\n• deformed toes\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 923Corns and calluses\nCorns on toes.

Corns may be extremely soreand surrounded by inflamed, swollen skin.\nDiagnosis\nCorns can be recognized on sight. A family physi-\ncian or podiatrist may scrape skin off what seems to be acallus, but may actually be a wart. If the lesion is a wart,it will bleed. A callus will not bleed, but will revealanother layer of dead skin.\nTreatment\nCorns and calluses do not usually require medical\nattention unless the person who has them has diabetes\nmellitus , poor circulation, or other problems that make\nself-care difficult.\nTreatment should begin as soon as an abnormality\nappears. The first step is to identify and eliminate thesource of pressure. Placing moleskin pads over corns canrelieve pressure, and large wads of cotton, lamb’s wool,or moleskin can cushion calluses.\nUsing hydrocortisone creams or soaking feet in a\nsolution of Epsom salts and very warm water for at leastfive minutes a day before rubbing the area with a pumicestone will remove part or all of some calluses. Rubbingcorns just makes them hurt more.\nApplying petroleum jelly or lanolin-enriched hand\nlotion helps keep skin soft, but corn-removing ointmentsthat contain acid can damage healthy skin. They shouldnever be used by pregnant women or by people who arediabetic or who have poor circulation.KEY TERMS\nAyurveda —Ayurveda is a system of wholistic\nmedicine from India that aims to bring the individ-ual into harmony with nature.

In the body, bursae are located atplaces where friction might otherwise develop.It is important to see a doctor if the skin of a corn or\ncallus is cut, because it may become infected. If a corndischarges pus or clear fluid, it is infected. A familyphysician, podiatrist, or orthopedist may:\n• remove (debride) affected layers of skin• prescribe oral antibiotics to eliminate infection\n• drain pus from infected corns• inject cortisone into the affected area to decrease pain\nor inflammation\n• perform surgery to correct toe deformities or remove\nbits of bone\nAlternative treatment\nStanding and walking correctly can sometimes elim-\ninate excess foot pressure. Several types of bodyworkcan help correct body imbalances. Bodywork is a termused for any of a number of systems, including Aston-\nPatterning , the Feldenkrais method , and rolfing , that\nmanipulate the body through massage, movement educa-tion, or meditational techniques.\nAloe ( Aloe barbadensis ) cream is an effective skin\nsoftener, and two or three daily applications of calendu-la (Calendula officinalis ) salve can soften skin and pre-\nvent inflammation. One teaspoon of lemon juice mixedwith one teaspoon of dried chamomile ( Martricaria\nrecutita ) tea and one crushed garlic clove dissolves\nthickened skin.\nAn ayurvedic practitioner may recommend the fol-\nlowing treatment:\n• apply each day a paste made by combining one tea-\nspoon of aloe vera gel with half that amount of turmeric(Circuma longa )\n• bandage overnight• soak in warm water for 10 minutes every morning• massage gently with mustard ( Brassica cruciferae ) oil\nPrognosis\nMost corns and calluses disappear about three weeks\nafter the pressure that caused them is eliminated. Theyare apt to recur if the pressure returns.\nExtreme pain can change the way a person stands or\nwalks. Such changes can, in turn, cause pain in the ankle,back, hip, or knee.\nBursitis , a painful, inflamed fluid-filled sac, can\ndevelop beneath a corn. An ulcer or broken area within acorn can reach to the bone. Infection can have seriousconsequences for people who have diabetes or poor cir-culation.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 924Corns and callusesGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 924Prevention\nCorns and calluses can usually be prevented by avoid-\ning friction-causing activities and wearing shoes that fitproperly, are activity-appropriate, and are kept in goodrepair. Soles and heels that wear unevenly may indicate aneed for corrective footwear or special insoles. Socks andstockings should not cramp the toes. Gloves, kneepads,and other protective gear should also be worn as needed.\nFeet should be measured, while standing, whenever\nbuying new shoes. It is best to shop for shoes late in theday, when feet are likely to be swollen. It is also impor-tant to buy shoes with toe-wiggling room and to try newshoes on both feet.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Editors of Time-Life Books.

These grafts usually come fromthe patient’s own arteries and veins located in the leg,arm, or chest.\nPurpose\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery (also called\ncoronary artery bypass surgery, CABG, and bypass oper-ation) is performed to restore blood flow to the heart.This relieves chest pain and ischemia , improves the\npatient’s quality of life, and in some cases, prolongs thepatient’s life. The goals of the procedure are to enable thepatient to resume a normal lifestyle and to lower the riskof a heart attack .\nThe decision to perform coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery is a complex one, and there is some disagreementamong experts as to when it is indicated. Many expertsfeel that it has been performed too frequently in the Unit-ed States. According to the American Heart Association,appropriate candidates for coronary artery bypass graftsurgery include patients with blockages in at least threemajor coronary arteries, especially if the blockages are inarteries that feed the heart’s left ventricle; patients withangina so severe that even mild exertion causes chest\npain; and patients who cannot tolerate percutaneous trans-luminal coronary angioplasty and do not respond well to\ndrug therapy. It is well accepted that coronary arterybypass graft surgery is the treatment of choice for patientswith severe coronary artery disease (three or more dis-\neased arteries with impaired function in the left ventricle).\nPrecautions\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery should ideally\nbe postponed for three months after a heart attack. Patientsshould be medically stable before the surgery, if possible.\nDescription\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery builds a detour\naround one or more blocked coronary arteries with agraft from a healthy vein or artery. The graft goes aroundthe clogged artery (or arteries) to create new pathwaysfor oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart.\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery\nperformed in a hospital. The length of the proceduredepends upon the number of arteries being bypassed, but itgenerally  takes from four to six hours—sometimes longer.The average hospital stay is four to seven days. Full recov-ery from coronary artery bypass graft surgery takes three tofour months. Within four to six weeks, people with seden-tary office jobs can return to work; people with physicaljobs must wait longer and sometimes change careers.\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery is widely per-\nformed in the United States. The American Heart Associ-ation estimates that 573,000 coronary artery bypass graftsurgeries were performed on 363,000 patients in 1995.Seventy-four percent of these procedures were per-formed on men and 44% on men and women under theage of 65 (1995 data). The estimated average cost of thisprocedure in 1995 was $44,820.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 925Coronary artery bypass graft surgeryGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 925Procedure\nThe surgery team for coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery includes the cardiovascular surgeon, assisting sur-geons, a cardiovascular anesthesiologist, a perfusion tech-nologist (who operates the heart-lung machine), and spe-cially trained nurses. After general anesthesia is adminis-tered, the surgeon removes the veins or prepares the arter-ies for grafting. If the saphenous vein is to be used, a seriesof incisions are made in the patient’s thigh or calf. Morecommonly, a segment of the internal mammary artery willbe used and the incisions are made in the chest wall. Thesurgeon then makes an incision from the patient’s neck tonavel, saws through the breastbone, and retracts the ribcage open to expose the heart. The patient is connected toa heart-lung machine, also called a cardiopulmonarybypass pump, that cools the body to reduce the need foroxygen and takes over for the heart and lungs during theprocedure. The heart is then stopped and a cold solution ofpotassium-enriched normal saline is injected into the aor-tic root and the coronary arteries to lower the temperatureof the heart, which prevents damage to the tissue.\nNext, a small opening is made just below the block-\nage in the diseased coronary artery. Blood will be redirect-ed through this opening once the graft is sewn in place. If a\nleg vein is used, one end is connected to the coronaryartery and the other to the aorta. If a mammary artery isused, one end is connected to the coronary artery while theother remains attached to the aorta. The procedure isrepeated on as many coronary arteries as necessary. Mostpatients who have coronary artery bypass graft surgeryhave at least three grafts done during the procedure.\nElectric shocks start the heart pumping again after\nthe grafts have been completed. The heart-lung machineis turned off and the blood slowly returns to normal bodytemperature. After implanting pacing electrodes (if need-ed) and inserting a chest tube, the surgeon closes thechest cavity.\nSuccess rate of coronary artery bypass graft surgery\nAbout 90% of patients experience significant improve-\nments after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patientsexperience full relief from chest pain and resume their nor-mal activities in about 70% of the cases; the remaining20% experience partial relief. In 5–10% of coronary arterybypass graft surgeries, the bypass graft stops supplyingblood to the bypassed artery within one year.

Patients who have poorer results fromcoronary artery bypass graft surgery include those over theage of 70, those who have poor left ventricular function, orare undergoing a repeat surgery or other procedures con-currently, and those who continue smoking , do not treat\nhigh cholesterol or other coronary risk factors, or have\nanother debilitating disease.\nLong term, symptoms recur in only about 3–4% of\npatients per year. Five years after coronary artery bypassgraft surgery, survival expectancy is 90%, at 10 years it isabout 80%, at 15 years it is about 55%, and at 20 years itis about 40%.\nAngina recurs in about 40% of patients after about\n10 years. In most cases, it is less severe than before thesurgery and can be controlled by drug therapy. In patientswho have had vein grafts, 40% of the grafts are severelyobstructed 10 years after the procedure. Repeat coronaryartery bypass graft surgery may be necessary, and is usu-ally less successful than the first surgery.\nMinimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery\nThere are two new types of minimally invasive coro-\nnary artery bypass graft surgery: port-access coronaryartery bypass (also called PACAB or PortCAB) and min-imally invasive coronary artery bypass (also called MID-CAB). These procedures are minimally invasive becausethey do not require the neck-to-navel incision, sawingthrough the breastbone, or opening the rib cage to exposethe heart. Both procedures enable surgeons to work onthe coronary arteries through small chest holes calledports and other small incisions. Port-access coronaryartery bypass requires the use of a heart-lung machinebut minimally invasive coronary artery bypass does not.Advantages of these procedures over standard coronaryartery bypass graft surgery include a shorter hospitalstay, a shorter recovery period, and lower costs.\nPort-access coronary artery bypass enables surgeons\nto perform bypasses through smaller incisions. Using avideo monitor to view the procedure, the surgeon passesinstruments through ports in the patient’s chest to per-form the bypass. Mammary arteries or leg veins are usedfor the grafts. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypassis performed on a beating heart and is appropriate onlyfor bypasses of one or two arteries. Small ports are madein the patient’s chest, along with a small incision directlyover the coronary artery to be bypassed. Generally, thesurgeon uses a mammary artery for the bypass.\nEarly data on outcomes for port-access coronary artery\nbypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass arefavorable. Mortality rates with port-access coronary arterybypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are\nboth less than 3%—about the same as in standard coronaryartery bypass graft surgery. One clinical trial indicated thatsurvival at seven years was the same in minimally invasivecoronary artery bypass and standard coronary artery bypassgraft surgery, but that another intervention was necessaryfive times more often with minimally invasive coronaryartery bypass than with standard coronary artery bypassgraft surgery. The American Heart Association Council onCardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgery feels that both pro-cedures appear promising but that further study is needed.More data covering longer term outcomes are necessary inorder to fully assess these procedures.\nPreparation\nThe patient is usually admitted to the hospital the\nday before the coronary artery bypass graft surgery isscheduled. Coronary angiography has been previously\nperformed to show the surgeon where the arteries areblocked and where the grafts might best be positioned.The patient is given a blood-thinning drug—usuallyheparin—that helps to prevent blood clots. The eveningbefore the surgery, the patient showers with antisepticsoap and is shaved from chin to toes. After midnight,food and fluids are restricted. A sedative is prescribed onthe morning of surgery and sometimes the night before.Heart monitoring begins.\nAftercare\nThe patient recovers in a surgical intensive care unit\nfor at least the first two days after the surgery. He or she isconnected to chest and breathing tubes, a mechanical venti-lator, a heart monitor and other monitoring equipment, anda urinary catheter. The breathing tube and ventilator areusually removed within six hours of surgery, but the othertubes remain in place as long as the patient is in the inten-sive care unit. Drugs are prescribed to control pain and toprevent unwanted blood clotting. The patient is closelymonitored. Vital signs and other parameters, such as heartsounds and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterialblood, are checked frequently. The chest tube is checked toensure that it is draining properly. The patient is fed intra-venously for the first day or two. Daily doses of aspirin are\nstarted within six to 24 hours after the procedure. Chestphysiotherapy is started after the ventilator and breathingtube are removed. The therapy includes coughing, turningfrequently, and taking deep breaths. Other exercises will beencouraged to improve the patient’s circulation and preventcomplications due to prolonged bed rest.\nIf there are no complications, the patient begins to\nresume a normal routine around the second day. Thisincludes eating regular food, sitting up, and walking\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 927Coronary artery bypass graft surgeryGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 927around a little bit. Before being released from the hospi-\ntal, the patient usually spends a few days under observa-tion in a non-surgical unit. During this time, counseling isusually provided on eating right and starting a light exer-\nciseprogram to keep the heart healthy. Patients should eat\na lot of fruits, vegetables, grains, and non-fat or low-fatdairy products, and reduce fats to less than 30% of allcalories. An exercise program will usually be tailored forthe patient, who will be encouraged to participate in acardiac rehabilitation program where exercise will be\nsupervised by professionals. Cardiac rehabilitation pro-\ngrams, offered by hospitals and other organizations, mayalso include classes on heart-healthy living.\nFull recovery from coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery takes three to four months and is a gradualprocess. Upon release from the hospital, the patient willfeel weak because of the extended bed rest in the hospi-tal. Within a few weeks, the patient should begin to feelstronger.\nWhile the incision scar from coronary artery bypass\ngraft surgery heals, which takes one to two months, itmay be sore. The scar should not be bumped, scratched,or otherwise disturbed. An exercise test is often conduct-ed after the patient leaves the hospital to determine howeffective the surgery was and to confirm that progressiveexercise is safe.\nRisks\nCoronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery\nand patients may experience any of the complicationsassociated with major surgery.

    "content": "Coronary artery disease\nDefinition\nCoronary artery disease is a narrowing or blockage\nof the arteries and vessels that provide oxygen and nutri-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 928Coronary artery diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 928ents to the heart. It is caused by atherosclerosis , an accu-\nmulation of fatty materials on the inner linings of arter-ies. The resulting blockage restricts blood flow to theheart. When the blood flow is completely cut off, theresult is a heart attack .\nDescription\nCoronary artery disease, also called coronary heart\ndisease or heart disease, is the leading cause of death for\nboth men and women in the United States. According tothe American Heart Association, in 1995 one in every 4.8deaths in the United States was caused by coronary arterydisease. About every 29 seconds, one American will havea heart attack; about every minute, one American will diefrom a heart attack. Fourteen million Americans haveactive symptoms of coronary artery disease (heart attackor chest pains). Many millions more have silent coronarydisease, the first indication of which can be sudden death.\nCoronary artery disease occurs when the coronary\narteries become partially blocked or clogged. This block-age limits the flow of blood from the coronary arteries,which are the major arteries supplying oxygen-rich bloodto the heart. The coronary arteries expand when the heartis working harder and needs more oxygen. Arterieswould expand, for example, when a person is climbingstairs, exercising, or having sex. If the arteries are unableto expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardialischemia ). When the blockage is limited, chest pain or\npressure, called angina, may occur. When the blockage\ncuts off the flow of blood, the result is heart attack(myocardial infarction or heart muscle death).\nHealthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and\nslick. The artery walls are flexible and can expand to letmore blood through when the heart needs to work harder.The disease process in arteries is thought to begin withan injury to the linings and walls of the arteries. Thisinjury makes them susceptible to atherosclerosis andblood clots (thrombosis).\nCauses and symptoms\nCoronary artery disease is usually caused by athero-\nsclerosis. Cholesterol and other fatty substances accumu-late on the inner wall of the arteries. They attract fibroustissue, blood components, and calcium and harden intoartery-clogging plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques oftenform blood clots that can also block the coronary arteries(coronary thrombosis). Congenital defects and musclespasms can also block blood flow. Recent research indi-cates that infection from organisms such as chlamydiabacteria may be responsible for some cases of coronaryartery disease.A number of major contributing factors increase the\nrisk of developing coronary artery disease. Some of thesecan be changed and some cannot. People with more riskfactors are more likely to develop coronary artery disease.\nMajor risk factors\nMajor risk factors significantly increase the chance\nof developing coronary artery disease. Those that cannotbe changed are:\n• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery\ndisease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri-cans are also at increased risk because they experiencea higher rate of severe hypertension than whites do.\n• Sex—Men are more likely to have heart attacks than\nwomen are and to have them at a younger age. Over age60, however, women have coronary artery disease at arate equal to that of men.\n• Age—Men who are 45 years of age and older and\nwomen who are 55 years of age and older are morelikely to have coronary artery disease. Occasionally,coronary disease may strike a person in the 30s. Olderpeople (those over 65) are more likely to die of a heartattack. Older women are twice as likely as older men todie within a few weeks of a heart attack.\nMajor risk factors that can be changed are:\n• Smoking—Smoking increases both the chance of\ndeveloping coronary artery disease and the chance ofdying from it. Smokers are two to four times more like-ly than are non-smokers to die of sudden heart attack.They are more than twice as likely as non-smokers tohave a heart attack. They are also more likely to diewithin an hour of a heart attack. Second hand smokemay also increase risk.\n• High cholesterol—Dietary sources of cholesterol are\nmeat, eggs, and other animal products. The body alsoproduces it. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect one’sblood cholesterol. Total blood cholesterol is consideredhigh at levels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein(LDL cholesterol) begin at 130–159 mg/dL, dependingon other risk factors. Risk of developing coronaryartery disease increases steadily as blood cholesterollevels increase above 160 mg/dL. When a person hasother risk factors, the risk multiplies.\n• High blood pressure—High blood pressure makes the\nheart work harder and weakens it over time. It increasesthe risk of heart attack, stroke , kidney failure, and con-\ngestive heart failure . A blood pressure of 140 over 90\nor above is considered high. As the numbers rise, highblood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild) to Stage 4(very severe). In combination with obesity ,smoking ,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 929Coronary artery diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 929high cholesterol , or diabetes, high blood pressure rais-\nes the risk of heart attack or stroke several times.\n• Lack of physical activity—Lack of exercise increases\nthe risk of coronary artery disease. Even modest physi-cal activity, like walking, is beneficial if done regularly.\n• Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing coronary\nartery disease is seriously increased for diabetics. Morethan 80% of diabetics die of some type of heart orblood vessel disease.\nContributing risk factors\nContributing risk factors have been linked to coro-\nnary artery disease, but their significance is not knownyet. Contributing risk factors are:\n• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the\nheart and increases the risk of developing coronaryartery disease even if no other risk factors are present.Obesity increases blood pressure and blood cholesteroland can lead to diabetes.\n•Stress and anger—Some scientists believe that stress\nand anger can contribute to the development of coro-nary artery disease and increase the blood’s tendency toform clots (thrombosis). Stress, the mental and physicalreaction to life’s irritations and challenges, increasesthe heart rate and blood pressure and can injure the lin-ing of the arteries. Evidence shows that anger increasesthe risk of dying from heart disease. The risk of heartattack is more than double after an episode of anger.\nChest pain (angina) is the main symptom of coro-\nnary heart disease but it is not always present. Othersymptoms include shortness of breath , chest heaviness,\ntightness, pain, a burning sensation, squeezing, or pres-sure either behind the breastbone or in the arms, neck, orjaws. Many people have no symptoms of coronary arterydisease before having a heart attack; 63% of women and48% of men who died suddenly of coronary artery dis-ease had no previous symptoms of the disease, accordingto the American Heart Association.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis begins with a visit to the physician, who\nwill take a medical history, discuss symptoms, listen tothe heart, and perform basic screening tests. These testswill measure weight, blood pressure, blood lipid levels,and fasting blood glucose levels. Other diagnostic tests\ninclude resting and exercise electrocardiogram, echocar-\ndiography , radionuclide scans, and coronary angiogra-\nphy. The treadmill exercise (stress) test is an appropriate\nscreening test for those with high risk factors even whenthey feel well.An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s\nactivity and may reveal a lack of oxygen (ischemia).Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed onthe patient’s chest, arms, and legs. They send impulses ofthe heart’s activity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) toa recorder that traces them on paper. The test takes about10 minutes and is performed in a physician’s office. Adefinite diagnosis cannot be made from electrocardiog-\nraphy . About 50% of patients with significant coronary\nartery disease have normal resting electrocardiograms.Another type of electrocardiogram, known as the exer-cise stress test , measures how the heart and blood ves-\nsels respond to exertion when the patient is exercising ona treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed ina physician’s office or an exercise laboratory. It takes15–30 minutes. It is not perfectly accurate. It sometimesgives a normal reading when the patient has a heart prob-lem or an abnormal reading when the patient does not.\nIf the electrocardiogram reveals a problem or is\ninconclusive, the next step is exercise echocardiographyor nuclear scanning (angiography). Echocardiography,cardiac ultrasound, uses sound waves to create an imageof the heart’s chambers and valves. A technician appliesgel to a hand-held transducer, then presses it against thepatient’s chest. The heart’s sound waves are convertedinto an image that can be displayed on a monitor. It doesnot reveal the coronary arteries themselves, but candetect abnormalities in heart wall motion caused by coro-nary disease. Performed in a cardiology outpatient diag-nostic laboratory, the test takes 30–60 minutes.\nRadionuclide angiography enables physicians to see\nthe blood flow of the coronary arteries. Nuclear scans areperformed by injecting a small amount of radiopharma-ceutical such as thallium into the bloodstream. A devicethat uses gamma rays to produce an image of the radioac-tive material (gamma camera) records pictures of theheart. Radionuclide scans are not dangerous. The radia-tion exposure is about the same as that in a chest x ray .\nThe tiny amount of radioactive material used disappearsfrom the body in a few days. Radionuclide scans costabout four times as much as exercise stress tests but pro-vide more information.\nIn radionuclide angiography, a scanning camera\npasses back and forth over the patient who lies on a table.Radionuclide angiography is usually performed in a hos-pital’s nuclear medicine department and takes 30–60minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done in conjunc-tion with an exercise stress test. When the stress test isfinished, thallium or sestamibi is injected. The patientresumes exercise for one minute to absorb the thallium.For patients who cannot exercise, cardiac blood flow andheart rate may be increased by intravenous dipyridamole(Persantine) or adenosine. Thallium scanning is done\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 930Coronary artery diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 930twice, immediately after injecting the radiopharmaceuti-\ncal and again four hours (and maybe 24 hours) later. It isusually performed in a hospital’s nuclear medicinedepartment. Each scan takes 30–60 minutes.\nCoronary angiography is the most accurate method\nfor making a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but itis also the most invasive. It is a form of cardiac\ncatheterization that shows the heart’s chambers, great\nvessels, and coronary arteries using x-ray technology.During coronary angiography the patient is awake butsedated. ECG electrodes are placed on the patient’s chestand an intravenous line is inserted. A local anesthetic isinjected into the site where the catheter will be inserted.The cardiologist inserts a catheter into a blood vessel andguides it into the heart. A contrast dye is injected to makethe heart visible on x-ray cinematography. Coronaryangiography is performed in a cardiac catheterizationlaboratory either in an outpatient or inpatient surgeryunit. It takes from 30 minutes to two hours.\nTreatment\nCoronary artery disease can be treated many ways.\nThe choice of treatment depends on the severity of thedisease. Treatments include lifestyle changes and drugtherapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplas-\nty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Coronary artery\ndisease is a chronic disease requiring lifelong care.Angioplasty or bypass surgery is not a “cure.”\nPeople with less severe coronary artery disease may\ngain adequate control through lifestyle changes and drug\ntherapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent dis-ease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, weightloss if needed, exercise, and not smoking—also help pre-vent the disease from developing. These lifestyle changesare discussed in more detail under prevention.\nDrugs such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-\nchannel blockers relieve chest pain and complications ofcoronary artery disease, but they cannot clear blockedarteries. Nitrates (nitroglycerin) improve blood flow tothe heart. Beta-blockers (acebutelol, propranolol) reducethe amount of oxygen required by the heart during stress.One type of calcium-channel blocker (verapamil, dilti-azem hydrochloride) helps keep the arteries open andreduces blood pressure. Aspirin helps prevent blood\nclots from forming on plaques, reducing the likelihood ofa heart attack. Cholesterol-lowering medications are alsoindicated in most cases.\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\nbypass surgery are procedures that enter the body (inva-sive procedures) to improve blood flow in the coronaryarteries. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,KEY TERMS\nAtherosclerosis —A process in which the walls of\nthe coronary arteries thicken due to the accumula-tion of plaque in the blood vessels. Atherosclerosisis the cause of coronary artery disease.\nAngina —Chest pain that happens when diseased\nblood vessels restrict the flow of blood to theheart. Angina is often the first symptom of coro-nary artery disease.\nBeta-blocker —A drug that blocks some of the\neffects of fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline (epi-nephrine and norepinephrine), slowing the heartrate and lowering the blood pressure.\nCalcium-channel blocker —A drug that blocks the\nentry of calcium into the muscle cells of smallblood vessels (arterioles) and keeps them fromnarrowing.\nCoronary arteries —The main arteries that provide\nblood to the heart. The coronary arteries surroundthe heart like a crown, coming out of the aorta,arching down over the top of the heart, and divid-ing into two branches. These are the arteries inwhich coronary artery disease occurs.\nHDL cholesterol —High-density lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol is a component of cholesterol that helpsprotect against heart disease. HDL is nicknamed“good” cholesterol\nLDL Cholesterol —Low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol is the primary cholesterol molecule. Highlevels of LDL increase the risk of coronary heartdisease. LDL is nicknamed “bad” cholesterol.\nPlaque —A deposit of fatty and other substances\nthat accumulate in the lining of the artery wall.\nTriglyceride —A fat that comes from food or is\nmade from other energy sources in the body. Ele-vated triglyceride levels contribute to the develop-ment of atherosclerosis.\nusually called coronary angioplasty, is a non-surgical\nprocedure. A catheter tipped with a balloon is threadedfrom a blood vessel in the thigh into the blocked artery.The balloon is inflated, compressing the plaque toenlarge the blood vessel and open the blocked artery. Theballoon is deflated, and the catheter is removed. Coro-nary angioplasty is performed by a cardiologist in a hos-pital and generally requires a stay of one or two days.Coronary angioplasty is successful about 90% of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 931Coronary artery diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 931time, but for one-third of patients the artery narrows\nagain within six months. The procedure can be repeated.It is less invasive and less expensive than coronary arterybypass surgery.\nIn coronary artery bypass surgery, a healthy artery or\nvein from an arm, leg, or chest wall is used to build adetour around the coronary artery blockage. The healthyvessel then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart.Bypass surgery is major surgery. It is appropriate forthose patients with blockages in two or three major coro-nary arteries, those with severely narrowed left maincoronary arteries, and those who have not responded toother treatments. It is performed in a hospital under gen-eral anesthesia. A heart-lung machine is used to supportthe patient while the healthy vein or artery is attachedpast the blockage to the coronary artery. About 70% ofpatients who have bypass surgery experience full relieffrom angina; about 20% experience partial relief. Onlyabout 3–4% of patients per year experience a return ofsymptoms. Survival rates after bypass surgery decreaseover time. At five years after surgery, survival expectancyis 90%; at 10 years about 80%, at 15 years about 55%,and at 20 years about 40%.\nThree semi-experimental surgical procedures for\nunblocking coronary arteries are currently being studied.Atherectomy is a procedure in which the cardiologist\nshaves off and removes strips of plaque from the blockedartery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip isinserted into the affected artery to burn or break down theplaque. A metal coil called a stent can be implanted per-manently to keep a blocked artery open. Stenting isbecoming more common.\nAlternative treatment\nNatural therapies may reduce the risk of certain\ntypes of heart disease, but once symptoms appear, con-ventional medical attention is necessary. A healthy diet(including cold-water fish as a source of essential fattyacids) and exercise, important components of conven-tional prevention and treatment strategies, also areemphasized in alternative approaches to coronary arterydisease. Herbal medicine has a variety of remedies thatmay have a beneficial effect on coronary artery disease.For example, ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) may help\nreduce cholesterol. Garlic ( Allium sativum ), ginger, and\nhot red or chili peppers are all circulatory enhancers thatcan help prevent blood clots. Yoga and other bodywork,\nmassage, relaxation therapies, and talking therapies mayalso help prevent coronary artery disease and stop, oreven reverse, the progression of atherosclerosis. Vitaminand mineral therapy to reduce, reverse, or protect againstcoronary artery disease includes chromium; calcium andmagnesium; B-complex vitamins ; the anti-oxidant vita-\nmins C and E; selenium; and zinc. Traditional Chinese\nmedicine may recommend herbal remedies, massage,\nacupuncture , and dietary modification.\nPrognosis\nIn many cases, coronary artery disease can be suc-\ncessfully treated. Advances in medicine and healthierlifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death ratesfrom coronary artery disease since the mid-1980s. Newdiagnostic techniques enable doctors to identify and treatcoronary artery disease in its earliest stages. New tech-nologies and surgical procedures have extended the livesof many patients who would otherwise have died.Research on coronary artery disease continues.\nPrevention\nA healthy lifestyle can help prevent coronary artery\ndisease and help keep it from progressing. A heart-healthy lifestyle includes eating right, regular exercise,maintaining a healthy weight, no smoking, moderatedrinking, no recreational drugs, controlling hypertension,and managing stress. Cardiac rehabilitation programs\nare excellent to help prevent recurring coronary problemsfor people who are at risk and who have had coronaryevents and procedures.\nEat right\nA healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are\nlow in fat, especially saturated fat, low in cholesterol,and high in fiber. It includes plenty of fruits and vegeta-bles and limited sodium. Some foods are low in fat buthigh in cholesterol and some are low in cholesterol buthigh in fat. Saturated fat raises cholesterol and, in exces-sive amounts, increases the amount of the clot-formingproteins in blood. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturatedfats are good for the heart. Fat should comprise no morethan 30% of total daily calories.\nCholesterol, a waxy substance containing fats, is\nfound in foods such as meat, eggs, and other animalproducts. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble fibercan help lower cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol should belimited to about 300 milligrams per day. Many popularlipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL cholesterol by anaverage of 25–30% when used with a low-fat, low-cho-lesterol diet.\nFruits and vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and\nminerals . They are low-calorie and nearly fat free. Vita-\nmin C and beta-carotene, found in many fruits and veg-etables, keep LDL-cholesterol from turning into a formthat damages coronary arteries.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 932Coronary artery diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 932Excess sodium can increase the risk of high blood\npressure. Many processed foods contain large amounts ofsodium. Limit daily intake to about 2,400 milligrams,about the amount in a teaspoon of salt.\nThe “Food Guide” Pyramid developed by the U.S.\nDepartments of Agriculture and Health and Human Ser-vices provides easy-to-follow guidelines for daily heart-healthy eating. It recommends six to 11 servings of bread,cereal, rice, and pasta; three to five servings of vegetables;two to four servings of fruit; two to three servings of milk,yogurt, and cheese; and two to three servings of meat,poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. Fats, oils, andsweets should be used sparingly. Canola and olive oil arebetter for the heart than other cooking oils. Coronarypatients should be on a strict diet.\nExercise regularly\nAerobic exercise can lower blood pressure, help con-\ntrol weight, and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol. It maykeep the blood vessels more flexible. The Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention and the American College ofSports Medicine recommend moderate to intense aerobicexercise lasting about 30 minutes four or more times perweek for maximum heart health. Three 10-minute exerciseperiods are also beneficial. Aerobic exercise—activitiessuch as walking, jogging, and cycling—uses the large mus-cle groups and forces the body to use oxygen more effi-ciently. It can also include everyday activities such as activegardening, climbing stairs, or brisk housework. People withcoronary artery disease or risk factors should consult a doc-tor before beginning an exercise program.\nMaintain a desirable body weight\nAbout one quarter of all Americans are overweight\nand nearly one-tenth are obese, according to the SurgeonGeneral’s Report on Nutrition and Health. People who\nare 20% or more over their ideal body weight have anincreased risk of developing coronary artery disease.Losing weight can help reduce total and LDL choles-terol, reduce triglycerides, and boost HDL cholesterol. Itmay also reduce blood pressure. Eating right and exercis-ing are two key components of losing weight.\nAvoid recreational drugs\nDo not smoke or use tobacco. Smoking has many\nadverse effects on the heart. It increases the heart rate,constricts major arteries, and can create irregular heart-beats. It raises blood pressure, contributes to the develop-ment of plaque, increases the formation of blood clots,and causes blood platelets to cluster and impede bloodflow. Heart damage caused by smoking can be repairedby quitting. Even heavy smokers can return to hearthealth. Several studies have shown that ex-smokers face\nthe same risk of heart disease as non-smokers within fiveto 10 years after they quit.\nDrink in moderation. Modest consumption of alco-\nhol may actually protect against coronary artery diseasebecause alcohol appears to raise levels of HDL (“good”)cholesterol. The American Heart Association definesmoderate consumption as one ounce of alcohol per day,roughly one cocktail, one 8-ounce glass of wine, or two12-ounce glasses of beer. However, even moderate drink-ing can increase risk factors for heart disease for somepeople (by raising blood pressure, for example). Exces-sive drinking is always bad for the heart. It usually raisesblood pressure and can poison the heart and cause abnor-mal heart rhythms or even heart failure.\nDo not use other recreational drugs. Commonly used\nrecreational drugs, particularly cocaine and “crack,” can\nseriously harm the heart and should never be used.\nSeek treatment for hypertension\nHigh blood pressure, one of the most common and\nserious risk factors for coronary artery disease, can becompletely controlled through lifestyle changes andmedication. Moderate hypertension can be controlled byreducing dietary intake of sodium and fat, exercising reg-ularly, managing stress, abstaining from smoking, anddrinking alcohol in moderation. People for whom thesechanges do not work or people with severe hypertensionmay be helped by many categories of medication.\nManage stress\nEveryone experiences stress, the mental and physi-\ncal reaction to life’s irritations and challenges. Stress cansometimes be avoided and when it is inevitable, it can becontrolled. Techniques for controlling stress include: tak-ing life more slowly, spending more time with family andfriends, thinking positively, getting enough sleep, exer-cising, and practicing relaxation techniques.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Heart Association and American Cancer Society.\nLiving Well, Staying Well.

    "title": "Coronary stenting",
    "content": "Coronary stenting\nDefinition\nA coronary stent is an artificial support device used\nin the coronary artery to keep the vessel open.\nPurpose\nThe coronary stent is a relatively new tool used to\nkeep coronary arteries expanded, usually following a bal-loon angioplasty . Balloon angioplasty is used in patientswith coronary artery disease . In this disease, the blood\nvessels on the heart become narrow. When this happens,the oxygen supply is reduced to the heart muscle. Theprimary cause of coronary artery disease is fat depositsblocking the arteries ( atherosclerosis ). In many cases,\nballoon angioplasty is unsuccessful and the vessel closesafter the procedure (restenosis). By forming a rigid sup-port, the stent can prevent restenosis and reduce the needfor coronary bypass surgery. The stent is usually a stain-less steel mesh tube. Since the stent will be placed insidean artery, the device comes in various sizes to match thesize of the artery.\nPrecautions\nAny foreign object in the body, like a stent, will\nincrease the risk of thrombosis. Anticlotting medicationis given to prevent this complication.\nDescription\nCoronary stenting usually follows balloon angio-\nplasty, which requires inserting a balloon catheter intothe femoral artery in the upper thigh. When this catheteris positioned at the location of the blockage in the coro-nary artery, it is slowly inflated to widen that artery, andis then removed. The stent catheter is then threaded intothe artery and the stent is placed around a deflated bal-loon. When this is correctly positioned in the coronaryartery, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent againstthe walls of the coronary artery. The balloon catheter isremoved, leaving the stent in place to hold the coronaryartery open. A cardiac angiography will follow to insure\nthat the stent is keeping the artery open.\nAlternative procedures\nBalloon angioplasty and coronary stenting are per-\nformed to relieve the symptoms of coronary artery disease.By the time coronary artery disease progresses andrequires balloon angioplasty, there is no alternative to bal-loon angioplasty other than coronary bypass surgery.Coronary bypass surgery carries greater risks. However,since coronary artery disease can be related to high fatdiets ,smoking , and lack of exercise , changes in lifestyle\nmay reduce the risk of developing the disease. Variousmedications for cholesterol, high blood pressure, and dia-betes also can help treat or prevent coronary artery disease.\nPreparation\nBefore the stent is inserted, the patient will probably\nbe instructed to take aspirin for several days. Aspirin can\nhelp decrease the possibility of blood clots forming at the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 934Coronary stentingGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 934stent. Because anesthesia will be used during the proce-\ndure, the patient should not eat or drink after midnight ofthe previous day.\nAftercare\nFollowing the procedure, blood thinners (anticoagu-\nlants) will be given through a needle in a vein for about24 hours. The patient should remain flat and still forawhile to allow the femoral artery to heal from the inser-tion of the catheter. Medication to control blood clottingshould be taken after the patient is discharged from thehospital. A special diet may also be recommended that islow in vitamin K and cholesterol. With time, the patientshould begin light exercise, like walking. It is importantthat no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests are\ngiven for six months because the magnetic field maymove the stent.\nRisks\nAlthough coronary stents greatly reduce the risk of\nrestenosis following balloon angioplasty, there is stillsome risk that the stented artery may close. Thrombosis,bleeding, and artery damage are also risks.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGarratt, Kirk N., Guy S. Reeder, and David R.

    "title": "Corticosteroids",
    "content": "Corticosteroids\nDefinition\nCorticosteriods are a group of natural and synthetic\nanalogues of the hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, more com-monly referred to as the pituitary gland. These includeglucocorticoids, which are anti-inflammatory agents witha large number of other functions; mineralocorticoids,which control salt and water balance primarily throughaction on the kidneys; and corticotropins, which controlsecretion of hormones by the pituitary gland.\nPurpose\nGlucocorticoids have multiple effects, and are used\nfor a large number of conditions. They affect glucose uti-lization, fat metabolism, and bone development, and arepotent anti-inflammatory agents. They may be used forreplacement of natural hormones in patients with pitu-itary deficiency ( Addison’s disease ), as well as for a\nwide number of other conditions including, but not limit-ed to, arthritis, asthma , anemia, various cancers, and\nskin inflammations. Additional uses include inhibition ofnausea and vomiting after chemotherapy , treatment of\nseptic shock , treatment of spinal cord injuries, and treat-\nment of hirisutism (excessive hair growth). The choice ofdrug will vary with the condition. Cortisone and hydro-cortisone, which have both glucocorticoid and mineralo-corticoid effects, are the drugs of choice for replacementtherapy of natural hormone deficiency. Synthetic com-pounds, which have greater anti-inflammatory effectsand less effect on salt and water balance, are usually pre-ferred for other purposes. These compounds include dex-amethasone, which is almost exclusively glucocorticoidin its actions, as well as prednisone, prednisolone,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 935CorticosteroidsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 935betamethasone, trimacinolone, and others. Glucocorti-\ncoids are formulated in oral dosage forms, topical creamsand ointments, oral and nasal inhalations, rectal foams,and ear and eye drops.\nMineralocorticoids control the retention of sodium\nin the kidneys. In mineralocorticoid deficiency, there isexcessive loss of sodium through the kidneys, withresulting water loss. Fludrocortisone (Florinef) is theonly drug available for treatment of mineralocorticoiddeficiency, and is available only in an oral dosage form.\nCorticotropin (ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone)\nstimulates the pituitary gland to release cortisone. A defi-ciency of corticotropic hormone will have the same effectsas a deficiency of cortisone. The hormone, which is avail-able under the brand names Acthar and Actrel, is used fordiagnostic testing, to determine the cause of a glucocorti-coid deficiency, but is rarely used for replacement therapysince direct administration of glucocorticoids may be easi-er and offers better control over dosages.KEY TERMS\nHallucination —A false or distorted perception of\nobjects, sounds, or events that seems real. Halluci-nations usually result from drugs or mental disor-ders.\nHormone —A substance that is produced in one\npart of the body, then travels through the blood-stream to another part of the body where it has itseffect.\nInflammation —Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\nthat usually develop in response to injury or ill-ness.\nOintment —A thick, spreadable substance that\ncontains medicine and is meant to be used on theoutside of the body.\nPregnancy category —A system of classifying\ndrugs according to their established risks for useduring pregnancy. Category A: controlled humanstudies have demonstrated no fetal risk. CategoryB: animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but nohuman studies; or adverse effects in animals, butnot in well-controlled human studies. Category C:no adequate human or animal studies; or adversefetal effects in animal studies, but no availablehuman data. Category D: evidence of fetal risk,but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: evidenceof fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.Recommended dosage\nThe dosage of glucocorticoids varies with the drug,\nroute of administration, condition being treated, andpatient. Consult specific references.\nFludrocortisone, for use in replacement therapy, is\nnormally dosed at 0.1 mg/day. Some patients requirehigher doses. It should normally be administered in con-junction with cortisone or hydrocortisone.\nACTH, when used for diagnostic purposes, is given\nas 10–25 units dissolved in 500 ml of 5% dextrose injec-tion-infused IV over eight hours. A long-acting form,which may be used for replacement therapy, is given bysubcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection at adose of 40 to 80 units every 24–72 hours.\nPrecautions\nGlucocorticoids\nThe most significant risk associated with administra-\ntion of glucocorticoids is suppression of natural corticos-teroid secretion. When the hormones are administered,they suppress the secretion of ACTH, which in turnreduces the secretion of the natural hormones. The extentof suppression varies with dose, drug potency, duration oftreatment, and individual patient response. While suppres-sion is seen primarily with drugs administered systemical-ly, it can also occur with topical drugs such as creams andointments, or drugs administered by inhalation. Abruptcessation of corticosteroids may result in acute adrenal cri-sis (Addisonian crisis) that is marked by dehydration\nwith severe vomiting and diarrhea ,hypotension , and loss\nof consciousness. Acute adrenal crisis is potentially fatal.\nChronic overdose of glucocorticoids leads to Cushin-\ngoid syndrome, which is clinically identical to Cushing’s\nsyndrome and differs only in that in Cushingoid, the\nexcessive steroids are from drug therapy rather thanexcessive glandular secretion. Symptoms vary, but mostpeople have upper body obesity , rounded face, increased\nfat around the neck, and thinning arms and legs. In itslater stages, this condition leads to weakening of bonesand muscles with rib and spinal column fractures .\nThe short term adverse effects of corticosteroids are\ngenerally mild, and include indigestion , increased\nappetite, insomnia , and nervousness. There are also a\nvery large number of infrequent adverse reactions, themost significant of which is drug induced-paranoia.Delerium, depression, menstrual irregularity, andincreased hair growth are also possible. Consult detailedreviews for further information.\nLong-term use of topical glucocorticoids can result\nin thinning of the skin. Oral steroid inhalations may cause\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 936CorticosteroidsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 936fungal overgrowth in the oral cavity. Patients must be\ninstructed to rinse their mouths carefully after each dose.Corticosteroids are pregnancy category C. The drugs\nhave caused congenital malformations in animal studies,including cleft palate. Breastfeeding should be avoided.\nMineralocorticoids\nBecause fludrocortisone has glucocorticoid activity\nas well as mineralocorticoid action, the same hazards andprecautions apply to fludrocortisone as to the glucocorti-coids. Overdose of fludrocortisone may also causeedema ,hypertension, and congestive heart failure .\nCorticotropins\nCorticotropin has all the same risks as the glucocor-\nticoids. Prolonged use may cause reduced response to thestimulatory effects of corticotropin.\nWarnings and contraindications\nUse corticosteroids with caution in patients with the\nfollowing conditions:\n• osteoporosis or any other bone disease\n• current or past tuberculosis• glaucoma or cataracts• infections of any type (virus, bacteria, fungus, amoeba)• sores in the nose or recent nose surgery (if using nasal\nspray forms of corticosteroids)\n• underactive or overactive thyroid• liver disease• stomach or intestine problems• diabetes• heart disease\n• high blood pressure\n• high cholesterol• kidney disease or kidney stones• myasthenia gravis• systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)• emotional problems• skin conditions that cause the skin to be thinner to\nbruise more easily\nInteractions\nCorticosteroids have many drug interactions.

    "title": "Cortisol tests",
    "content": "Cortisol tests\nDefinition\nThis test is a measure of serum cortisol (also known\nas hydrocortisone), or urine cortisol (also known as uri-nary free cortisol), an important hormone produced by apair of endocrine glands called the adrenal glands.\nPurpose\nThis test is performed on patients who may have\nmalfunctioning adrenal glands. Blood and urine cortisol,together with the determination of adrenocorticotropichormone (ACTH), are the three most important tests inthe investigation of Cushing’s syndrome (caused by an\noverproduction of cortisol) and Addison’s disease\n(caused by the underproduction of cortisol).\nPrecautions\nIncreased levels of cortisol are associated with preg-\nnancy . Physical and emotional stress can also elevate\ncortisol levels. Drugs that may cause increased levels ofcortisol include estrogen, oral contraceptives , ampheta-\nmines, cortisone, and spironolactone (Aldactone). Drugsthat may cause decreased levels include androgens,aminoglutethimide, betamethasone, and other steroidmedications, danazol, lithium, levodopa, metyrapone andphenytoin (Dilantin).\nDescription\nCortisol is a potent hormone known as a glucocorti-\ncoid that affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, pro-teins, and fats, but especially glucose. Cortisol increasesblood sugar levels by stimulating the release of glucosefrom glucose stores in cells. It also acts to inhibit insulin,thus affecting glucose transport into cells.\nThe hypothalamus (an area of the brain), the pitu-\nitary gland (sometimes called the “master gland”), and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 937Cortisol testsGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 937the adrenal glands coordinate the production of cortisol.\nAfter corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is made inthe hypothalamus, CRH stimulates the pituitary to pro-duce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The produc-tion of ACTH in turn stimulates a part of the adrenalglands known as the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol.Rising levels of cortisol act as a negative feedback to cur-tail further production of CRH and ACTH, thus complet-ing an elaborate feedback mechanism.\nThere are two methods for evaluating cortisol: blood\nand urine. The most reliable index of cortisol secretion isthe 24-hour urine sample collection, but when blood lev-els are required or requested by the physician, plasmacortisol should be measured in the morning and again inthe afternoon. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall dur-ing the day in what is called a diurnal variation, so thatcortisol is at its highest level between 6–8 \nA.M. and grad-\nually falls, reaching its lowest point around midnight.One reason for ordering blood cortisol levels versus a 24-hour urine collection is that sometimes the earliest signof adrenal malfunction is the loss of this diurnal varia-tion, even though the cortisol levels are not yet elevated.For example, individuals with Cushing’s syndrome oftenhave upper normal plasma cortisol levels in the morningand exhibit no decline as the day progresses.KEY TERMS\nAddison’s disease —A rare disorder in which symp-\ntoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocortisone(cortisol) and aldosterone, two corticosteroid hor-mones normally produced by a part of the adrenalglands called the adrenal cortex.

It entails the use of a bleaching solutionapplied by a dentist or a gel in a tray that fits over theteeth used at home under a dentist’s supervision. Bond-ing involves applying tooth-colored plastic putty, calledcomposite resin, to the surface of chipped or brokenteeth. This resin is also used to fill cavities in front teeth(giving a more natural-looking result) and to fill gapsbetween teeth. Veneers are thin, porcelain shells thatcover the front of the teeth. They can improve theappearance of damaged, discolored, misshapen, or mis-aligned teeth. Reshaping involves the removal of enam-el from a misshapen tooth so that it matches other teeth.Orthodontics uses braces to correct the position ofcrowded or misaligned teeth. Implants are artificialteeth which are attached directly to the jaw to replacemissing teeth.\nPreparation\nBleaching involves having a custom-made bleaching\ntray made by the dentist. This tray is worn at home forseveral hours each day or night. Teeth slowly becomewhite over a period of one to six weeks. Bleaching canalso be done in a dentist’s office. A heat- or light-activatedbleaching solution is applied to six to eight teeth per visit.\nBonding involves etching the surface of the tooth so\ncomposite resin can adhere. The dentist then contours theresin to the right shape, and smooths and polishes theresin after it is hard and dry.\nTo prepare for the application of a veneer, a thin layer\nof enamel is removed from the tooth (so that the finishedtooth will be flush with surrounding teeth) and an impres-sion of the tooth is taken from which the veneer will becreated. Before a veneer is applied, the tooth is etchedwith an acid solution and an adhesive resin is painted onthe tooth. The veneer is then applied, the resin is hardenedwith a bonding light, and the dentist polishes the veneer.KEY TERMS\nBleaching —Technique used to brighten stained\nteeth.\nBonding —Rebuilding, reshaping, and covering\ntooth defects using tooth-colored materials.\nComposite resin —Plastic material matching natur-\nal tooth color used to replace missing parts of atooth.\nDuring cosmetic reshaping, some enamel is\nremoved from the uneven tooth so it more closely match-es other teeth.\nOrthodontics involves applying braces to the teeth,\nand wires are threaded through the braces. These wiresare adjusted to gradually move the teeth to the desirednew positions. Over time, crowded or misaligned teethare straightened.\nImplants are more secure and natural looking than\ndentures or bridgework, but are much more expensive.First an anchor for the implant is attached to the jawbone. This surgery can take several hours. About sixmonths later, after the bone around the anchor hashealed, a post is attached to the anchor, and an artificialtooth is attached to the post. The whole process may takeabout nine months to complete.\nAftercare\nPeriodic touch-up may be needed to keep the teeth\nwhite if the teeth have been bleached or bonded. Also, theresin used in bonded teeth can be chipped by ice, popcornkernels, or hard candy, requiring repair. Veneered teethmay need to be reveneered after five to 12 years. Onceorthodontic braces are removed, regular visits to theorthodontist are advised because teeth can shift position.Implanted teeth require regular dental checkups to ensurethat the anchor and post are stable.\nRisks\nAfter teeth are bleached, they may darken faster if\nexposed to staining products such as coffee or tobacco.Some patients experience increased sensitivity to coldwhile teeth are being bleached, but the sensitivity usuallydisappears shortly after completion of the treatment.\nBonded teeth, like bleached teeth, may also stain\nmore easily than natural teeth.

    "title": "Costochondritis",
    "content": "Costochondritis\nDefinition\nCostochondritis is an inflammation and associated\ntenderness of the cartilage (i.e., the costochondral joints)that attaches the front of the ribs to the breastbone.\nDescription\nCostochondritis causes pain in the lower rib area or\nupper breastbone. Some patients fear they are having aheart attack . The most severe pain is usually between the\nbreast and the upper abdomen. The pain may be greaterwhen in sitting or reclining positions. Stress may aggra-\nvate this condition. Generally the third or fourth ribs areaffected. However, any of the seven costochondral junc-tions may be affected, and more often than not more thanone site is involved. The inflammation can involve carti-lage areas on both sides of the sternum, but usually is onone side only. Costochondritis should be distinguishedfrom Tietze Syndrome, which is an inflammation involv-ing the same area of the chest, but also includes swelling.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of costochondritis are not well-under-\nstood and may be difficult to establish. The most likelycauses include injury, repetitive minor trauma, andunusual excessive physical activity.The primary symptom of costochondritis is severe\nchest wall pain, which may vary in intensity. The painbecomes worse with trunk movement, deep breathing,and/or exertion, and better with decreased movement, quietbreathing, or changing of position. It is usually localized butmay radiate extensively from the chest area. The pain hasbeen described as sharp, nagging, aching, or pressure-like.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on pain upon palpation (gentle\npressing) of the affected joints. Swelling is not associatedwith costochondritis. Diagnosis is also dependent on theexclusion of other causes, including heart attack or bac-terial or fungal infections found in IV drug users or post-operative thoracic surgery patients.\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are to reduce inflammation and\nto control pain. To accomplish these goals, nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are used, with ibupro-fen usually selected as the drug of choice. Other NSAIDSoptions are flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, andnaproxen. Additional treatment recommendations includethe use of local heat, biofeedback , and gentle stretching of\nthe pectoralis muscles two to three times a day.\nFor more difficult cases, where the patient continues\nto exhibit pain and discomfort, cortisone injections areused as therapy.\nAlternative treatment\nSupplements that are used to reduce inflammation\nhave been used to treat costochondritis. Examples ofsuch supplements include ginger root, evening primroseoil, bromelain, vitamin E, omega-3 oils, and white wil-low bark. Glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate, which mayaid in the healing of cartilage, has also been used. Otheralternative therapies include acupuncture and massages.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from costochondritis is\ngood. For most patients, the condition lessens in six\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 940CostochondritisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 940months to a year. However, after one year, about one-half\nof patients continue with some discomfort, while aboutone-third still report tenderness with palpation.\nPrevention\nThough the causes of costochondritis are not well\nknown, avoidance of activities that may strain (e.g., therepetitive misuse of muscles) or cause trauma to the ribcage is recommended to prevent the occurrence of costo-chondritis. Modification of improper posture orergonomics of the home or work place may also deter thedevelopment of this condition.\nResources\nOTHER\nDay, C.

    "title": "Cough",
    "content": "Cough\nDefinition\nA cough is a forceful release of air from the lungs\nthat can be heard. Coughing protects the respiratory sys-tem by clearing it of irritants and secretions.\nDescription\nWhile people can generally cough voluntarily, a\ncough is usually a reflex triggered when an irritant stim-ulates one or more of the cough receptors found at dif-ferent points in the respiratory system. These receptorsthen send a message to the cough center in the brain,which in turn tells the body to cough. A cough beginswith a deep breath in, at which point the openingbetween the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx(glottis) shuts, trapping the air in the lungs. As thediaphragm and other muscles involved in breathingpress against the lungs, the glottis suddenly opens, pro-ducing an explosive outflow of air at speeds greater than100 mi (160 km) per hour.In normal situations, most people cough once or\ntwice an hour during the day to clear the airway of irri-tants. However, when the level of irritants in the air ishigh or when the respiratory system becomes infected,coughing may become frequent and prolonged. It mayinterfere with exercise or sleep, and it may also cause dis-\ntress if accompanied by dizziness , chest pain , or breath-\nlessness. In the majority cases, frequent coughing lastsone to two weeks and tapers off as the irritant or infectionsubsides. If a cough lasts more than three weeks it is con-sidered a chronic cough, and physicians will try to deter-mine a cause beyond an acute infection or irritant.\nCoughs are generally described as either dry or pro-\nductive. A dry cough does not bring up a mixture ofmucus, irritants, and other substances from the lungs(sputum), while a productive cough does. In the case of abacterial infection, the sputum brought up in a productivecough may be greenish, gray, or brown. In the case of anallergy or viral infection it may be clear or white. In themost serious conditions, the sputum may contain blood.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn the majority of cases, coughs are caused by respi-\nratory infections, including:\n• colds or influenza , the most common causes of coughs\n•bronchitis , an inflammation of the mucous membranes\nof the bronchial tubes\n• croup, a viral inflammation of the larynx, windpipe,\nand bronchial passages that produces a bark-like coughin children\n• whooping cough, a bacterial infection accompanied by\nthe high-pitched cough for which it is named\n•pneumonia , a potentially serious bacterial infection\nthat produces discolored or bloody mucus\n•tuberculosis , another serious bacterial infection that\nproduces bloody sputum\n• fungal infections, such as aspergillosis ,histoplasmo-\nsis, and cryptococcoses\nEnvironmental pollutants, such as cigarette smoke,\ndust, or smog, can also cause a cough. In the case of cig-arette smokers, the nicotine present in the smoke para-lyzes the hairs (cilia) that regularly flush mucus from therespiratory system. The mucus then builds up, forcingthe body to removed it by coughing. Post-nasal drip, theirritating trickle of mucus from the nasal passages intothe throat caused by allergies or sinusitis , can also result\nin a cough. Some chronic conditions, such as asthma ,\nchronic bronchitis, emphysema , and cystic fibrosis , are\ncharacterized in part by a cough. A condition in whichstomach acid backs up into the esophagus (gastroe-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 941CoughGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 941sophageal reflux) can cause coughing, especially when a\nperson is lying down. A cough can also be a side-effectof medications that are administered via an inhaler. It canalso be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors,which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure.\nDiagnosis\nTo determine the cause of a cough, a physician\nshould take an exact medical history and perform anexam. Information regarding the duration of the cough,what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi-ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his orher diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will alsohelp determine what type of infection, if any, may beinvolved. The doctor may even observe the sputummicroscopically for the presence of bacteria and whiteblood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presenceand extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo-sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the causeof the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be\nordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments toinspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx.\nTreatment\nTreatment of a cough generally involves addressing\nthe condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu-monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced\ncough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators,or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of anallergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productivecough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys-tem of infective agents and irritants. However, coughKEY TERMS\nAntitussives —Drugs used to suppress coughing.\nExpectorant —Drug used to thin mucus.\nGastroesophageal reflux —Condition in which\nstomach acid backs up into the esophagus.\nGlottis —The opening between the vocal cords at\nthe upper part of the larynx.\nLarynx— A part of the respiratory tract between the\npharynx and the trachea, having walls of cartilageand muscle and containing the vocal cords.\nSputum —The mixture of mucus, irritants, and\nother substances expelled from the lungs bycoughing.medicines may be given if the patient cannot rest because\nof the cough or if the cough is not productive, as is thecase with most coughs associated with colds or flu. Thetwo types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussivesand expectorants .\nAntitussives\nAntitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar-\ncotics—primarily codeine—are used as antitussives andwork by depressing the cough center in the brain. How-ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau-sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary\ningredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies,also depresses the brain’s cough center, but without theside effects associated with narcotics. Demulcentsrelieve coughing by coating irritated passageways.\nExpectorants\nExpectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to\ncough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrateare the primary ingredients in most over-the-counterexpectorants. However, some studies have shown that inacute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has thesame thinning effect as taking expectorants.\nAlternative treatment\nCoughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory\ninfections may be effectively treated with botanical andhomeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will varyand be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Somecombination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathiccough formulas can be very effective for cough relief.Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treatedby a trained practitioner.\nMany health practitioners advise increasing fluids\nand breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen-ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavoredwith honey as a temporary home remedy for coughscaused by colds or flu. Various vitamins , such as vitamin\nC, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions(including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding ofmucous-producing foods can be effective in healing acough condition. These mucous-producing foods canvary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy productsare a major mucous-producing food for most people.\nPrognosis\nBecause the majority of coughs are related to the\ncommon cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21\ndays. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under-lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 942CoughGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 942Prevention\nIt is important to identify and treat the underlying\ndisease and origin of the cough.

    "content": "Craniosacral therapy\nDefinition\nCraniosacral therapy is a holistic healing practice\nthat uses very light touching to balance the craniosacralsystem in the body, which includes the bones, nerves, flu-ids, and connective tissues of the cranium and spinal area.\nPurpose\nAccording to Upledger, craniosacral therapy is ide-\nally suited for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD), headaches, chronic middle ear infection, pain ,\nand general health maintenance. It is recommended forautism ,fibromyalgia , heart disease, osteoarthritis ,\npneumonia ,rheumatoid arthritis , chronic sinus infec-\ntions, and gastroenteritis (inflammation of the lining of\nthe stomach or small intestine). It is also used with othertherapies to treat chronic fatigue syndrome , back pain,\nand menstrual irregularity. In addition, other craniosacralpractitioners have reported benefits for eye dysfunction,dyslexia , depression, motor coordination difficulties,\ntemporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), hyperac-tivity, colic ,asthma in babies, floppy baby syndrome,\nwhiplash ,cerebral palsy , certain birth defects , and\nother central nervous system disorders.\nDescription\nOrigins\nThe first written reference to the movement of the\nspinal nerves and its importance in life, clarity, and“bringing quiet to the heart” is found in a 4,000-year-oldtext from China. Craniosacral work was referred to as“the art of listening.” Bone setters in the Middle Agesalso sensed the subtle movements of the body. They usedthese movements to help reset fractures and dislocations\nand to treat headaches.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 944Craniosacral therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 944In the early 1900s, the research of Dr. William\nSutherland, an American osteopathic physician, detailedthe movement of the cranium and pelvis. Before hisresearch it was believed that the cranium was a solidimmovable mass. Sutherland reported that the skull isactually made up of 22 separate and movable bones thatare connected by layers of tissue. He called his work cra-nial osteopathy . Nephi Cotton, an American chiroprac-\ntor and contemporary of Sutherland, called this approachcraniology. The graduates of these two disciplines haverefined and enhanced these original approaches andrenamed their work as sacro-occipital technique, cranialmovement therapy , or craniosacral therapy.\nDr. John Upledger, an osteopathic physician, and\nothers at the Department of Biomechanics at MichiganState University, College of Osteopathic Medicinelearned of Sutherland’s research and developed it further.He researched the clinical observations of various osteo-pathic physicians. This research provided the basis forUpledger’s work that he named craniosacral therapy.\nCraniosacral therapy addresses the craniosacral sys-\ntem. This system includes the cranium, spine, andsacrum that are connected by a continuous membrane ofconnective tissue deep inside the body, called the duramater. The dura mater also encloses the brain and thecentral nervous system. Sutherland noticed that cerebralspinal fluid rises and falls within the compartment of thedura mata. He called this movement the primary respira-tory impulse; today it is known as the craniosacralrhythm (CSR) or the cranial wave.\nCraniosacral therapists can most easily feel the CSR\nin the body by lightly touching the base of the skull orthe sacrum. During a session, they feel for disturbancesin the rate, amplitude, symmetry, and quality of flow ofthe CSR. A therapist uses very gentle touch to balancethe flow of the CSR. Once the cerebrospinal fluid movesfreely, the body’s natural healing responses can function.\nA craniosacral session generally lasts 30–90 min-\nutes. The client remains fully clothed and lays down on amassage table while the therapist gently assesses theflow of the CSR. Upledger describes several techniqueswhich may be used in a craniosacral therapy session. Thefirst is energy cyst release. “This technique is a hands-onmethod of releasing foreign or disruptive energies fromthe patient’s body. Energy cysts may cause the disruptionof the tissues and organs were they are located.” Thetherapist feels these cysts in the client’s body and gentlyreleases the blockage of energy.\nSutherland first wrote about a second practice called\ndirection of energy. In this technique the therapist intendsenergy to pass from one of his hands, through the patient,into the other hand.WILLIAM SUTHERLAND\n(1873–1954)\nWilliam Garner Sutherland studied osteopathy\nunder its founder, Andrew Taylor Still. Dr. Sutherlandmade his own important discovery while examining thesutures of cranial bones the skull bones that protect thebrain. What he noticed is that the sutures were designedfor motion. Sutherland termed this motion the Breath of\nLife. Through his experiments and research he deter-\nmined that primary respiration was essential to all otherphysiological functions.\nWhen Sutherland developed his techniques for\ncraniosacral therapy, he wanted it to serve as a vehiclefor listening to the body’s rhythmic motions and treat thepatterns of inertia when those motions become congest-ed. He believed that the stresses—any physical or emo-tional trauma—created an imbalance in the body thatneeded correction to restore it to full health. The therapyis a hands-on method so that the therapist can feel thesubtleties of the patterns of movement and inertia.Sutherland felt that this was the way to encourage self-healing and restoration of the body’s own mechanisms,taking a holistic approach to creating optimal health.\nThe Craniosacral Therapy Educational Trust, based\non Sutherland’s pioneering work, is located at 10 Norm-ington Close, Leigham Court Road, London SW16 2QS,United Kingdom. The phone number is 07000 785778.\nThe third technique is called myofascial release.\nThis is a manipulative form of bodywork that releasestension in the fascia or connective tissue of the body.This form of bodywork uses stronger touch.\nUpledger’s fourth technique is position of release.\nThis involves following the client’s body into the posi-tions in which an injury occurred and holding it there.When the rhythm of the CSR suddenly stops the therapistknows that the trauma has been released.\nThe last technique is somatoemotional release. This\ntechnique was developed by Upledger and is an offshootof craniosacral therapy. It is used to release the mind andbody of the residual effects of trauma and injury that are“locked in the tissues.”\nThe cost of a session varies due to the length of time\nneeded and the qualifications of the therapist. The costmay be covered by insurance when the therapy is per-formed or prescribed by a licensed health care provider.\nPrecautions\nThis gentle approach is extremely safe in most cases.\nHowever, craniosacral therapy is not recommended in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 945Craniosacral therapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 945cases of acute systemic infections, recent skull fracture,\nintracranial hemorrhage or aneurysm, or herniation of themedulla oblongata (brain stem). Craniosacral therapydoes not preclude the use of other medical approaches.\nSide effects\nSome people may experience mild discomfort after a\ntreatment. This may be due to re-experiencing a trauma orinjury or a previously numb area may come back to lifeand be more sensitive. These side effects are temporary.\nResearch and general acceptance\nMore than 40 scientific papers have been published\nthat document the various effects of craniosacral therapy.There are also 10 authoritative textbooks on this therapy.The most notable scientific papers include Viola M. Fry-man’s work documenting the successful treatment of1,250 newborn children with birth defects. Edna Lay andStephen Blood showed the effects on TMD, and JohnWood documented results with psychiatric disorders.The American Dental Association has found craniosacraltherapy to be an effective adjunct to orthodontic work.However, the conventional medical community has notendorsed these techniques.\nResources\nBOOKS\nKnaster, Mirka.

It may also be done to\nremove a blood clot and control hemorrhage, inspect thebrain, perform a biopsy, or relieve pressure inside the skull.\nPrecautions\nBefore the operation, the patient will have undergone\ndiagnostic procedures such as computed tomography\nscans (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\nto determine the underlying problem that required thecraniotomy and to get a better look at the brain’s structure.Cerebral angiography may be used to study the blood\nsupply to the tumor, aneurysm, or other brain lesion.\nDescription\nThere are two basic ways to open the skull:\n• a curving incision from behind the hairline, in front of\nthe ear, arching above the eye\n• at the nape of the neck around the occipital lobe\nThe surgeon marks with a felt tip pen a large square\nflap on the scalp that covers the surgical area. Followingthis mark, the surgeon makes an incision into the skin asfar as the thin membrane covering the skull bone.Because the scalp is well supplied with blood, the sur-geon will have to seal many small arteries. The surgeonthen folds back a skin flap to expose the bone.\nUsing a high speed hand drill or an automatic cran-\niotome, the surgeon makes a circle of holes in the skull,and pushes a soft metal guide under the bone from onehole to the next. A fine wire saw is then moved along theguide channel under the bone between adjacent holes.The surgeon saws through the bone until the bone flapcan be removed to expose the brain.\nAfter the surgery for the underlying cause is com-\npleted, the piece of skull is replaced and secured withpieces of fine, soft wire. Finally, the surgeon sutures themembrane, muscle, and skin of the scalp.\nPreparation\nBefore the surgery, patients are usually given drugs\nto ease anxiety , and other medications to reduce the risk\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 946CraniotomyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 946of swelling, seizures, and infection after the operation.\nFluids may be restricted, and a diuretic may be givenbefore and during surgery if the patient has a tendency toretain water.

Codeine maybe given to relieve the headache that may occur as a\nresult of stretching or irritation of the nerves of the scalpthat happens during the craniotomy. Some type ofdrainage from the head may be in place, depending onthe reason for the surgery.\nPatients are usually out of bed within a day and out\nof the hospital within a week. Headache and pain from\nthe scalp wound can be controlled with medications.\nThe bandage on the skull should be changed regular-\nly. Sutures closing the scalp will be removed, but softwires used to reattach the skull are permanent and\nrequire no further attention. The patient should avoid get-ting the scalp wet until all the sutures have beenremoved. A clean cap or scarf can be worn until the hairgrows back.\nRisks\nAccessing the area of the brain that needs repair may\ndamage other brain tissue. Therefore, the procedure car-ries with it some risk of brain damage that could leavethe patient with some loss of brain function.

    "content": "Creatine kinase test\nDefinition\nThe creatine kinase test measures the blood levels of\ncertain muscle and brain enzyme proteins.\nPurpose\nCreatine kinase (CK or CPK) is an enzyme (a type\nof protein) found in muscle and brain. Normally, very lit-tle CK is found circulating in the blood. Elevated levelsindicate damage to either muscle or brain; possibly froma myocardial infarction ( heart attack ), muscle disease,\nor stroke .\nThere are three types, or isoforms, of CK:\n• CK-I, or BB, is produced primarily by brain and\nsmooth muscle.\n• CK-II, or MB, is produced primarily by heart muscle.• CK-III, or MM, is produced primarily by skeletal muscle.\nPrecautions\nNo special precautions are necessary, except in\npatients with a bleeding disorder.KEY TERMS\nCraniotome —A type of surgical drill used to oper-\nate on the skull. It has a self-controlled system thatstops the drill when the bone is penetrated.Description\nA small amount of blood is drawn and used for labo-\nratory analysis.\nPreparation\nPhysical activity may cause a rise in CK levels,\nespecially the CK-III fraction. Therefore, patients shouldnot engage in strenuous physical activity the day of thetest. The patient should report any recent injections, falls,or bruises that have occurred, as these may elevate CK\nlevels as well.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is required, except to keep the puncture\nsite clean while it heals.\nRisks\nThere are no risks to this test beyond the very slight\nrisk of infection at the puncture site.\nNormal results\nIn females, total CK should be 10–79 units per liter\n(U/L). In males, total CK should be 17–148 U/L. CK lev-els are reduced in the first half of pregnancy , and\nincreased in the second half. CK levels are elevated innewborns.\nThe distribution of isoenzymes should be:\n• CK-I: 0%• CK-II: 0–5%\n• CK-III: 95–100%\nAbnormal results\nElevation of CK-I may be seen in stroke, extreme\nshock , or brain tumor .\nElevation of CK-II is seen after a myocardial infarc-\ntion. It begins to rise three to six hours after the heartattack, and may peak within 24 hours. It should thenreturn to normal. For this reason, it is a useful marker forrecent myocardial infarction, but not for one whichoccurred more than a day before the test.\nElevation of CK-III indicates skeletal muscle dam-\nage. This may occur from normal exercise , trauma, or\nmuscle disease. CK levels may be very high early on inmuscular dystrophy , but may fall to normal later as\nmuscle tissue is lost. Elevated CK is also seen in myosi-tis, myoglobinuria, toxoplasmosis , and trichinosis .\nHypothyroidism may also cause elevated CK.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 948Creatine kinase testGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 948Resources\nBOOKS\nCorbett, Jane Vincent.

Creatine phos-phate is used in skeletal muscle contraction.\nPurpose\nThe creatinine test is used to diagnose impaired kid-\nney function and to determine renal (kidney) damage.\nPrecautions\nA diet high in meat content can cause transient ele-\nvations of serum creatinine. Some drugs that mayincrease creatinine values include gentamicin, cimeti-dine, heavy-metal chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cis-platin), and other drugs toxic to the kidneys, such as thecephalosporins .\nDescription\nThe creatinine test is used to measure the amount of\ncreatinine in the blood.

When thekidneys are functioning normally, the serum creatininelevel should remain constant and normal. Slight increas-es in creatine levels can appear after meals, especiallyafter ingestion of large quantities of meat, and some diur-nal variation may occur, with a low point at 7 \nA.M. and a\npeak at 7 P.M. Serious renal disorders, such as glomeru-\nlonephritis ,pyelonephritis , and urinary obstruction,\nwill cause abnormal elevations.\nThe creatinine level is interpreted in conjunction\nwith another kidney function test called the Blood UreaNitrogen (BUN). The serum creatinine level has muchthe same significance as the BUN but tends to rise later.Because of this, determinations of creatinine help tochronicle a disease process. Generally, a doubling of cre-atinine suggests a 50% reduction in kidney filtration rate.\nPreparation\nThe creatinine test requires a blood sample. It is rec-\nommended that the patient be fasting (nothing to eat or\ndrink) for at least eight hours before the test. The physi-cian may also require that ascorbic acid (vitamin C),barbiturates , and diuretics be withheld for 24 hours.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\nNormal results\nNormal values can vary from laboratory to laborato-\nry, but are generally in the following ranges:\n• Adult female: 0.5–1.1 mg/dL\n• Adult male: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL\n• Adolescent: 0.5–1.0 mg/dL\n• Child: 0.3–0.7 mg/dL\n• Infant: 0.2–0.4 mg/dL• Newborn: 0.3–1.2 mg/dL\nNote that variations between sources for serum crea-\ntinine normal ranges are greater than for other importanttests.

    "content": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\nDefinition\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a transmissible,\nrapidly progressing, fatal neurodegenerative disorderKEY TERMS\nGlomerulonephritis —Glomerulonephritis is an\ninflammation of the filtering units of the kidney(glomeruli). The condition hinders removal ofwaste products, salt, and water from the blood-stream, leading to serious complications. It is themost common cause of renal failure.\nPyelonephritis —Pyelonephritis is an inflammation\nof the kidney itself, usually caused by a bacterialinfection. In its most serious form, complicationscan include high blood pressure (hypertension)and renal failure.called a spongioform degeneration that seems to be relat-\ned to “mad cow disease.”\nDescription\nBefore 1995, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was little-\nknown outside of the medical profession; even within it,many practitioners did not know much about it. Mostdoctors had never seen a case. With the recognition of aso-called “new variant” or simply variant form of CJDwith the strong possibility that those with it becameinfected simply by eating contaminated beef, CJD hasbecome one of the most talked-about diseases in theworld. Additionally, the radical theory that the infectiousagent is a normal protein that has been changed in itsform has also sparked much interest.\nFirst described in the first part of the twentieth cen-\ntury independently by Cretzfeldt and Jakob, CJD is aneurodegenerative disease causing a rapidly progressingdementia ending in death , usually within eight months\nof the onset of symptoms. It is also a very rare disease,affecting only about one in every million in the popula-tion through out the world. In the United States, CJD isthought to affect about 250 people each year. CJD affectsadults primarily between ages 50 and 75.\nSpongiform encephalopathies\nThe most obvious pathologic feature of CJD is the\nformation of numerous fluid-filled spaces in the brain(vacuoles) resulting in a sponge-like appearance. CJD isone of several human “spongiform encephalopathies,”diseases that produce this characteristic change in braintissue. Others are kuru; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinkerdisease, a genetic predominantly characterized by cere-bellar ataxia (a kind of movement disorder); and fatalfamilial insomnia , associated with progressive insomnia,\nautonomic system disfunction, and weakness caused bymotor system dysfunction.\nKuru was prevalent among the Fore people in Papua,\nNew Guinea, and spread from infected individuals aftertheir deaths through the practice of ritual cannibalism, inwhich the relatives of the dead person honored him byconsuming his organs, including the brain. Discovery ofthe infectious nature of kuru won the Nobel Prize forCarleton Gadjusek in 1976. The incubation period forkuru was between four to 30 years or more. While kuruhas virtually disappeared following the cessation of thesecannibalistic practices, several new cases continue toarise each year.\nCases of CJD have been grouped into three types:\nfamilial, iatrogenic, and sporadic.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 950Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 950• Familial CJD, representing 5–15% of cases, is inherited\nin an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that eitherparent may pass along the disease to a child, who maythen develop CJD later in life.\n• Iatrogenic CJD occurs when a person is infected during\na medical procedure, such as organ donation, bloodtransfusion , or brain surgery. The rise in organ dona-\ntion has increased this route of transmission; grafts ofinfected corneas and dura mater (the tissue covering thebrain) have been shown to transmit CJD. Anothersource is hormones concentrated from the pituitaryglands of cadavers, some of whom carried CJD, for usein people with growth hormone deficiencies. Iatrogenicinfection from exposure to nerve-containing tissue rep-resents a small fraction of all cases. The incubationperiod between exposure to the infectious agent is verylong and is estimated to be from less than 10 to morethan 30 years. It remains unlikely, but not impossible,that blood from patients with CJD is infectious to oth-ers by transfusion.\n• Sporadic CJD represents at least 85% of all cases. Spo-\nradic cases have no identifiable source of infection. Deathusually follows first symptoms within eight months.\nAnimal forms and “mad cow disease”\nSix forms of spongiform encephalopathies are\nknown to occur in other mammals: scrapie in sheep, rec-ognized for more than 200 years; chronic wasting diseasein elk and mule deer in Wyoming and Colorado; trans-missible mink encephalopathy; exotic ungulateencephalopathy in some types of zoo animals; felinespongiform encephalopathy in domestic cats; and bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows.\nBSE was first recognized in Britain in 1986. Besides\nthe spongiform changes in the brain, BSE causes demen-tia-like behavioral changes—hence the name “mad cowdisease.” BSE was thought to be an altered form ofscrapie, transmitted to cows when they were fed sheepoffal (slaughterhouse waste) as part of their feed, but it isnow thought to be more likely to be a primary cattle dis-ease spread by contaminated feed.\nThe use of slaughterhouse offal in animal feed has\nbeen common in many countries and has been practicedfor at least 50 years. The trigger for the BSE epidemic inGreat Britain seems to have come in the early 1980s,when the use of organic solvents for preparation of offalwas altered there. It is possible that these solvents hadbeen destroying the agent called a prion, thereby prevent-ing infection, and that the change in preparation proce-dure opened the way for the agent to “jump species” andcause BSE in cows that consumed scrapie-infected meal.The slaughter of infected (but not yet visibly sick) cowsat the end of their useful farm lives, and the use of their\ncarcasses for feed, spread the infection rapidly and wide-ly. For at least a year after BSE was first recognized inBritish herds, infected bovine remains continued to beincorporated into feed, spreading the disease still further.Although milk from infected cows has never been shownto pass the infectious agent, passage from infected moth-er to calf may have occurred through unknown means.\nBeginning in 1988, the British government took\nsteps to stop the spread of BSE, banning the use ofbovine offal in feed and other products and ordering theslaughter of infected cows. By then, the slow-actingagent had become epidemic in British herds. In 1992, itwas diagnosed in over 25,000 animals (1% of theBritish herd). By mid-1997, the cumulative number ofBSE cases in the United Kingdom had risen to morethan 170,000. The feeding ban did stem the tide of theepidemic; however, the number of new cases each weekfell from a peak of 1,000 in 1993 to less than 300 twoyears later.\nThe export of British feed and beef to member coun-\ntries was banned by the European Union, but cases ofBSE had developed in Europe by then as well; however,by mid-1997, only about 1,000 cases had been identified.In 1989, the United States banned import of British beefand began monitoring United States herds in 1990. Todate, no BSE has been detected in the United States, andonly one case has been reported in North America in acow imported to Canada from Great Britain.\nV ariant CJD: The human equivalent of mad cow\ndisease?\nFrom the beginning of the BSE epidemic, scientists\nand others in Britain feared that BSE might jump speciesagain to infect humans who had consumed infected beef.This, however, had never occurred in scrapie from sheep,a disease known from hundreds of years. In 1996, thefirst report of this possibility occurred and this fearseemed to be realized with the first cases of a new variantof Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, termed nvCJD, now justvCJD. Its victims are much younger than the 60–65 yearold average for CJD, and the time from symptom onset todeath has averaged 12 months or more instead of eight.The disease appears to cause more psychiatric symptomsearly on. EEG abnormalities characteristic of CJD arenot typically seen in vCJD.\nAs of July 2001, the total number of human cases of\nvCJD is 102. It is of major concern that the number ofcases per year seems to be increasing by a factor of 1.35each year. Almost all the cases have been found in GreatBritain with three in France, one in Ireland, and one sus-pected in Hong Kong (who spent time in Great Britain).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 951Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 951Evidence is growing stronger that vCJD is in fact\ncaused by BSE:\n• almost all of the cases so far have occurred in Great\nBritain, the location of the BSE epidemic.\n• BSE injected into monkeys produces a disease very\nsimilar to vCJD\n• BSE and vCJD produce the same brain lesions after the\nsame incubation period when injected into laboratorymice\n• brain proteins isolated from vCJD victims, but not from\nthe other forms of CJD, share similar molecular charac-teristics with brain proteins of animals that died fromBSE\nMany researchers now treat the BSE-vCJD connec-\ntion as solidly established.\nAssuming that BSE is the source, the question that\nhas loomed from the beginning has been is how manypeople will eventually be affected. Epidemiologicalmodels of infectious disease produce estimates rangingfrom less than one hundred (a level already broken) totens of thousands or more, depending on the assumptionsused by the modelers. The incubation period of vCJD inhumans is not known, nor are the genetic and environ-mental risk factors that influence susceptibility, nor thequantity of infectious agent needed to cause the disease.It is estimated that between one and two million infectedcattle have been eaten by humans, most in the earlieststages of the epidemic. Estimates cannot be based on thevery few cases that have developed so far. These casescould represent the very few people with the right combi-nation of exposure and susceptibility to a relatively fast-developing infection, or they could be the first few vic-tims of a slower-acting, more highly infectious agent.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nIt is clear that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by\nan infectious agent, but it is not yet clear what type ofagent that is. Originally assumed to be a virus, evidenceis accumulating that, instead, CJD is caused by a proteincalled a prion (PREE-on, for “proteinaceous infectiousparticle”) transmitted from victim to victim. The otherspongiform encephalopathies are also hypothesized to bedue to prion infection.\nIf this hypothesis is proved true, it would represent\none of the most radical new ideas in biology since thediscovery of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). All infec-tious diseases, in fact all life, uses nucleic acids—DNAor ribonucleic acid (RNA)—to code the instructionsneeded for reproduction. Inactivation of the nucleic acidsdestroys the capacity to reproduce. However, when these\nsame measures are applied to infected tissue fromspongiform encephalopathy victims, infectivity is notdestroyed. Furthermore, purification of infected tissue toconcentrate the infectious fraction yields protein, notnucleic acid. While it remains possible that some highlystable nucleic acid remains hidden within the purifiedprotein, this is seemingly less and less likely as furtherexperiments are done. The “prion hypothesis,” as it iscalled, is now widely accepted, at least provisionally, bymost researchers in the field. The most vocal proponentof the hypothesis, Stanley Prusiner, was awarded theNobel Prize in 1997 for his work in the prion diseases.\nA prion is an altered form of a normal brain protein.\nThe normal protein has a helical shape along part of itslength. In the prion form, a sheet structure replaces thehelix. According to the hypothesis, when the normalform interacts with the prion form, some of its helicalpart is converted to a sheet, thus creating a new prioncapable of transforming other normal forms. In this way,the disease process resembles crystallization more thantypical viral infection, in which the virus commands thehost’s cellular machinery to reproduce more of the virus.Build-up of the sheet form causes accumulation ofabnormal protein clumps and degeneration of brain cells,which is thought to cause the disease.\nThe brain protein affected by the prion, called PrP, is\npart of the membrane of brain cells, but its exact functionis unknown. It is composed of about 250 subunits, calledamino acids, coded for by a gene on chromosome 20.Slight genetic differences, called polymorphisms, giverise to two slightly different normal protein forms: sub-unit 129 is a “methionine” in one form, but is “valine” inthe other. A person may have all of one, all of the other,or a mixture of the two, depending on their genetic inher-itance. Both forms have the normal helical structure, andfunction normally. However, susceptibility to prion con-version is influenced by subunit 129: a person with amixture of forms is more resistant to conversion. All thecases of vCJD tested have had just methionine at 129.Exposure to the infectious agent is, of course, stillrequired for disease development. Prion diseases are notcontagious in the usual sense, and transmission from aninfected person to another person requires direct inocula-tion of infectious material.\nFamilial CJD, on the other hand, does not require\nexposure, but develops through the inheritance of other,more disruptive mutations in the gene for the normal PrPprotein. Researchers believe these mutations increase thelikelihood that the protein may more spontaneously“flip” to the sheet form; once created, these can then con-vert other normal-form molecules. The other two inherit-ed human prion diseases, Gerstmann-Straussler-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 952Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 952Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia, involve\ndifferent mutations in the same gene.\nThe large majority of CJD cases are sporadic, mean-\ning they have no known route of infection or genetic link.Causes of sporadic CJD are likely to be diverse and mayinclude spontaneous genetic mutation, spontaneous pro-tein changes, or unrecognized exposure to infectiousagents. It is highly likely that future research will identi-fy more risk factors associated with sporadic CJD.\nSymptoms\nAbout one in four people with CJD begin their ill-\nness with weakness, changes in sleep patterns, weightloss, or loss of appetite or sexual drive. A person withCJD may first complain of visual disturbances, includingdouble vision, blurry vision, or partial loss of vision.Some visual symptoms are secondary to cortical blind-ness related to death of nerve cells in the occipital lobe ofthe brain responsible for vision. This form of visual lossis unusual in that patients may be unaware that they areunable to see. These symptoms may appear weeks tomonths before the onset of dementia.\nThe most characteristic symptom of CJD is rapidly\nprogressing dementia, or loss of mental function.Dementia is marked by:\n• memory losses• impaired abstraction and planning• language and comprehension disturbances\n• poor judgment\n• disorientation• decreased attention and increased restlessness• personality changes and psychosis• hallucinations\nMuscle spasms and jerking movements, called\nmyoclonus, are also a prominent symptom of CJD. Bal-ance and coordination disturbance (ataxia), is common inCJD, and is more pronounced in nvCJD. Stiffness, diffi-culty moving, and other features representing Parkinson’s\ndisease are seen and can progress to akinetic mutism ,\nwhich is a state of being unable to speak or move.\nDiagnosis\nCJD is diagnosed by a clinical neurological exam\nand electroencephalography (EEG), which shows char-\nacteristic spikes called triphasic sharp waves. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography\nscans (CT) should be done to exclude other forms of\ndementia, and in CJD typically shows atrophy or loss ofbrain tissue. Lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may bedone to rule out other causes of dementia (as cell count,\nchemical analysis, and other routine tests are normal inCJD) and to identify elevated levels of marker proteinsknown as 14-3-3. Another marker, neuron-specific eno-lase, may also be increased in CJD. CJD is conclusivelydiagnosed after death by brain autopsy . Scientists are\ninvestigating whether testing lymphatic tissue such as thetonsil may be an early tool in vCJD diagnosis. Addition-ally, recent studies have suggested that other blood testsmay be useful as well.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for CJD, and no treatment that\nslows the progression of the disease. Drug therapy andnursing care are aimed at minimizing psychiatric symp-toms and increasing patient comfort. However, the rapidprogression of CJD frustrates most attempts at treatment,since decreasing cognitive function and more prominentbehavioral symptoms develop so quickly. Despite thegenerally grim prognosis, a few CJD patients progressmore slowly and live longer than the average; for thesepatients, treatment will be more satisfactory. Scientistsare investigating whether some medicines that can“break” the abnormal protein form may be useful andwhether a vaccine could help.\nPrognosis\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease is invariably fatal, with\ndeath following symptom onset by an average of eightmonths.

Individuals with this syndrome have\nunusual facial features, poor muscle tone(hypotonia),small head size (microcephaly), and mental\nretardation . A classic feature of the syndrome is the cat-\nlike cry made by infants with this disorder.\nDescription\nDr. Jerome Lejeune first described cri du chat syn-\ndrome in 1963. The syndrome is named for the cat-likecry made by infants with this genetic disorder. Cri du\nchat means “cry of the cat” in French. This unusual cry is\ncaused by abnormal development of the larynx (organ inthe throat responsible for voice production). Cri du chatsyndrome is also called “5p minus syndrome” because itis caused by a deletion, or removal, of genetic materialfrom chromosome 5. The deletion that causes cri du chatsyndrome occurs on the short or “p” arm of chromosome5. This deleted genetic material is vital for normal devel-opment. Absence of this material results in the featuresassociated with cri du chat syndrome.\nA high-pitched mewing cry during infancy is a classic\nfeature of cri du chat. Infants with cri du chat also typicallyhave low birth weight, slow growth, a small head (micro-cephaly) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants with cridu chat may have congenital heart defects. Individuals withcri du chat syndrome have language difficulties, delayedmotor skill development, and mental retardation. Behav-ioral problems may also develop as the child matures.\nIt has been estimated that cri du chat syndrome\noccurs in one of every 50,000 live births. According tothe 5p minus Society, approximately 50–60 children areborn with cri du chat syndrome in the United States eachyear. It can occur in all races and in both sexes.\nCauses and symptoms\nCri du chat is the result of a chromosome abnormali-\nty—a deleted piece of chromosomal material on chromo-some 5. In 90% of patients with cri du chat syndrome,the deletion is sporadic. This means that it happens ran-domly and is not hereditary. If a child has cri du chat dueto a sporadic deletion, the chance the parents could haveanother child with cri du chat is 1%. In approximately10% of patients with cri du chat, there is a hereditarychromosomal rearrangement that causes the deletion. If aparent has this rearrangement, the risk for them to have achild with cri du chat is greater than 1%.\nAn abnormal larynx causes the unusual cat-like cry\nmade by infants that is a hallmark feature of the syndrome.As children with cri du chat get older, the cat-like crybecomes less noticeable. This can make the diagnosismore difficult in older patients. In addition to the cat-like\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 954Cri du chat syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 954cry, individuals with cri du chat also have unusual facial\nfeatures. These facial differences can be very subtle ormore obvious. Microcephaly (small head size) is common.During infancy many patients with cri du chat do not gainweight or grow normally. Approximately 30% of infantswith cri du chat have a congenital heart defect. Hypotonia(poor muscle tone) is also common, leading to problemswith eating and slow, but normal, development. Mentalretardation is present in all patients with cri du chat, butthe degree of mental retardation varies between patients.\nDiagnosis\nDuring infancy, the diagnosis of cri du chat syn-\ndrome is strongly suspected if the characteristic cat-likecry is heard. If a child has this unusual cry or other fea-tures seen in cri du chat syndrome, chromosome testingshould be performed. Chromosome analysis provides thedefinitive diagnosis of cri du chat syndrome and can beperformed from a blood test. Chromosome analysis, alsocalled “karyotyping,” involves staining the chromosomesand examining them under a microscope. In some casesthe deletion of material from chromosome 5 can be easi-ly seen. In other cases, further testing must be performed.FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) is a specialtechnique that detects very small deletions. The majorityof the deletions that cause cri du chat syndrome can beidentified using the FISH technique.KEY TERMS\nAminocentesis —A procedure performed at 16–18\nweeks of pregnancy in which a needle is insertedthrough a woman’s abdomen into her uterus todraw out a small sample of the amniotic fluid fromaround the baby.

Inflammation refersto swelling, redness, and loss of normal function. Thereis evidence that the inflammation is caused by variousproducts of the immune system that attack the body itselfinstead of helpfully attacking a foreign invader (a virusor bacteria, for example). The inflammation of Crohn’sdisease most commonly affects the last part of the ileum(a section of the small intestine), and often includes thelarge intestine (the colon). However, inflammation mayalso occur in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract,affecting the mouth, esophagus, or stomach. Crohn’s dis-ease differs from ulcerative colitis , the other major type\nof IBD, in two important ways:\n• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease may be discontin-\nuous, meaning that areas of involvement in the intestinemay be separated by normal, unaffected segments ofintestine. The affected areas are called “regional enteri-tis,” while the normal areas are called “skip areas.”\n• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease affects all the lay-\ners of the intestinal wall, while ulcerative colitis affectsonly the lining of the intestine.\nAlso, ulcerative colitis does not usually involve the\nsmall intestine; in rare cases it involves the terminalileum (so-called “backwash” ileitis).\nIn addition to inflammation, Crohn’s disease causes\nulcerations, or irritated pits in the intestinal wall. Thesepits occur because the inflammation has made areas oftissue shed.\nCrohn’s disease may be diagnosed at any age,\nalthough most diagnoses are made between the ages of15–35. About 0.02–0.04% of the population suffers fromthis disorder, with men and women having an equalchance of being stricken. Whites are more frequentlyaffected than other racial groups, and people of Jewish ori-gin are between three and six times more likely to sufferfrom IBD. IBD runs in families; an IBD patient has a 20%chance of having other relatives who are fellow sufferers.\nCrohn’s disease is a chronic disorder. While the\nsymptoms can be improved, a patient will not be com-pletely cured of the underlying disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown. No infec-\ntious agent (virus, bacteria, or fungi) has been identifiedas the cause of Crohn’s disease. Still, some researchershave theorized that some type of infection may haveoriginally been responsible for triggering the immunesystem, resulting in the continuing and out-of-controlcycle of inflammation that occurs in Crohn’s disease.Other evidence for a disorder of the immune systemincludes the high incidence of other immune disordersthat may occur along with Crohn’s disease.\nThe first symptoms of Crohn’s disease include diar-\nrhea ,fever , abdominal pain , inability to eat, weight loss,\nand fatigue . Some patients have severe pain that mimics\nappendicitis . It is rare, however, for patients to notice\nblood in their bowel movements. Because Crohn’s diseaseseverely limits the ability of the affected intestine to absorb\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 956Crohn’s diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 956the nutrients from food, a patient with Crohn’s disease can\nhave signs of malnutrition , depending on the amount of\nintestine affected and the duration of the disease.\nThe combination of severe inflammation, ulceration,\nand scarring that occurs in Crohn’s disease can result inserious complications, including obstruction, abscess\nformation, and fistula formation.\nAn obstruction is a blockage in the intestine. This\nobstruction prevents the intestinal contents from passingbeyond the point of the blockage. The intestinal contents“back up,” resulting in constipation , vomiting, and\nintense pain. Although rare in Crohn’s disease (becauseof the increased thickness of the intestinal wall due toswelling and scarring), a severe bowel obstruction canresult in an intestinal wall perforation (a hole in the intes-tine). Such a hole in the intestinal wall would allow theintestinal contents, usually containing bacteria, to enterthe abdomen. This complication could result in a severe,life-threatening infection.\nAbcess formation is the development of a walled-off\npocket of infection. A patient with an abscess will havebouts of fever, increased abdominal pain, and may have alump or mass that can be felt through the wall of theabdomen.\nFistula formation is the formation of abnormal chan-\nnels. These channels may connect one area of the intes-tine to another neighboring section of intestine. Fistualsmay join an area of the intestine to the vagina or bladder,or they may drain an area of the intestine through theskin. Abscesses and fistulas commonly affect the areaaround the anus and rectum (the very last portions of thecolon allowing waste to leave the body). These abnormalconnections allow the bacteria that normally live in theintestine to enter other areas of the body, causing poten-tially serious infections.\nPatients suffering from Crohn’s disease also have a\nsignificant chance of experiencing other disorders. Someof these may relate specifically to the intestinal disease,and others appear to have some relationship to the imbal-anced immune system. The faulty absorption state of thebowel can result in gallstones and kidney stones .\nInflamed areas in the abdomen may press on the tube thatdrains urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).Ureter compression can make urine back up into the kid-ney, enlarge the ureter and kidney, and can potentiallylead to kidney damage. Patients with Crohn’s diseasealso frequently suffer from:\n• arthritis (inflammation of the joints)• spondylitis (inflammation of the vertebrae, the bones of\nthe spine)\n• ulcers of the mouth and skin• painful, red bumps on the skin\n• inflammation of several eye areas\n• inflammation of the liver, gallbladder, and/or the chan-\nnels (ducts) that carry bile between and within the liver,gallbladder, and intestine\nThe chance of developing cancer of the intestine is\ngreater than normal among patients with Crohn’s dis-ease, although this chance is not as high as among thosepatients with ulcerative colitis\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is first suspected based on a patient’s\nsymptoms. Blood tests may reveal an increase in certaintypes of white blood cells, an indication that some typeof inflammation is occurring in the body. The blood testsmay also reveal anemia and other signs of malnutritiondue to malabsorption (low blood protein; variations in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 957Crohn’s disease\nA barium x-ray showing the colon of a patient with Crohn’s\ndisease where the large and small intestines join (bottomleft).

Stool samples may be examined to make surethat no infectious agent is causing the diarrhea, and tosee if the waste contains blood.\nDuring an endoscopic exam, a doctor passes a flexi-\nble tube with a tiny, fiber-optic camera device throughthe rectum and into the colon. The doctor can then care-fully examine the lining of the intestine for signs ofinflammation and ulceration that might suggest Crohn’sdisease. A tiny sample (a biopsy) of the intestine canalso be taken through the endoscope, and the tissue willbe examined under a microscope for evidence ofCrohn’s disease.KEY TERMS\nAbscess —A walled-off pocket of pus caused by\ninfection.\nEndoscope —A medical instrument that can be\npassed into an area of the body (the bladder orintestine, for example) to allow examination ofthat area. The endoscope usually has a fiber-opticcamera that allows a greatly magnified image tobe shown on a television screen viewed by theoperator. Many endoscopes also allow the opera-tor to retrieve a small sample (biopsy) of the areabeing examined to more closely view the tissueunder a microscope.\nFistule —An abnormal channel that creates an\nopen passageway between two structures that donot normally connect.\nGastrointestinal tract —The entire length of the\ndigestive system, running from the stomach,through the small intestine, large intestine, and outthe rectum and anus.\nImmune system —The body system responsible for\nproducing various cells and chemicals that fightinfection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other for-eign invaders. In autoimmune disease, these cellsand chemicals turn against the body itself.\nInflammation —The result of the body’s attempts\nto fight off and wall off an area that is infected.Inflammation results in the classic signs of red-ness, heat, swelling, and loss of function.\nObstruction —A blockage.\nUlceration —A pitted area or break in the continu-\nity of a surface such as skin or mucous membrane.X rays can be helpful for diagnosis, and also for\ndetermining how much of the intestine is involved in thedisease. For these x rays, the patient must either drink achalky solution containing barium, or receive a barium\nenema (a solution that is administered through the rec-\ntum). Barium helps to “light up” the intestine, allowingmore detail to be seen on the resulting x rays.\nWhile Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are sim-\nilar, they are also very different. Although it can be diffi-cult to determine whether a patient has Crohn’s diseaseor ulcerative colitis, it is important to make every effortto distinguish between these two diseases. Because thelong-term complications of the diseases are different,treatment will depend on careful diagnosis of the specificIBD present.\nTreatment\nTreatments for Crohn’s disease try to reduce the\nunderlying inflammation, the resulting malabsorption/malnutrition, the uncomfortable symptoms of crampyabdominal pain and diarrhea, and the possible complica-tions (obstructions, abscesses, and fistulas).\nInflammation can be treated with a drug called sul-\nfasalazine. Sulfasalazine is made up of two parts. One partis related to the sulfa antibiotics ; the other part is a form\nof the anti-inflammatory chemical, salicylic acid (relatedto aspirin ). Sulfasalazine is not well absorbed from the\nintestine, so it stays mostly within the intestine, where it isbroken down into its components. It is believed that thesalicylic acid component actively treats Crohn’s disease byfighting inflammation. Some patients do not respond tosulfasalazine, and require steroid medications (such asprednisone). Steroids, however, must be used carefully toavoid the complications of these drugs, includingincreased risk of infection and weakening of bones ( osteo-\nporosis ). Some very potent immunosuppressive drugs,\nwhich interfere with the products of the immune systemand can hopefully decrease inflammation, may be used forthose patients who do not improve on steroids.\nA new drug called infliximab (Remicade) appears to\nbe a powerful treatment for Crohn’s disease, particularlyfor patients who have not responded well to other formsof treatment. Infliximab is administered through infusion,and consists of a monoclonal antibody that interferes withthe inflammatory process mediated by tumor necrosisfactor-alpha (TNF-a). Patients taking infliximab seem tobe able to decrease their use of steroid medications, andrequire fewer surgical interventions. Furthermore, inflix-imab is the first medication approved for treating fistulas.Unfortunately, infliximab can only be used on a short-term basis, because its interference with TNF-a activitycan also predispose patients to serious infection. More\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 958Crohn’s diseaseGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 958research is needed to try to harness the benefits of inflix-\nimab, while avoiding the potential complications.\nSerious cases of malabsorption/malnutrition may\nneed to be treated by providing nutritional supplements.These supplements must be in a form that can beabsorbed from the damaged, inflamed intestine. Somepatients find that certain foods are hard to digest, includ-ing milk, large quantities of fiber, and spicy foods. Whenpatients are suffering from an obstruction, or during peri-ods of time when symptoms of the disease are at theirworst, they may need to drink specially formulated, high-calorie liquid supplements. Those patients who areseverely ill may need to receive their nutrition through a\nneedle inserted in a vein (intravenously), or even by atiny tube (a catheter) inserted directly into a major veinin the chest.\nA number of medications are available to help\ndecrease the cramping and pain associated with Crohn’sdisease. These include loperamide, tincture of opium,and codeine. Some fiber preparations (methylcellulose orpsyllium) may be helpful, although some patients do nottolerate them well.\nThe first step in treating an obstruction involves gen-\neral attempts to decrease inflammation with sul-fasalazine, steroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. Apatient with a severe obstruction will have to stop takingall food and drink by mouth, allowing the bowel to“rest.” Abscesses and other infections will require antibi-otics. Surgery may be required to repair an obstructionthat does not resolve on its own, to remove an abscess, orto repair a fistula. Such surgery may involve the removalof a section of the intestine. In extremely severe cases ofCrohn’s disease that do not respond to treatment, apatient may need to have the entire large intestineremoved (an operation called a colectomy). In this case,a piece of the remaining small intestine is pulled throughan opening in the abdomen. This bit of intestine is fash-ioned surgically to allow a special bag to be placed overit. This bag catches the body’s waste, which no longercan be passed through the large intestine and out of theanus. This opening, which will remain in place for life, iscalled an ileostomy.\nPrognosis\nCrohn’s disease is a life-long illness. The severity of\nthe disease can vary, and a patient can experience periodsof time when the disease is not active and he or she issymptom-free. However, the complications and risks ofCrohn’s disease tend to increase over time. Well over60% of all patients with Crohn’s disease will requiresurgery, and about half of these patients will requiremore than one operation over time. About 5–10% of allCrohn’s patients will die of their disease, primarily due\nto massive infection.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGlickman, Robert. “Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Ulcerative\nColitis and Crohn’s Disease.” In Harrison’s Principles of\nInternal Medicine, ed.

Typically, it\narises from a viral infection of the larynx (voice box) andis associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms suchas a runny nose and cough . The key symptom is a harsh\nbarking cough. Croup is usually not serious, and mostchildren recover within a few days. In a small percentageof cases, a child develops breathing difficulties and mayneed medical attention.\nDescription\nAt one time, the term croup was primarily associated\nwith diphtheria , a life-threatening respiratory infection.\nOwing to widespread vaccinations, diphtheria hasbecome rare in the United States, and croup currently\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 959CroupGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 959refers to a mild viral infection of the larynx. Croup is also\nknown as laryngotracheitis, a medical term that describesthe inflammation of the trachea (windpipe) and larynx.\nParainfluenza viruses are the typical root cause of\nthe infection, but influenza (flu) and cold viruses may\nsometimes be responsible. All of these viruses are highlycontagious and easily transmitted between individualsvia sneezing and coughing. Children between the ages ofthree months and six years are usually affected, with thegreatest incidence at one to two years of age. Croup canoccur at any time of the year, but it is most typical duringearly autumn and winter. The characteristic harsh bark-ing of a croupy cough can be very distressing, but itrarely indicates a serious problem. Most children withcroup can be treated very effectively at home; however,1–5% may require medical treatment.\nCroup may sometimes be confused with more seri-\nous conditions, such as epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis.\nThese ailments arise from bacterial infection and mustreceive medical treatment.\nCauses and symptoms\nOwing to an upper respiratory viral infection, the\nlarynx and trachea may become inflamed or swollen. Thehallmark sign of croup is a harsh, barking cough. Thiscough may be preceded by one to three days of symp-toms that resemble a slight cold. A croupy cough is oftenaccompanied by a runny nose, hoarseness, and a lowfever . When the child inhales, there may be a raspy or\nhigh-pitched noise, called stridor , owing to the narrowed\nairway and accumulated mucus. In the presence of stri-dor, medical attention is required.\nHowever, the airway rarely narrows so much that\nbreathing is impeded. Symptoms usually abate complete-ly within a few days. Medical treatment may be sought ifthe child’s symptoms do not respond to home treatment.\nEmergency medical treatment is required immediate-\nly if the child has difficulty breathing, swallowing, or talk-ing; develops a high fever (103°F/39.4°C or more); seemsunalert or confused; or has pale or blue-tinged skin.\nDiagnosis\nCroup is diagnosed based on the symptoms. If\nsymptoms are particularly severe, or do not respond totreatment, an x ray of the throat area is done to assess thepossibility of epiglottitis or other blockage of the airway.\nTreatment\nHome treatment is the usual method of managing\ncroup symptoms. It is important that the child is keptcomfortable and calm to the best degree possible, because\ncrying can make symptoms seem worse. Humid air canhelp a child with croup feel more comfortable. Recom-mended methods include sitting in a steamy bathroomwith the hot water running or using a cool-water vaporizeror humidifier. Breathing may also be eased by going out-side into cooler air. The child should drink frequently inorder to stay well hydrated. To treat any fever, the childmay be given an appropriate dose of acetaminophen\n(like Tylenol). Antihistamines and decongestants are\nineffective in treating croup. Children under the age of 18should not be given aspirin, as it may cause Reye’s syn-\ndrome , a life-threatening disease of the brain.\nIf the child does not respond to home treatment,\nmedical treatment at a doctor’s office or an emergencyroom could be necessary. Based on the severity of symp-toms and the response to treatment, the child may need tobe admitted to a hospital.\nFor immediate symptom relief, epinephrine may be\nadministered as an inhaled aerosol. Effects last for up totwo hours, but there is a possibility that symptoms mayreturn. For that reason, the child is kept under supervi-sion for three or more hours. Another effective drug is aglucocorticoid, dexamethasone. This drug requires moretime to take effect, but is longer lasting. It can be admin-istered orally or as an injection. Another glucocorticoid,budesonide, has been used outside the United States fortreating croup. It is administered as an inhaled aerosoland has been shown to be effective; however, it is notavailable as a treatment option in the United States.\nOf the 1–5% of children requiring medical treat-\nment, approximately 1% need respiratory support. Suchsupport involves intubation (inserting a tube into the tra-chea) and oxygen administration.\nAlternative treatment\nBotanical/herbal medicines can be helpful in healing\nthe cough that is commonly associated with croup. Sev-eral herbs to consider for cough treatment includeaniseed ( Pimpinella anisum ), sundew ( Drosera rotundi-\nfolia ), thyme ( Thymus vulgaris ), and wild cherry bark\n(Prunus serotina ).

This\nphysical characteristic causes people with cryoglobulinto have symptoms during cold weather: blanching,numbness, and pain in their fingers or toes (Raynaud’s\nphenomenon); bleeding into the skin (purpura); and painin joints (arthralgia). People with these symptoms or anyother symptoms that appear in cold weather should betested for cryoglobulin.\nDiseases that cause the body to make extra or abnor-\nmal proteins are often associated with cryoglobulin.These diseases include cancers involving white bloodcells, infections, autoimmune disorders , and rheuma-\ntoid diseases.\nThis test provides information about the cause of\nsymptoms in a person who already has a disease process.It doesn’t diagnose a specific disease or monitor thecourse of a disease.\nPrecautions\nThis test is not a screening test for disease in a per-\nson without symptoms.\nDescription\nLaboratory testing for cryoglobulin is based on the\nfact that cryoglobulin clumps when cooled and dissolveswhen warmed. The test is done on a person’s serum (theyellow liquid part of blood that separates from the cellsafter the blood clots). The serum is kept warm from thetime drawn until the cells and the serum are separated inthe laboratory. The serum is placed at 33.8°F (1°C) forone to seven days. If there is clumping, cryoglobulins arepresent. The amount of cryoglobulins is determined bymeasuring the amount of clumping. Negative tests arechecked through seven days.\nAdditional testing is done to find out what kind of\ncryoglobulin protein is present. There are three kinds ofcryoglobulin, each associated with different diseases.\nThe test, also called the cold sensitivity antibodies\ntest, is covered by insurance when medically necessary.Results are usually available the following day.\nPreparation\nThis test requires 15–20 mL of blood. A healthcare\nworker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper arm,locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 961Cryoglobulin testGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 961needle into that vein.

    "title": "Cryotherapy",
    "content": "Cryotherapy\nDefinition\nCryotherapy is a technique that uses an extremely\ncold liquid or instrument to freeze and destroy abnormalskin cells that require removal. The technique has been inuse since the turn of the century, but modern techniqueshave made it widely available to dermatologists and pri-mary care doctors. The technique is also calledcryosurgery.\nPurpose\nCryotherapy can be employed to destroy a variety of\nbenign skin growths, such as warts , pre-cancerous lesions\n(such as actinic keratoses), and malignant lesions (such asbasal cell and squamous cell cancers). The goal ofcryotherapy is to freeze and destroy targeted skin growthswhile preserving the surrounding skin from injury.\nPrecautions\nCryotherapy is not recommended for certain areas of\nthe body because of the danger of destruction of tissue orunacceptable scarring. These areas include: skin thatoverlies nerves, the corners of the eyes, the fold of skinbetween the nose and lip, the skin surrounding the nos-trils, and the border between the lips and the rest of theface. Lesions that are suspected or known to be malig-\nnant melanoma should not be treated with cryotherapy,\nbut should instead be removed surgically. Similarly, basalcell or squamous cell carcinomas that have reappeared atthe site of a previously treated tumor should also beremoved surgically. If it remains unclear whether agrowth is benign or malignant, a sample of tissue shouldbe removed for analysis (biopsy) by a pathologist beforeany attempts to destroy the lesion with cryotherapy. Careshould be taken in people with diabetes or certain circula-tion problems when cryotherapy is considered forgrowths located on their lower legs, ankles, and feet. Inthese patients, healing can be poor and the risk of infec-tion can be higher than for other patients.\nDescription\nThere are three main techniques to performing\ncryotherapy. In the simplest technique, usually reservedfor warts and other benign skin growths, the physician\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 962CryotherapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 962will dip a cotton swab or other applicator into a cup con-\ntaining a “cryogen,” such as liquid nitrogen, and apply itdirectly to the skin growth to freeze it. At a temperature of-320°F (-196°C), liquid nitrogen is the coldest cryogenavailable. The goal is to freeze the skin growth as quicklyas possible, and then let it thaw slowly to cause maximumdestruction of the skin cells. A second application may benecessary depending on the size of the growth. In anothercryotherapy technique, a device is used to direct a smallspray of liquid nitrogen or other cryogen directly onto theskin growth. Freezing may last from five to 20 seconds,depending on the size of the lesion. A second freeze-thawcycle may be required. Sometimes, the physician willinsert a small needle connected to a thermometer into thelesion to make certain the lesion is cooled to a lowenough temperature to guarantee maximum destruction.In a third option, liquid nitrogen or another cryogen is cir-culated through a probe to cool it to low temperatures.The probe is then brought into direct contact with the skinlesion to freeze it. The freeze time can take two to threetimes longer than with the spray technique.\nPreparation\nExtensive preparation prior to cryotherapy is not\nrequired. The area to be treated should be clean and dry,but sterile preparation is not necessary. Patients shouldknow that they will experience some pain at the time of\nthe freezing, but local anesthesia is usually not required.The physician may want to reduce the size of certaingrowths, such as warts, prior to the cryotherapy proce-dure, and may have patients apply salicylic acid prepara-tions to the growth over several weeks. Sometimes, thephysician will pare away some of the tissue using adevice called a curette or a scalpel.\nAftercare\nRedness, swelling, and the formation of a blister at the\nsite of cryotherapy are all expected results of the treatment.A gauze dressing is applied and patients should wash thesite three or four times daily while fluid continues to oozefrom the wound, usually for five to 14 days. A dry crustthen forms that falls off by itself. Wounds on the head and\nneck may take four to six weeks to heal, but those on thebody, arms, and legs can take longer. Some patients experi-ence pain at the site following the treatment. This can usu-ally be eased with acetaminophen (Tylenol), though in\nsome cases a stronger pain reliever may be required.\nRisks\nCryotherapy poses little risk and can be well-tolerat-\ned by elderly and other patients who are not good candi-KEY TERMS\nActinic keratosis —A crusty, scaly pre-cancerous\nskin lesion caused by damage from the sun. Fre-quently treated with cryotherapy.\nBasal cell cancer —The most common form of skin\ncancer; it usually appears as one or several nod-ules having a central depression. It rarely spreads(metasticizes), but is locally invasive.\nCryogen —A substance with a very low boiling\npoint, such as liquid nitrogen, used in cryotherapytreatment.\nMelanoma —The most dangerous form of skin\ncancer. It should not be treated with cryotherapy,but should be removed surgically instead.\nSquamous cell cancer —A form of skin cancer that\nusually originates in sun-damaged areas or pre-existing lesions; at first local and superficial, itmay later spread to other areas of the body.\ndates for other surgical procedures. As with other surgi-\ncal procedures, there is some risk of scarring, infection,and damage to underlying skin and tissue. These risksare generally minimal in the hands of experienced usersof cryotherapy.\nNormal results\nSome redness, swelling, blistering and oozing of\nfluid are all common results of cryotherapy. Healing timecan vary by the site treated and the cryotherapy techniqueused. When cryogen is applied directly to the growth,healing may occur in three weeks. Growths treated on thehead and neck with the spray technique may take four tosix weeks to heal; growths treated on other areas of thebody may take considerably longer. Cryotherapy boastshigh success rates in permanently removing skin growths;even for malignant lesions such as squamous cell andbasal cell cancers, studies have shown a cure rate of up to98%. For certain types of growths, such as some forms ofwarts, repeat treatments over several weeks are necessaryto prevent the growth’s return.\nAbnormal results\nAlthough cryotherapy is a relatively low risk proce-\ndure, some side effects may occur as a result of the treat-ment. They include:\n• Infection. Though uncommon, infection is more likely\non the lower legs where healing can take several months.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 963CryotherapyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 963• Pigmentary changes. Both hypopigmentation (lighten-\ning of the skin) and hyperpigmentation (darkening of\nthe skin) are possible after cryotherapy. Both generallylast a few months, but can be longer lasting.\n• Nerve damage.

    "title": "Cryptococcosis",
    "content": "Cryptococcosis\nDefinition\nCryptococcosis is an infection caused by inhaling\nthe fungus Cryptococcus neoformans . It is one of the dis-\neases most often affecting AIDS patients. Cryptococco-\nsis may be limited to the lungs, but frequently spreadsthroughout the body. Although almost any organ can beinfected, the fungus is often fatal if it infects the nervoussystem where it causes an inflammation of the mem-branes covering the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ).\nDescription\nThe fungus causing cryptococcus, C. neoformans ,i s\nfound worldwide in soil contaminated with pigeon orother bird droppings. It has also been found on unwashedraw fruit. Cryptococcosis is a rare disease in healthyindividuals, but is the most common fungal infectionaffecting people with AIDS.\nPeople with Hodgkin’s disease or who are taking\nlarge doses of drugs that suppress the functioning of theimmune system ( corticosteroids ,chemotherapy drugs)\nare also more susceptible to cryptococcal infection.Cryptococcosis is also called cryptococcal meningitis(when the brain is infected), Busse-Buschke disease,European blastomycosis , torular meningitis, or torulosis.\nCauses and symptoms\nOnce the cryptococcal fungus reaches the lungs,\nthree things can happen. The immune system can healthe body without medical intervention, the disease canstay localized in the lungs, or it can spread throughoutthe body. In healthy people with normally functioningimmune systems, the body usually heals itself, and theinfected person notices no symptoms and has no compli-cations (asymptomatic). The disease does not spreadfrom one person to another.\nCryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection that\nputs people with immune system diseases at higher riskof developing more serious forms of the disease. In theUnited States, 6–10% of all patients with AIDS get cryp-tococcosis.\nIf the body does not heal itself, the fungus begins to\ngrow in the lungs and form nodules that can be seen onchest x rays. In the early stages of infection, an individ-ual usually only exhibits symptoms of a respiratoryinfection, such as a dry cough , so the disease is rarely\ndiagnosed.\nThe fungus can remain dormant in the lungs and\nproduce an active infection later if the immune system isweakened. If the disease becomes active, it can causecryptococcal pneumonia in the lungs. Unfortunately,\nhowever, cryptococcal pneumonia has symptoms similarto other pneumonias (cough, chest pain , difficulty\nbreathing), making it difficult to accurately diagnose.The infection can spread to other parts of the body, par-ticularly the brain and central nervous system.\nMost patients are not diagnosed as having crypto-\ncoccosis until they show signs of cryptococcal meningi-tis, or infection of the membranes surrounding the brainand spinal cord. Symptoms appear gradually over a peri-od of two to four weeks. Fever and headache are the\nmost common symptoms, occurring in about 85% ofpatients. Nausea, vomiting, unwanted weight loss, andfatigue are also common. Other symptoms seen in\n25–30% of patients are blurred vision, stiff neck, aver-sion to light, and seizures. Since the symptoms of classic\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 964CryptococcosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 964meningitis, such as stiff neck and aversion to light, do not\noccur in many patients, diagnosis is often delayed. Inaddition to meningitis, inflammation of the brain(encephalitis ) and brain lesions called cryptococcomas\nor tortulomas can also develop.\nIn addition to the brain, the cryptococcal infection\ncan spread to the kidneys, bone marrow, heart, adrenalglands, lymph nodes, urinary tract, blood, and skin.Often times preceding the development of cryptococcalmeningitis, painless rashes and lesions that mimic other\nskin diseases, such as molluscum contagiosum , may\ndevelop. A small percentage of patients with brain infec-tions show infections in other organs as well.\nDiagnosis\nPhysicians who regularly work with AIDS patients\nhave the most experience in diagnosing cryptococcosis.The preferred methods of diagnosis use simple and veryaccurate blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests thatdetect the presence of an antigen produced by the fungus.The cerebrospinal fluid test is generally more sensitive todetecting the meningitis form of the infection. CSF iscollected during a procedure called a lumbar puncture,during which an anesthetic is applied to a small area ofthe back near the spine and a needle is used to withdrawa sample of cerebrospinal fluid from the space betweenthe vertebrae and the spinal cord. Once obtained, a smallamount of ink (called India ink) is added to a sample ofCSF or a sample prepared from skin lesions . If the fun-\ngus is present, it will become visible when the ink bindsto the capsule or covering that surrounds the fungus.Faster results are obtained with the India ink test, but it isless accurate than the blood test (75–85% accuracy com-pared to 99% accuracy with the blood test) because somestrains are not visible using this method. Antigen testsare routinely recommended for non-symptomaticpatients with advanced AIDS.\nAnother way to diagnose cryptococcosis is to cul-\nture a sample of sputum, tissue from a lung biopsy ,o r\nCSF in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. Cultures arealso done to assess the effectiveness of treatment.\nChest x rays are useful in assessing lung damage and\nmay reveal a single mass or multiple distinct nodules, butthe x ray alone does not lead to a definitive diagnosis ofcryptococcosis.\nTreatment\nOnce cryptococcosis is diagnosed, treatment begins\nwith amphotericin B (Fungizone), sometimes in combi-nation with 5-flucytosine (Ancobon). Amphotericin B isa powerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic sideeffects, such as kidney toxicity and lower concentrations\nof an important blood component called hemoglobin.This medication can also cause fever, chills, nausea and\nvomiting ,diarrhea , headache, and muscle aches. Treat-\nment is generally given intravenously during a hospitalstay and continues until the patient is stable or improving(no more than two to three weeks). 5-flucytosine is givenorally. Patients may also receive other medication tominimize the side effects from these drugs.\nAmphotericin B, with or without 5-flucytosine, is\ngiven for several weeks until the patient is stable, afterwhich the patient receives oral fluconazole (Diflucan).Fluconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal drug with fewserious side effects. Patient with AIDS must continue tak-ing fluconazole for the rest of their lives to prevent arelapse of cryptococcosis. Sometimes fluconazole isgiven to patients with advanced AIDS as a preventative(prophylactic) measure.\nBecause of the high cost of fluconazole, the manu-\nfacturer of the drug, Pfizer, has established a financialassistance plan to make the drug available at lower costto those who meet certain criteria. Patients needing thisdrug should ask their doctors about this program.\nPrognosis\nUntreated cryptococcosis is always fatal. The acute\nmortality rate for patients with AIDS is 10–25%. Mostdeaths are attributable to cryptococcal meningitis andoccur within two weeks after diagnosis. For AIDSpatients who do not receive continued suppressive thera-py (fluconazole), the relapse rate is 50–60% within sixmonths and a shortened life expectancy. Once the crypto-coccosis infection has been successfully treated, individ-uals may be left with a variety of neurologic symptoms,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 965Cryptococcosis\nThis lesion appearing on this person’s body is due to expo-\nsure of the C. neoformans fungus.

Protozoa are\na group of parasites that infect the human intestine, andinclude the better known Giardia . Cryptosporidia was first\nidentified in 1976 as a cause of disease in humans.\nDescription\nCryptosporidia are normally passed in the feces of\ninfected persons and animals in the form of cysts. Thecysts can remain in the ground and water for months, andwhen ingested produce symptoms after maturing in theintestine and the bile ducts. When viewed under themicroscope, they appear as small bluish-staining roundbodies. Most common sources of infection are otherhumans, water supplies, or reservoirs. These are contam-inated by animals that defecate in these areas. An out-break in Milwaukee in 1993 in which over 400,000 per-sons were affected was traced to the city’s water supply.Cysts of Cryptosporidia are extremely resistant to the\ndisinfectants that are commonly used in most water treat-ment plants and are incompletely removed by filtration.\nMost persons who experience significant symptoms\nhave an altered immune system, and suffer from diseasessuch as AIDS and cancer . However, as shown in the\nMilwaukee outbreak, even those with normal immunitycan experience symptoms.\nCauses and symptoms\nCysts of Cryptosporidia mature in the intestine and\nbile ducts within three to five days of ingestion. As noted,large-scale infections from contaminated water supplieshas been documented. However, human to human trans-mission (such as occurs in day care centers or throughsexual behavior) is also an important cause.\nMany individuals can be infected without any ill-\nness, but the major symptom is diarrhea , which is often\nwatery and incapacitating. Dehydration , low-grade\nfever , nausea, and abdominal cramps are frequent.\nIn those with a normal immune system, the disease\nusually lasts about 10 days. For patients with altered immu-nity (immunocompromised), the story is quite different,with diarrhea becoming chronic, debilitating, and even fatal.\nComplications\nDehydration and malnutrition are the most com-\nmon effects of infection. In about 20% of AIDS patients,bile duct infection also occurs and causes symptoms sim-ilar to gallbladder attacks. Eighty percent or more ofthose with infection of the bile ducts die from the dis-ease. The lungs and pancreas are also sometimesinvolved. Cryptosporidia are just one cause of the diar-\nrhea wasting syndrome in AIDS, which results in severeweight loss and malnutrition.\nDiagnosis\nThis is based on either finding the characteristic\ncysts in stool specimens, or on biopsy of an infectedorgan, such as the intestine.\nTreatment\nThe first aim of treatment is to avoid dehydration.\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluidsmay be needed. Medications used to treat diarrhea bydecreasing intestinal motility (Anti-Motility Agents),such as loperamide or diphenoxylate, are also useful, butshould only be used with the advice of a physician.\nTreatment aimed directly at Cryptosporidia is only\npartially effective, and rarely eliminates the organism.The medication most commonly used is paromomycin(Humatin), but others are presently under evaluation.\nPrognosis\nCryptosporidia rarely cause a serious disease in per-\nsons with normal immune systems. Replacement of fluidsis all that is usually needed. On the other hand, those withaltered immune systems often suffer for months to years.Paramomycin and other drugs have been able to improvesymptoms in over half of those treated. Unfortunately,many organisms are resistant, and recurrence is frequent.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent cryptosporidiosis is to mini-\nmize exposure to cysts from infected humans and ani-mals. Proper hand washing technique, especially in daycare centers, is recommended.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDavis, Charles E. “Laboratory Diagnosis of Parasitic Infec-\ntion.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine ,e d .\nAnthony S.

    "content": "CT-guided biopsy\nDefinition\nComputed tomography (CT) is a process that images\nanatomic information from a cross-sectional plane of thebody. Biopsy is the process of taking a sample of tissuefrom the body for analysis. CT is commonly used inbiopsies to provide images that help guide the tools orequipment necessary to perform the biopsy to the appro-priate area of the body.\nPurpose\nCT is used in the process of performing a biopsy,\nsuch as a needle biopsy, in order to guide the needle tothe site of the biopsy and to provide rapid and preciselocalization of the needle. CT enables imaging of areasthat are normally beyond visible boundaries. Thisenables the physician to see the target area clearly andhelp to ensure that the tissue being removed is from thetarget lesion.\nPrecautions\nThe patient that suffers from claustrophobia will\nwant to discuss this with their physician. This procedure\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 968CT-guided biopsyGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 968involves the patient being placed into the CT scanner, typ-\nically a small, enclosed area. Depending on the specifictype of biopsies being performed, certain anesthetics willbe used, so discuss drug allergies with your physician.\nDescription\nCT can assist in providing more enhanced images of\na suspicious lesion. It helps to determine whether atumor is truly solitary or not. CT can characterize thetumor and aid in the estimation of malignancy.\nPreparation\nSince there are many different types of biopsies, you\nshould follow the instructions from your physician toprepare for your CT-guided biopsy. Patients who sufferfrom claustrophobia should discuss their concerns withthe physician. In some cases, medicine can be given thatwill relax the patient during the procedure.\nRisks\nCT-guided biopsy does not increase the risk of the\nbiopsy any more than any other radiologic imaging suchas x ray.\nNormal results\nBecause the area being biopsied, as well as the spe-\ncific type of biopsy procedure can vary, results will vary.Before undergoing the procedure, notification procedureshould be clearly defined.\nResources\nBOOKS\nStedman’s Medical Dictionary. 27th ed.

The test can beadministered to anyone, from any nation, speaking anylanguage. A culture-fair test may help identify learningor emotional problems. The duration of the test varies forthe individual types of tests available, but the time isapproximately between 12–18 minutes per section (a testusually has two to four sections).\nA culture-fair test is often administered by employ-\ners in order to determine the best location for newemployees in a large company.

The disorder, which leads to a vari-ety of symptoms and physical abnormalities, is mostcommonly caused by taking medications containing thehormone over a long period of time. A more rare form ofthe disorder occurs when the body itself produces anexcessive amount of cortisol.\nDescription\nThe adrenals are two glands, each of which is perched\non the upper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of thegland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known as themedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is respon-sible for producing different types of hormones. Regulationof hormone production and release from the adrenal cortexinvolves the pituitary gland, a small gland located at thebase of the brain. After the hypothalamus (the part of thebrain containing secretions important to metabolic activi-ties) sends “releasing hormones” to the pituitary gland, thepituitary secretes a hormone called adrenocorticotropichormone (ACTH). The ACTH then travels through thebloodstream to the adrenal cortex, where it encourages theproduction and release of cortisol (sometimes called the“stress” hormone) and other adrenocortical hormones.\nCortisol, a very potent glucocorticoid—a group of\nadrenocortical hormones that protects the body fromstress and affect protein and carbohydrate metabolism—\nis involved in regulating the functioning of nearly everytype of organ and tissue in the body, and is considered tobe one of the few hormones absolutely necessary for life.Cortisol is involved in:\n• complex processing and utilization of many nutrients,\nincluding sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins\n• normal functioning of the circulatory system and the\nheart\n• functioning of muscles• normal kidney function• production of blood cells\n• normal processes involved in maintaining the skeletal\nsystem\n• proper functioning of the brain and nerves• normal responses of the immune system\nCushing’s syndrome, also called hypercortisolism,\nhas an adverse effect on all of the processes described\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 970Cushing’s syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 970above. The syndrome occurs in approximately 10 to 15\nout of every one million people per year, usually strikingadults between the ages of 20 and 50.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is\nthe long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones in medica-tions. Medications such as prednisone are used in a num-ber of inflammatory conditions. Such conditions includerheumatoid arthritis ,asthma ,vasculitis , lupus, and a\nvariety of other autoimmune disorders in which the\nbody’s immune cells accidentally attack some part of thebody itself. In these disorders, the glucocorticoids areused to dampen the immune response, thereby decreas-ing damage to the body.\nCushing’s syndrome can also be caused by three dif-\nferent categories of disease:\n• a pituitary tumor producing abnormally large quantities\nof ACTH\n• the abnormal production of ACTH by some source\nother than the pituitary\n• a tumor within the adrenal gland overproducing cortisol\nAlthough it is rare, about two-thirds of endoge-\nnous (occurring within the body rather than from asource outside the body, like a medication) Cushing’ssyndrome is a result of Cushing’s disease. The term“Cushing’s disease” refers to Cushing’s syndrome,which is caused by excessive secretion of ACTH by apituitary tumor, usually an adenoma (noncanceroustumor). The pituitary tumor causes increased growth ofthe adrenal cortex (hyperplasia) and increased cortisolproduction. Cushing’s disease affects women moreoften than men.\nTumors in locations other than the pituitary can also\nproduce ACTH. This is called ectopic ACTH syndrome(“ectopic” refers to something existing out of its normalplace). Tumors in the lung account for more than half ofall cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome. Other types oftumors that may produce ACTH include tumors of thethymus, the pancreas, the thyroid, and the adrenal gland.Nearly all adrenal gland tumors are benign (noncancer-ous), although in rare instances a tumor may actually becancerous.\nSymptoms of cortisol excess (resulting from med-\nication or from the body’s excess production of the hor-mone) include:\n• weight gain\n• an abnormal accumulation of fatty pads in the face (cre-\nating the distinctive “moon face” of Cushing’s syn-drome); in the trunk (termed “truncal obesity”); andover the upper back and the back of the neck (giving the\nindividual what has been called a “buffalo hump”)\n• purple and pink stretch marks across the abdomen and\nflanks\n• high blood pressure\n• weak, thinning bones (osteoporosis)\n• weak muscles\n• low energy\n• thin, fragile skin, with a tendency toward both bruising\nand slow healing\n• abnormalities in the processing of sugars (glucose),\nwith occasional development of actual diabetes\n• kidney stones\n• increased risk of infections\n• emotional disturbances, including mood swings, depres-\nsion, irritability, confusion, or even a complete breakwith reality (psychosis)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 971Cushing’s syndrome\nWoman with Cushing’s syndrome.

Fol-\nlowing a review of the patient’s medical history, physical\nexamination , and routine blood tests, a series of more\nsophisticated tests is available to achieve a diagnosis.\n24-hour free cortisol test\nThis is the most specific diagnostic test for identify-\ning Cushing’s syndrome. It involves measuring theamount of cortisol present in the urine over a 24-hourperiod. When excess cortisol is present in the blood-stream, it is processed by the kidneys and removed aswaste in the urine. This 24-hour free cortisol test requiresthat an individual collect exactly 24-hours’ worth ofurine in a single container. The urine is then analyzed ina laboratory to determine the quantity of cortisol present.This technique can also be paired with the administrationof dexamethasone, which in a normal individual wouldcause urine cortisol to be very low. Once a diagnosis hasbeen made using the 24-hour free cortisol test, other testsare used to find the exact location of the abnormalitycausing excess cortisol production.\nDexamethasone suppression test\nThis test is useful in distinguishing individuals with\nexcess ACTH production due to a pituitary adenomafrom those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors.Patients are given dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocor-ticoid) orally every six hours for four days. Low doses ofdexamethasone are given during the first two days; forthe last two days, higher doses are administered. Beforedexamethasone is administered, as well as on each day ofthe test, 24-hour urine collections are obtained.\nBecause cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the\npituitary to decrease ACTH, the normal response aftertaking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine corti-sol levels. Thus, the cortisol response to dexamethasonediffers depending on whether the cause of Cushing’s syn-drome is a pituitary adenoma or an ectopic ACTH-pro-ducing tumor.\nHowever, the dexamethasone suppression test may\nproduce false-positive results in patients with conditionssuch as depression, alcohol abuse, high estrogen levels,acute illness, and stress. On the other hand, drugs such asphenytoin and phenobarbital may produce false-negativeresults. Thus, patients are usually advised to stop takingthese drugs at least one week prior to the test.\nCorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)\nstimulation test\nThe CRH stimulation test is given to help distin-\nguish between patients with pituitary adenomas and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 972Cushing’s syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 972those with either ectopic ACTH syndrome or cortisol-\nsecreting adrenal tumors. In this test, patients are givenan injection of CRH, the corticotropin-releasing hor-mone that causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. Inpatients with pituitary adenomas, blood levels of ACTHand cortisol usually rise. However, in patients withectopic ACTH syndrome, this rise is rarely seen. Inpatients with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors, this risealmost never occurs.\nPetrosal sinus sampling\nAlthough this test is not always necessary, it may be\nused to distinguish between a pituitary adenoma and anectopic source of ACTH. Petrosal sinus sampling involvesdrawing blood directly from veins that drain the pituitary.This test, which is usually performed with local anesthe-sia and mild sedation , requires inserting tiny, flexible\ntubes (catheters) through a vein in the upper thigh orgroin area. The catheters are then threaded up slowly untilthey reach veins in an area of the skull known as the pet-rosal sinuses. X rays are typically used to confirm the cor-rect position of the catheters. Often CRH is also givenduring the test to increase the accuracy of results.\nWhen blood tested from the petrosal sinuses reveals\na higher ACTH level than blood drawn from a vein in theforearm, the likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma.When the two samples show similar levels of ACTH, thediagnosis indicates ectopic ACTH syndrome.\nRadiologic imaging tests\nImaging tests such as computed tomography scans\n(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are only\nused to look at the pituitary and adrenal glands after afirm diagnosis has already been made. The presence of apituitary or adrenal tumor does not necessarily guaranteethat it is the source of increased ACTH production. Manyhealthy people with no symptoms or disease whatsoeverhave noncancerous tumors in the pituitary and adrenalglands. Thus, CT and MRI is often used to image thepituitary and adrenal glands in preparation for surgery.\nTreatment\nThe choice of a specific treatment depends on the\ntype of problem causing the cortisol excess. Pituitary andadrenal adenomas are usually removed surgically. Malig-nant adrenal tumors always require surgical removal.\nTreatment of ectopic ACTH syndrome also involves\nremoving all of the cancerous cells that are producingACTH. This may be done through surgery, chemothera-\npy(using combinations of cancer-killing drugs), or radi-\nation therapy (using x rays to kill cancer cells), depend-ing on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Radi-\nation therapy may also be used on the pituitary (with orwithout surgery) for patients who cannot undergosurgery, or for patients whose surgery did not successful-ly decrease pituitary release of ACTH.\nThere are a number of drugs that are effective in\ndecreasing adrenal production of cortisol. These medica-tions include mitotane, ketoconazole, metyrapone,trilostane, aminoglutethimide, and mifepristone . These\ndrugs are sometimes given prior to surgery in an effort toreverse the problems brought on by cortisol excess. How-ever, the drugs may also need to be administered aftersurgery (sometimes along with radiation treatments) inpatients who continue to have excess pituitary productionof ACTH.\nBecause pituitary surgery can cause ACTH levels to\ndrop too low, some patients require short-term treatmentwith a cortisol-like medication after surgery. Patientswho need adrenal surgery may also require glucocorti-coid replacement. If the entire adrenal gland has beenremoved, the patient must take oral glucocorticoids forthe rest of his or her life.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis depends on the source of the problem.\nWhen pituitary adenomas are identified as the source ofincreased ACTH leading to cortisol excess, about 80% ofpatients are cured by surgery. When cortisol excess isdue to some other form of cancer, the prognosis dependson the type of cancer and the extent of its spread.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrickner, Colleen. Inside Out: An Autobiography.

    "title": "Cutaneous larva migrans",
    "content": "Cutaneous larva migrans\nDefinition\nCutaneous larvae migrans is a parasitic skin disease\ncaused by a hookworm larvae that usually infests dogs,cats, and other animals. Humans can pick up the infec-tion by walking barefoot on soil or beaches contaminatedwith animal feces.\nDescription\nCutaneous larvae migrans (also called “creeping\neruption” or “ground itch”) is found in southeastern andGulf states, and in tropical developing countries.\nThe hookworms that cause the condition are small,\nround blood-sucking worms that infest about 700 millionpeople around the world. Cutaneous larvae migransoccurs most often among children, those who crawlbeneath raised buildings, and sunbathers who lie downon wet sand contaminated with hookworm larvae.\nCauses and symptoms\nAfter an animal passes feces that are infested with\nhookworm eggs, the eggs hatch into infective larvae thatare able to penetrate human skin (even through solidmaterial, such as a beach towel). The larvae are common-ly found in shaded, moist, or sandy areas (such as beach-es, a child’s sandbox, or areas underneath a house),where they are easily picked up by bare feet or buttocks.\nIn minor infestations, there may be no symptoms at\nall. In more severe cases, a red elevation of the skin(papule) appears within a few hours after the larvae havepenetrated the skin. This usually arises first in areas thatare in contact with the soil, such as the feet, hands, andbuttocks.\nBetween a few days and a few months after infec-\ntion, the larvae begin to migrate beneath the skin, leavingextremely itchy red lines that may be accompanied byblisters. These red lines usually appear at the top of thesole of the foot or on the buttocks.\nTyically, the larvae travel through the bloodstream, to\nthe lungs, and then migrate into the mouth where they areswallowed and attach to the small intestine lining. Therethey mature into adult worms. In cases where the larvaemigrate through the lungs, they can produce anemia,cough , and pneumonia , in addition to the itchy rash.\nDiagnosis\nThe condition can be diagnosed by microscopic\ninspection of feces which can reveal hookworm eggs. Inaddition visual inspection of the skin would reveal tell-tale itchy red lines and blisters.\nTreatment\nPeople without intestinal symptoms do not need\ntreatment, since the worms will eventually die or be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 974Cutaneous larva migransGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 974excreted. Thiabendazole or albendazole are used to treat\nthe infestation. Mild infections can be treated by apply-ing one of the drugs to the skin along the tracks and thenormal skin surrounding the area. Thiabendazole alsocan be given internally, but taken this way it can causeside effects including dizziness , nausea, and vomiting\nPrognosis\nNo matter how severe an infestation, with adequate\ntreatment patients recover completely. However, if thepatient scratches the lesions open, the areas can becomevulnerable to bacterial infection.\nPrevention\nIn the United States, the prevalence of dogs and cats\nwith hookworms is the reason why the infective larvaeare found so commonly in soil and sand. The play habitsof children, together with their attraction to pets, putsthem at high risk for hookworm infection and cutaneouslarvae migrans.\nHuman hookworm infestation can be prevented by\npracticing good personal hygiene, deworming pets, andnot allowing children to play in potentially contaminatedenvironments.\nResources\nBOOKS\nTurkington, Carol A., and Jeffrey S.

This disease involvesthe uncontrollable proliferation of T-lymphocytes knownas T-helper cells, so named because of their role in theimmune response. T-helper cells are characterized by thepresence of a protein receptor on its surface called CD4.Accordingly, T-helper cells are said to be CD4+.\nThe proliferation of T-helper cells results in the pen-\netration, or infiltration, of these abnormal cells into theepidermal layer of the skin. The skin reacts with slightlyscaling lesions that itch, although the sites of greatestinfiltration do not necessarily correspond to the sites ofthe lesions. The lesions are most often located on thetrunk, but can be present on any part of the body. In themost common course of the disease, the patchy lesionsprogress to palpable plaques that are deeper red and havemore defined edges. As the disease worsens, skin tumorsdevelop that are often mushroom-shaped, hence thename mycosis fungoides. Finally, the cancer progressesto extracutanous involvement, often in the lymph nodesor the viscera.\nCTCL is a rare disease, with an annual incidence of\nabout 0.29 cases per 100,000 persons in the UnitedStates. It is about half as common in Eastern Europe.However, this discrepancy may be attributed to a differ-ing physician awareness of the disease rather than a truedifference in occurrence. In the Unites States, there areabout 500 to 600 new cases a year and about 100 to 200deaths. Usually seen in older adults, the median age atdiagnosis is 55 to 60 years, and it strikes twice as manymen as women.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of CTCL is unknown. Exposure to chemi-\ncals or pesticides has been suggested but the most recentstudy on the subject failed to show a connection betweenexposure and development of the disease. The ability toisolate various viruses from cell lines grown from cells ofCTCL patients raises the question of a viral cause, butstudies have been unable to confirm these suspicions.\nThe symptoms of CTCL are seen primarily in the\nskin, with itchy red patches or plaques and, usually overtime, mushroom-shaped skin tumors. Any part of theskin can be involved and the extent and distribution ofthe rash or tumors vary greatly from patient to patient.The only really universal symptom of the disease is theitch and this symptom is usually what brings the patientto the doctor for treatment. If the disease spreads outsideof the skin, the symptoms include swelling of the lymph\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 975Cutaneous T-cell lymphomaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 975nodes, usually most severe in those draining the areas\nwith skin involvement. Spread to the viscera is mostoften manifested as disorders of the lungs, upper diges-tive tract, central nervous system, or liver but virtuallyany organ can be shown to be involved at autopsy .\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of CTCL is often difficult in the early\nstages because of its slow progression and ability tomimic many other benign skin conditions. The earlypatches of CTCL resemble eczema, psoriasis , and con-\ntact dermatitis . In a further complication, the early man-\nifestations of the disease can respond favorably to thetopical corticosteroid treatments prescribed for these skindisorders. This has the unfortunate result of the diseasebeing missed and the patient remaining untreated foryears. CTCL is most likely discovered when a physicianmaintains a suspicion about the disease, performs multi-ple skin biopsies, and provides close follow-up after theinitial presentation.\nSkin biopsies showing penetration of abnormal cells\ninto the epidermal tissue are necessary to make a firmdiagnosis of CTCL. Several molecular studies can alsohelp support the diagnosis. The first looks at the cellularproteins seen on the surface of the abnormal cells. Manycases of CTCL show the retention of the CD4+ protein,but the loss of other proteins usually seen on the surfaceof mature CD4+ cells, such as Leu-8 or Leu-9. Theabnormal cells also show unusual rearrangements at thegenetic level for the gene that encodes the T-cell recep-tors. These rearrangements can be identified usingSouthern blot analysis. The information from the molec-ular tests, combined with the presence of abnormal cellsin the epidermis, strongly supports the CTCL diagnosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment of CTCL depends on the stage of the dis-\nease. The current staging of this disease was first presentedat the International Consensus Conference on CTCL in1997. The staging attempts to show the complex interac-tion between the various outward symptoms of the diseaseand prognosis. The system has seven clinical stages basedon skin involvement (tumor = T), lymph node involvement(LN), and presence of visceral metastases (M).\nThe first stage, IA, is characterized by plaques cov-\nering less than 10% of the body (T1) and no visceralinvolvement (M0). Lymph node condition at this stagecan be uninvolved, reactive to the skin disease, or der-matopathic (biopsies showing CTCL involvement) butnot enlarged (LN0-2). The shorthand expression of thisstage is therefore T1, LN0-2, M0. The next stage, IB, dif-fers from IA in that greater than 10% of the body is cov-\nered by plaques (T2, LN0-2, M0). Stage IIA occurs withany amount of plaques in addition to the ability to pal-pate the lymph node and the lymph uninvolved, reactive,or dermatopathic (T1-2, LN0-2, M0).\nTreatments applied to the skin are preferred for\npatients having these preliminary stages of the disease,commonly topical chemotherapy with mechlorethamine\nhydrochloride (nitrogen mustard) or phototherapy of\npsoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUV A). Topical chemothera-py involves application to the skin of nitrogen mustard,an alkylating agent, in a concentration of 10–20 mg/dLin an aqueous or ointment base. Treatment of affectedskin is suggested at a minimum and application over theentire skin surface is often recommended. Care needs tobe taken that coverage of involved skin is adequate, aspatients who self-apply the drug often cannot reach allaffected areas. The most common side effect is skinhypersensitivity to the drug. Nearly all patients respondfavorably to this treatment, with a 32–61% completeresponse rate, based on amount of skin involvement.Unfortunately, only 10–15% of patients maintain a com-plete response rate after discontinuing the treatment.\nPhototherapy involves treatment with an orally\nadministered drug, 8-methyloxypsoralen, that renders theskin sensitive to long-wave ultraviolet light (UV A), fol-lowed by controlled exposure to the radiation. During theinitial treatment period, which may last as long as sixmonths, patients are treated two to three times weekly.This is reduced to about once monthly after initial clear-ing of the lesions. Redness of the skin and blistering arethe most common side effects of the treatment and aremuch more common in patients presenting with overallskin redness, or erythroderma, so lower intensities oflight are usually used in this case. About 50% of allpatients experience complete clearance with this treat-ment. Some patients with very fair skin and limited skininvolvement can successfully treat themselves at homewith special lamps and no psoralen.\nThe next stage, IIB, involves one or more cutaneous\ntumors, in combination with absent or present palpablelymph nodes, lymph uninvolved, reactive, or dermatopath-ic, and no visceral involvement (T3, LN0-2, M0). Stage IIIis characterized by erythroderma, an abnormal rednessover widespread areas of the skin (T4, LN0-2, M0).\nFor more extensive disease, radiation therapy is an\neffective treatment option. It is generally used after thetopical treatments have proven ineffective. Individualplaques or tumors can be treated using electrons, ortho-voltage x rays, or megavoltage photons with exposure inthe range of 15 to 25 Gy. Photon therapy has proven par-ticularly useful once the lymph nodes are involved. Anoth-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 976Cutaneous T-cell lymphomaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 976er possibility is total-skin electron beam therapy (TSEB),\nalthough the availability of this treatment method is limit-ed. It involves irradiation of the entire body with energizedelectrons. Side effects of this treatment include loss of fin-ger and toe nails, acute redness of the skin, and inability tosweat for about six to 12 months after therapy. Almost allpatients respond favorably to radiation treatment and anyreoccurrence is usually much less severe.\nCombinations of different types of treatments is a very\ncommon approach to the management of CTCL. Topicalnitrogen mustard or PUV A is often used after completionof radiation treatment to prolong the effects. The additionof genetically engineered interferon to PUV A therapy sig-nificantly increases the percentage of patients showing acomplete response. Furthermore, although treatments usingchemotherapy drugs alone, such as deoxycofomycin oretretinate, have been disappointing for CTCL, combiningthese drugs with interferon has shown promising results.Interferon has also been combined with retinoid treatments,although the mechanism of action of retinoids (Vitamin Aanalogues) against CTCL is unknown.\nThe final two stages of the disease are IV A and IVB.\nIV A presents as any amount of skin involvement, absentor present palpable lymph nodes, no visceral involve-ment, and lymph that contains large clusters of convolut-ed cells or obliterated nodes (T1-4, LN3-4). IVB differsin the addition of palpable lymph nodes and visceralinvolvement (T1-4, LN3-4, M1). All of the treatmentmethods described above are appropriate for the finaltwo stages of the disease.\nAlternative treatment\nItching of the skin is one of the most troublesome\nsymptoms of CTCL. One alternative treatment for itchi-ness is the application of a brewed solution of chickweedthat is applied to the skin using cloth compresses. Anoth-er suggested topical application is a mixture of vitaminE, vitamin A, unflavored yogurt, honey, and zinc oxide.Evening primrose oil applied topically is also claimed toreduce itch and promote healing.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for CTCL is dependent on the stage of\nthe disease. Prognosis is very good if the disease has onlyprogressed to Stage IA, with a mean survival of 20 ormore years. At this point, the disease is a very low mortali-ty risk to the patient, with most deaths occurring to per-sons in this group unrelated to CTCL. For patients diag-nosed at stages IB and IIA, the median survival is about 12years. The disease in both of these stages involves inter-mediate risk to the patient.

Loose skin, theprimary and most obvious symptom of these diseases, iscaused by underlying defects in connective tissue struc-ture, which also cause more serious internal problems invocal cords, bones, cartilage, blood vessels, bladder, kid-ney, digestive system, and lungs. The loose skin is partic-ularly obvious on the face, and children with the disorderlook sad or mournful.\nThere are four genetic forms of the disease: sex-\nlinked, autosomal dominant, and two types of autosomalrecessive inheritance. The recessive forms are the mostcommon and are usually more severe than the other forms.\nCauses and Symptoms\nSex-linked cutis laxa is caused by a defective gene on\nthe X chromosome. In addition to loose skin, its symp-toms are mild mental retardation , loose joints, bone\nabnormalities (like hooked nose, pigeon breast, and fun-nel breast), frequent loose stools, urinary tract blockages,and deficiencies in lysyl oxidase, an enzyme required forthe formation of properly functioning connective tissue.(But the defective gene does not code for lysyl oxidase.)\nAutosomal dominant cutis laxa is caused by a defec-\ntive gene carried on an autosomal (not sex-linked) chro-mosome. Its symptoms are loose, hanging skin, missingelastic fibers, premature aging , and pulmonary emphy-\nsema . Only a few families are known with cutis laxa\ninherited as a dominant trait.\nAutosomal recessive cutis laxa type 1 is caused by a\ndefective gene on chromosome 5. Symptoms includeemphysema; diverticula in the esophagus, duodenum,and bladder; lax and dislocated joints; tortuous arteries;hernias; lysyl oxidase deficiencies; and retarded growth.\nAutosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2 is also inherit-\ned as a recessive trait. In addition to the loose skin, thisform of the disease is characterized by bone abnormali-ties, the delayed joining of the cranial (skull) bones, hipdislocation, curvature of the spine, flat feet, and exces-sive tooth decay .\nAcquired cutis laxa tends to follow (and may be\ncaused by) severe illness characterized by fever , inflam-\nmation, and a severe skin rash ( erythema multiforme );\nan injury to the nerves that control blood vessel dilationand contraction; or an autoimmune condition.\nDiagnosis\nThe signs of cutis laxa are very obvious, and it is\nusually easy to diagnose by examining the skin. Thedetermination of which form of cutis laxa is present isaided by information about the associated symptoms andby family histories.\nTreatment\nThere is no effective cure for any of these disorders.\nComplications are treated by appropriate specialists, forexample, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatolo-gists, and dermatologists. Plastic surgery can be helpful forcosmetic purposes, but the skin may become loose again.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for cutis laxa varies with the form of\nthe disorder. The effects may be relatively mild with indi-viduals living a fairly normal, full life, or the disease maybe fatal.\nPrevention\nThe inherited forms of cutis laxa are genetically\ndetermined and are not currently preventable. Genetic\ncounseling can be helpful for anyone with a family his-\ntory of cutis laxa. The cause of acquired cutis laxa is notknown, so no preventive measures can be taken.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPope, F.

This disorder wasidentified a century ago, but its cause is still unknown.Episodes can be triggered by emotional stress or infec-\ntions, can last hours or days, and can return at any time.Abdominal pain is a frequent feature.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of CVS is still a mystery. Similarities to\nmigraine suggest a common cause, but as yet no firm evi-dence has surfaced. Patients can usually identify somefactor that precedes an attack. V omiting can be protractedand lead to complications such as dehydration , chemi-\ncal imbalances, tearing and burning, and bleeding of theesophagus (swallowing tube). Between attacks, there isno sign of any illness.\nDiagnosis\nThe most important and difficult aspect of CVS is to\nbe sure there is not an acute and life-threatening event inprogress. So many diseases can cause vomiting—frombowel obstruction to epilepsy—that an accurate and time-ly diagnosis is critical. Because there is no way to provethe diagnosis of CVS, the physician must instead disproveevery other diagnosis. This can be tedious, expensive,exhausting, and involve almost every system in the body.The first episode may be diagnosed as a stomach flu whennothing more serious turns up. Only after several episodesand several fruitless searches for a cause will a physiciannormally consider the diagnosis of CVS.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 980Cyclic vomiting syndromeGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 980Treatment\nSeveral different medications have given good\nresults in small trials.

    "content": "Cyclosporiasis\nDefinition\nCyclosporiasis refers to infection by the spore-form-\ning protozoan known as Cyclospora . Protozoa are a\ngroup of parasites that infect the human intestine. Para-sites are organisms that live in another body, called thehost, and get food and liquids from that host. This para-site is a member of the group of protozoa known as coc-cidia, to which Cryptosporidia also belongs. This group\nof parasites infects the human intestine, and causeschronic recurrent infections in those with altered immu-nity or AIDS . Even in people with normal immune func-\ntion, Cyclopsora can cause prolonged bouts of diarrhea\nand other gastrointestinal symptoms.\nDescription\nUntil recently, Cyclospora was considered to be a\nform of algae. The parasite causes a common form ofwaterborne infectious diarrhea throughout the world. Justhow the parasite gets into water sources is not yet clear. Itis known that ingestion of small cysts in contaminatedwater leads to disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nSymptoms begin after an incubation period of about a\nday or so following ingestion of cysts. A brief period of flu-like illness characterized by weakness and low-grade fever\nis followed by watery diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, andmuscle aches. In some patients, symptoms may wax andwane for weeks, and there are those in whom nausea andburping may predominate. It is also believed that infectioncan occur without any symptoms at all.\nIn patients with abnormal immunity (immunocom-\npromised patients), such as those with AIDS and cancer ,\nprolonged diarrhea and severe weight loss often becomea major problem. The bile ducts are also susceptible toinfection in AIDS patients.\nDiagnosis\nThe disease should be suspected in anyone with a\nhistory of prolonged or recurrent diarrhea. The parasite isidentified either by staining stool specimens or by apply-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 981CyclosporiasisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 981ing certain fluorescent ultraviolet techniques to find the\ncharacteristic cysts. Biopsy of an infected organ such asthe intestine through an endoscope is another way tomake the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nThe first aim of treatment as with any severe diar-\nrheal illness is to avoid dehydration and malnutrition .\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluidsare sometimes needed. Medications used to treat diarrheaby decreasing intestinal motility, such as loperamide ordiphenoxylate are also useful, but should only be usedwith the advice of a physician.KEY TERMS\nAnti-motility medications —Medications such as\nloperamide (sold as Imodium), dephenoxylate(sold as Lomotil), or medications containingcodeine or narcotics that decrease the ability ofthe intestine to contract. This can worsen the con-dition of a patient with dysentery or colitis.\nCyst—A protective sac that includes either fluid or\nthe cell of an organism. The cyst enables manyorganisms to survive in the environment for longperiods of time without need for food or water.\nImmunocompromised —A change or alteration of\nthe immune system that normally serves to fightoff infections other illnesses. This can involvechanges in antibodies that the body produces(hygogammaglobulinemia), or a defect in the cellsthat partake in the immune response. Diseasessuch as AIDS and cancer exhibit changes in thebody’s natural immunity.\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) —A liquid\npreparation developed by the World Health Orga-nization that can decrease fluid loss in personswith diarrhea. Originally developed to be pre-pared with materials available in the home, com-mercial preparations have recently come into use.\nParasite —An organism that lives on or in another\nand takes nourishment (food and fluids) from thatorganism.\nProtozoa —Group of extremely small single cell\n(unicellular) or acellular organisms that are foundin moist soil or water. They tend to exist as para-sites, living off other life forms.\nSpore —A resistant form of certain species of bac-\nteria, protozoa, and other organisms.The use of the medication, trimethoprim-sulfameth-\noxazole (Bactrim) for one week can be successful intreating intestinal infections and prevents relapse in thosewith a normal immune system. The same medicine canbe prescribed to treat infections of both the intestine orbile ducts in immunocompromised individuals, but main-tenance or continuous treatment is often needed.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook is quite good for individuals in whom a\ndiagnosis is made. Even without treatment, symptomsusually do not last much more than a month or so exceptin cases with altered immunity. Fortunately, treatment isusually successful even in those patients.\nPrevention\nAside from a waterborne source as the origin of\ninfection, little else is known about how the parasite istransmitted. Therefore, little can be done regarding pre-vention, except to maintain proper hand washing tech-niques and hygiene.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDavis, Charles E. “Laboratory Diagnosis of Parasitic Infec-\ntion.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine ,e d .\nAnthony S.

Radiation and chemotherapy are also used to treat\nbladder cancer . Surgery is used to remove cancer when\nit is in the muscle of the bladder.\nPrecautions\nCystectomy is an aggressive treatment that may not\nbe appropriate for patients with superficial tumors thatrespond to more conservative treatment.\nDescription\nCystectomy is a major surgical operation. The\npatient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision ismade across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located,tied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad-der. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. Thebladder and associated organs are removed. In men, theprostate is removed with the bladder. In women, theuterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina areremoved with the bladder. The bladder collects urinefrom the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since thebladder is removed, a new method must be created toremove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine isremoved, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. Theother end is used to form a stoma, an opening through theabdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con-nected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys nowflows down the ureters, into the tube, and through thestoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine.\nPreparation\nThe medical team will discuss the procedure and tell\nthe patient where the stoma will appear and what it willlook like. The patient receives instruction on caring for astoma and bag. Counseling may be initiated.

The bagis generally worn around the waist under the clothing. Ittakes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing thebag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it isproduced, essentially continuously. The stoma must betreated properly to ensure that it does not become infect-ed or blocked.

    "title": "Cystic fibrosis",
    "content": "Cystic fibrosis\nDefinition\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that\naffects the lungs, digestive system, sweat glands, andmale fertility. Its name derives from the fibrous scar tis-sue that develops in the pancreas, one of the principalorgans affected by the disease.\nDescription\nCystic fibrosis affects the body’s ability to move salt\nand water in and out of cells. This defect causes the lungsand pancreas to secrete thick mucus, blocking passage-ways and preventing proper function.\nCF affects approximately 30,000 children and young\nadults in the United States, and about 3,000 babies areborn with CF every year. CF primarily affects people ofwhite northern-European descent; rates are much lowerin non-white populations.\nMany of the symptoms of CF can be treated with\ndrugs or nutritional supplements. Close attention to andprompt treatment of respiratory and digestive complica-tions have dramatically increased the expected life spanof a person with CF. While several decades ago mostchildren with CF died by age two, today about half of allpeople with CF live past age 31. That median age isexpected to grow as new treatments are developed, and itis estimated that a person born in 1998 with CF has amedian expected life span of 40 years.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease, meaning it is\ncaused by a defect in the person’s genes. Genes, found inthe nucleus of all the body’s cells, control cell functionby serving as the blueprint for the production of proteins.Proteins carry out a wide variety of functions withincells. The gene that, when defective, causes CF, is calledthe CFTR gene, which stands for cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator. A simple defect in thisgene leads to all the consequences of CF. There are over500 known defects in the CFTR gene that can cause CF.However, 70% of all people with a defective CFTR genehave the same defect, known as delta-F508.\nMuch as sentences are composed of long strings of\nwords, each made of letters; genes can be thought of aslong strings of chemical words, each made of chemicalletters, called nucleotides. Just as a sentence can bechanged by rearranging its letters, genes can be mutated,or changed, by changes in the sequence of theirnucleotide letters. The gene defects in CF are calledpoint mutations, meaning that the gene is mutated only atone small spot along its length. In other words, the delta-F508 mutation is a loss of one “letter” out of thousandswithin the CFTR gene. As a result, the CFTR proteinmade from its blueprint is made incorrectly, and cannotperform its function properly.\nThe CFTR protein helps to produce mucus. Mucus is\na complex mixture of salts, water, sugars, and proteins thatcleanses, lubricates, and protects many passageways in thebody, including those in the lungs and pancreas. The roleof the CFTR protein is to allow chloride ions to exit themucus-producing cells. When the chloride ions leave thesecells, water follows, thinning the mucus. In this way, theCFTR protein helps to keep mucus from becoming thickand sluggish, thus allowing the mucus to be moved steadi-ly along the passageways to aid in cleansing.\nIn CF, the CFTR protein cannot allow chloride ions\nout of the mucus-producing cells. With less chlorideleaving, less water leaves, and the mucus becomes thickand sticky. It can no longer move freely through the pas-sageways, so they become clogged. In the pancreas,clogged passageways prevent secretion of digestiveenzymes into the intestine, causing serious impairmentof digestion—especially of fat—which may lead to mal-\nnutrition . Mucus in the lungs may plug the airways, pre-\nventing good air exchange and, ultimately, leading toemphysema . The mucus is also a rich source of nutrients\nfor bacteria, leading to frequent infections.\nINHERITANCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS. To understand\nthe inheritance pattern of CF, it is important to realize thatgenes actually have two functions. First, as noted above,they serve as the blueprint for the production of proteins.Second, they are the material of inheritance: parents passon characteristics to their children by combining thegenes in egg and sperm to make a new individual.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 984Cystic fibrosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 984Each person actually has two copies of each gene,\nincluding the CFTR gene, in each of their body cells. Dur-ing sperm and egg production, however, these two copiesseparate, so that each sperm or egg contains only one copyof each gene. When sperm and egg unite, the newly creat-ed cell once again has two copies of each gene.\nThe two gene copies may be the same or they may\nbe slightly different. For the CFTR gene, for instance, aperson may have two normal copies, or one normal andone mutated copy, or two mutated copies. A person withtwo mutated copies will develop cystic fibrosis. A personwith one mutated copy is said to be a carrier. A carrierwill not have symptoms of CF, but can pass on the mutat-ed CFTR gene to his/her children.\nWhen two carriers have children, they have a one in\nfour chance of having a child with CF each time theyconceive. They have a two in four chance of having achild who is a carrier, and a one in four chance of havinga child with two normal CFTR genes.\nApproximately one in every 25 Americans of north-\nern-European descent is a carrier of the mutated CFgene, while only one in 17,000 African Americans andone in 30,000 Asian Americans are carriers. Since carri-ers are symptom-free, very few people will knowwhether or not they are carriers unless there is a familyhistory of the disease. Two white Americans with nofamily history of CF have a one in 2,500 chance of hav-\ning a child with CF.\nIt may seem puzzling that a mutated gene with such\nharmful consequences would remain so common; onemight guess that the high mortality of CF would quicklylead to loss of the mutated gene from the population.Some researchers now believe the reason for the persis-tence of the CF gene is that carriers, those with only onecopy of the gene, are protected from the full effects ofcholera , a microorganism that infects the intestine, caus-\ning intense diarrhea and eventual death by dehydra-\ntion. It is believed that having one copy of the CF gene is\nenough to prevent the full effects of cholera infection,while not enough to cause the symptoms of CF. This so-called “heterozygote advantage” is seen in some othergenetic disorders, including sickle-cell anemia.\nSymptoms\nThe most severe effects of cystic fibrosis are seen in\ntwo body systems: the gastrointestinal (digestive) sys-tem, and the respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs.CF also affects the sweat glands and male fertility.Symptoms develop gradually, with gastrointestinalsymptoms often the first to appear.\nGASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM. Ten to fifteen percent\nof babies who inherit CF have meconium ileus at birth.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 985Cystic fibrosis\nDOROTHY ANDERSEN, MD (1901–1963)\nDorothy Andersen was born on May 15, 1901, in\nAsheville, North Carolina. She was the only child of HansPeter Andersen and the former Mary Louise Mason.Orphaned as a young adult, Andersen put herself throughSaint Johnsbury Academy and Mount Holyoke Collegebefore enrolling in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,from which she received her M.D. in 1926.\nAndersen turned instead to medical research as a\npathologist at Babies Hospital of the Columbia-Presbyter-ian Medical Center in New York City, where she stayed formore than 20 years, eventually becoming chief of patholo-gy in 1952. Andersen is probably best known for discoveryof cystic fibrosis in 1935. That discovery came about duringthe postmortem examination of a child who had supposed-ly died of celiac disease, a nutritional disorder. Shesearched for similar cases in the autopsy files and in med-ical literature, eventually realizing that she had found a dis-ease that had never been described and to which she gavethe name cystic fibrosis.\n(Library of Congress)GEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 985Meconium is the first dark stool that a baby passes after\nbirth; ileus is an obstruction of the digestive tract. Themeconium of a newborn with meconium ileus is thick-ened and sticky, due to the presence of thickened mucusfrom the intestinal glands. Meconium ileus causesabdominal swelling and vomiting, and often requiressurgery immediately after birth. Presence of meconiumileus is considered highly indicative of CF. Borderlinecases may be misdiagnosed, however, and attributedinstead to “milk allergy.”\nOther abdominal symptoms are caused by the inabil-\nity of the pancreas to supply digestive enzymes to theintestine. During normal digestion, as food passes fromthe stomach into the small intestine, it is mixed with pan-creatic secretions which help to break down the nutrientsfor absorption. While the intestines themselves also pro-vide some digestive enzymes, the pancreas is the majorsource of enzymes for the digestion of all types of foods,especially fats and proteins.\nIn CF, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic duct,\nwhich is eventually closed off completely by scar tissueformation, leading to a condition known as pancreaticinsufficiency. Without pancreatic enzymes, largeamounts of undigested food pass into the large intes-tine. Bacterial action on this rich food source can causegas and abdominal swelling. The large amount of fatremaining in the feces makes it bulky, oily, and foul-smelling.\nBecause nutrients are only poorly digested and\nabsorbed, the person with CF is often ravenously hungry,underweight, and shorter than expected for his age.When CF is not treated for a longer period, a child maydevelop symptoms of malnutrition, including anemia,bloating, and, paradoxically, appetite loss.\nDiabetes becomes increasingly likely as a person\nwith CF ages. Scarring of the pancreas slowly destroysthose pancreatic cells which produce insulin, producingtype I, or insulin-dependent diabetes.\nGall stones affect approximately 10% of adults with\nCF. Liver problems are less common, but can be caused bythe buildup of fat within the liver. Complications of liverenlargement may include internal hemorrhaging, abdomi-nal fluid ( ascites ), spleen enlargement, and liver failure.\nOther gastrointestinal symptoms can include a pro-\nlapsed rectum, in which part of the rectal lining protrudesthrough the anus; intestinal obstruction; and rarely,intussusception , in which part of the intestinal tube slips\nover an adjoining part, cutting off blood supply.\nSomewhat less than 10% of people with CF do not\nhave gastrointestinal symptoms. Most of these people donot have the delta-F508 mutation, but rather a differentone, which presumably allows at least some of their\nCFTR proteins to function normally in the pancreas.\nRESPIRATORY TRACT. The respiratory tract includes\nthe nose, the throat, the trachea (or windpipe), thebronchi (which branch off from the trachea within eachlung), the smaller bronchioles, and the blind sacs calledalveoli, in which gas exchange takes place between airand blood.\nSwelling of the sinuses within the nose is common\nin people with CF. This usually shows up on x-ray, andmay aid the diagnosis of CF. However, this swelling,called pansinusitis, rarely causes problems, and does notusually require treatment.\nNasal polyps , or growths, affect about one in five\npeople with CF. These growths are not cancerous, and donot require removal unless they become annoying. Whilenasal polyps appear in older people without CF, especiallythose with allergies , they are rare in children without CF.\nThe lungs are the site of the most life-threatening\neffects of CF. The production of a thick, sticky mucusincreases the likelihood of infection, decreases the abil-ity to protect against infection, causes inflammationand swelling, decreases the functional capacity of thelungs, and may lead to emphysema. People with CFwill live with chronic populations of bacteria in theirlungs, and lung infection is the major cause of death forthose with CF.\nThe bronchioles and bronchi normally produce a\nthin, clear mucus that traps foreign particles includingbacteria and viruses. Tiny hair-like projections on thesurface of these passageways slowly sweep the mucusalong, out of the lungs and up the trachea to the back ofthe throat, where it may be swallowed or coughed up.This “mucociliary escalator” is one of the principaldefenses against lung infection.\nThe thickened mucus of CF prevents easy movement\nout of the lungs, and increases the irritation and inflam-mation of lung tissue. This inflammation swells the pas-sageways, partially closing them down, further hamper-ing the movement of mucus. A person with CF is likelyto cough more frequently and more vigorously as the\nlungs attempt to clean themselves out.\nAt the same time, infection becomes more likely\nsince the mucus is a rich source of nutrients. Bronchitis ,\nbronchiolitis, and pneumonia are frequent in CF. The\nmost common infecting organisms are the bacteriaStaphylococcus aureus ,Haemophilus influenzae , and\nPseudomonas aeruginosa . A small percentage of people\nwith CF have infections caused by Burkholderia cepacia ,\na bacterium which is resistant to most current antibiotics\n(Burkholderia cepacia was formerly known as\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 986Cystic fibrosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 986Pseudomonas cepacia .) The fungus Aspergillus fumiga-\ntusmay infect older children and adults.\nThe body’s response to infection is to increase\nmucus production; white blood cells fighting the infec-tion thicken the mucus even further as they break downand release their cell contents. These white blood cellsalso provoke more inflammation, continuing the down-ward spiral that marks untreated CF.\nAs mucus accumulates, it can plug up the smaller\npassageways in the lungs, decreasing functional lungvolume. Getting enough air can become difficult; tired-ness, shortness of breath , and intolerance of exercise\nbecome more common. Because air passes obstructionsmore easily during inhalation than during exhalation,over time, air becomes trapped in the smallest chambersof the lungs, the alveoli. As millions of alveoli graduallyexpand, the chest takes on the enlarged, barrel-shapedappearance typical of emphysema.\nFor unknown reasons, recurrent respiratory infec-\ntions lead to “digital clubbing,” in which the last joint ofthe fingers and toes becomes slightly enlarged.\nSWEAT GLANDS. The CFTR protein helps to regulate\nthe amount of salt in sweat. People with CF have sweatthat is much saltier than normal, and measuring the salti-ness of a person’s sweat is the most important diagnostictest for CF. Parents may notice that their infants taste saltywhen they kiss them. Excess salt loss is not usually a prob-lem except during prolonged exercise or heat. While mostolder children and adults with CF compensate for thisextra salt loss by eating more salty foods, infants andyoung children are in danger of suffering its effects (suchas heat prostration), especially during summer. Heat pros-tration is marked by lethargy, weakness, and loss ofappetite, and should be treated as an emergency condition.\nFERTILITY. Ninety-eight percent of men with CF are\nsterile, due to complete obstruction or absence of the vasdeferens, the tube carrying sperm out of the testes. Whileboys and men with CF form normal sperm and have nor-mal levels of sex hormones, sperm are unable to leave thetestes, and fertilization is not possible. Most women withCF are fertile, though they often have more trouble get-ting pregnant than women without CF. In both boys andgirls, puberty is often delayed, most likely due to the\neffects of poor nutrition or chronic lung infection.\nWomen with good lung health usually have no problemswith pregnancy , while those with ongoing lung infec-\ntion often do poorly.\nDiagnosis\nThe decision to test a child for cystic fibrosis may be\ntriggered by concerns about recurring gastrointestinal orKEY TERMS\nCarrier —A person with one copy of a defective\ngene, who does not have the disease it causes, butcan pass along the defective gene to offspring.\nCFTR —Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduc-\ntance regulator, the protein responsible for regulat-ing chloride movement across cells in some tis-sues. When a person has two defective copies ofthe CFTR gene, cystic fibrosis is the result.\nEmphysema —A pathological accumulation of air\nin organs or tissues; term especially applied to thecondition when in the lungs.\nMucociliary escalator —The coordinated action of\ntiny projections on the surfaces of cells lining therespiratory tract, which moves mucus up and outof the lungs.\nMucolytic —An agent that dissolves or destroys\nmucin, the chief component of mucus.\nPancreatic insufficiency —Reduction or absence of\npancreatic secretions into the digestive system dueto scarring and blockage of the pancreatic duct.\nrespiratory symptoms, or salty sweat. A child born with\nmeconium ileus will be tested before leaving the hospi-tal. Families with a history of CF may wish to have allchildren tested, especially if there is a child who alreadyhas the disease. Some hospitals now require routinescreening of newborns for CF.\nSweat test\nThe sweat test is both the easiest and most accurate\ntest for CF. In this test, a small amount of the drug pilo-carpine is placed on the skin. A very small electrical cur-rent is then applied to the area, which drives the pilo-carpine into the skin. The drug stimulates sweating in thetreated area. The sweat is absorbed onto a piece of filterpaper, and is then analyzed for its salt content. A personwith CF will have salt concentrations that are one-and-one-half to two times greater than normal. The test canbe done on persons of any age, including newborns, andits results can be determined within an hour. Virtuallyevery person who has CF will test positively on it, andvirtually everyone who does not will test negatively.\nGenetic testing\nThe discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989 allowed\nthe development of an accurate genetic test for CF.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 987Cystic fibrosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 987Genes from a small blood or tissue sample are analyzed\nfor specific mutations; presence of two copies of themutated gene confirms the diagnosis of CF in all but avery few cases. However, since there are so many differ-ent possible mutations, and since testing for all of themwould be too expensive and time-consuming, a negativegene test cannot rule out the possibility of CF.\nCouples planning a family may decide to have them-\nselves tested if one or both have a family history of CF.Prenatal genetic testing is possible through amniocente-\nsis. Many couples who already have one child with CF\ndecide to undergo prenatal screening in subsequent preg-nancies, and use the results to determine whether to ter-minate the pregnancy. Siblings in these families are alsousually tested, both to determine if they will develop CF,and to determine if they are carriers, to aid in their ownfamily planning. If the sibling has no symptoms, deter-mining his carrier status is often delayed until his teenyears or later, when he is closer to needing the informa-tion to make decisions.\nNewborn screening\nSome states now require screening of newborns for\nCF, using a test known as the IRT test. This is a blood testwhich measures the level of immunoreactive trypsino-gen, which is generally higher in babies with CF thanthose without it. This test gives many false positiveresults immediately after birth, and so requires a secondtest several weeks later. A second positive result is usual-ly followed by a sweat test.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for CF. Treatment has advanced con-\nsiderably in the past several decades, increasing both thelife span and the quality of life for most people affectedby CF. Early diagnosis is important to prevent malnutri-tion and infection from weakening the young child. Withproper management, many people with CF engage in thefull range of school and sports activities.\nNutrition\nPeople with CF usually require high-calorie diets\nand vitamin supplements. Height, weight, and growth ofa person with CF are monitored regularly. Most peoplewith CF need to take pancreatic enzymes to supplementor replace the inadequate secretions of the pancreas.Tablets containing pancreatic enzymes are taken withevery meal; depending on the size of the tablet and themeal, as many as 20 tablets may be needed. Because ofincomplete absorption even with pancreatic enzymes, aperson with CF needs to take in about 30% more foodthan a person without CF. Low-fat diets are notrecom-\nmended except in special circumstances, since fat is asource of both essential fatty acids and abundant calories.\nSome people with CF cannot absorb enough nutri-\nents from the foods they eat, even with specialized dietsand enzymes. For these people, tube feeding is an option.Nutrients can be introduced directly into the stomachthrough a tube inserted either through the nose (a naso-gastric tube) or through the abdominal wall (a gastrosto-\nmytube). A jejunostomy tube, inserted into the small\nintestine, is also an option. Tube feeding can providenutrition at any time, including at night while the personis sleeping, allowing constant intake of high-qualitynutrients. The feeding tube may be removed during theday, allowing normal meals to be taken.\nRespiratory health\nThe key to maintaining respiratory health in a person\nwith CF is regular monitoring and early treatment. Lungfunction tests are done frequently to track changes infunctional lung volume and respiratory effort. Sputumsamples are analyzed to determine the types of bacteriapresent in the lungs. Chest x rays are usually taken atleast once a year. Lung scans, using a radioactive gas,can show closed off areas not seen on the x ray. Circula-tion in the lungs may be monitored by injection of aradioactive substance into the bloodstream.\nPeople with CF live with chronic bacterial coloniza-\ntion; that is, their lungs are constantly host to severalspecies of bacteria. Good general health, especially goodnutrition, can keep the immune system healthy, whichdecreases the frequency with which these colonies beginan infection, or attack on the lung tissue. Exercise is anoth-er important way to maintain health, and people with CFare encouraged to maintain a program of regular exercise.\nIn addition, clearing mucus from the lungs helps to\nprevent infection; and mucus control is an importantaspect of CF management. Postural drainage is used toallow gravity to aid the mucociliary escalator. For thistechnique, the person with CF lies on a tilted surface withhead downward, alternately on the stomach, back, or side,depending on the section of lung to be drained. An assis-tant thumps the rib cage to help loosen the secretions. Adevice called a “flutter” offers another way to loosensecretions: it consists of a stainless steel ball in a tube.When a person exhales through it, the ball vibrates, send-ing vibrations back through the air in the lungs. Some spe-cial breathing techniques may also help clear the lungs.\nSeveral drugs are available to prevent the airways\nfrom becoming clogged with mucus. Bronchodilators\nand theophyllines open up the airways; steroids reduceinflammation; and mucolytics loosen secretions. Acetyl-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 988Cystic fibrosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 988cysteine (Mucomyst) has been used as a mucolytic for\nmany years but is not prescribe frequently now, whileDNase (Pulmozyme) is a newer product gaining in popu-larity. DNase breaks down the DNA from dead whiteblood cells and bacteria found in thick mucus.\nPeople with CF may pick up bacteria from other CF\npatients. This is especially true of Burkholderia cepacia ,\nwhich is not usually found in people without CF. Whilethe ideal recommendation from a health standpoint mightbe to avoid contact with others who have CF, this is notusually practical (since CF clinics are a major site of care),nor does it meet the psychological and social needs ofmany people with CF. At a minimum, CF centers recom-mend avoiding prolonged close contact between peoplewith CF, and scrupulous hygiene, including frequent handwashing. Some CF clinics schedule appointments on dif-ferent days for those with and without B. cepacia colonies.\nSome doctors choose to prescribe antibiotics only dur-\ning infection, while others prefer long-term antibiotic treat-ment against S. aureus . The choice of antibiotic depends on\nthe particular organism or organisms found. Some antibi-otics are given as aerosols directly into the lungs. Antibiotictreatment may be prolonged and aggressive.\nSupplemental oxygen may be needed as lung dis-\nease progresses. Respiratory failure may develop,\nrequiring temporary use of a ventilator to perform thework of breathing.\nLung transplantation has become increasingly\ncommon for people with CF, although the number ofpeople who receive them is still much lower than thosewho want them. Transplantation is not a cure, however,and has been likened to trading one disease for another.Long-term immunosuppression is required, increasingthe likelihood of other types of infection. About 50% ofadults and more than 80% of children who receive lungtransplants live longer than two years. Liver transplantsare also done for CF patients whose livers have beendamaged by fibrosis.\nLong-term use of ibuprofen has been shown to help\nsome people with CF, presumably by reducing inflam-mation in the lungs. Close medical supervision is neces-sary, however, since the effective dose is high and noteveryone benefits. Ibuprofen at the required doses inter-feres with kidney function, and together with aminogly-coside antibiotics, may cause kidney failure.\nA number of experimental treatments are currently\nthe subject of much research. Some evidence indicatesthat aminoglycoside antibiotics may help overcome thegenetic defect in some CF mutations, allowing the pro-tein to be made normally. While promising, these resultswould apply to only about 5% of those with CF.Gene therapy is currently the most ambitious\napproach to curing CF. In this set of techniques, non-defective copies of the CFTR gene are delivered toaffected cells, where they are taken up and used to createthe CFTR protein. While elegant and simple in theory,gene therapy has met with a large number of difficultiesin trials so far, including immune resistance, very shortduration of the introduced gene, and inadequately wide-spread delivery.\nAlternative treatment\nIn homeopathic medicine, the symptoms of the disease\nwould be addressed to enhance the quality of life for theperson with cystic fibrosis. Treating the cause of CF,because of the genetic basis for the disease, is not possible.Homeopathic medicine seeks to treat the whole person,however, and in CF, this approach might include:\n• mucolytics to help thin mucous\n• supplementation of pancreatic enzymes to assist in\ndigestion\n• respiratory symptoms can be addressed to open lung\npassages\n• hydrotherapy techniques to help ease the respiratory\nsymptoms and help the body eliminate\n• immune enhancements can help revent the develop-\nment of secondary infections\n• dietary enhancements and adjustments are used to treat\ndigestive and nutritional problems\nPrognosis\nPeople with CF may lead relatively normal lives with\nthe control of symptoms. The possible effect of pregnancyon the health of a woman with CF requires careful consid-eration before beginning a family as do issues of longevi-ty and their children’s status as carriers. Although mostmen with CF are functionally sterile, new procedures forremoving sperm from the testes are being tried, and mayoffer more men the chance to become fathers.\nApproximately half of people with CF live past the\nage of 30. Because of better and earlier treatment, a per-son born today with CF is expected, on average, to live toage 40.\nPrevention\nAdults with a family history of cystic fibrosis may\nobtain a genetic test of their carrier status for purposes offamily planning. Prenatal testing is also available. Thereis currently no known way to prevent development of CFin a person with two defective gene copies.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 989Cystic fibrosisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 989Resources\nBOOKS\nHarris, Ann, and Maurice Super.

    "title": "Cystinuria",
    "content": "Cystinuria\nDefinition\nCystinuria is an inborn error of amino acid transport\nthat results in the defective absorption by the kidneys ofthe amino acid called cystine. The name means “cystinein the urine.”\nDescription\nCystine is an amino acid. Amino acids are organic\ncompounds needed by the body to make proteins and formany normal functions. When the kidneys don’t absorbcystine, this compound builds up in the urine. When theamount of cystine in the urine exceeds its solubility (thegreatest amount that can be dissolved), crystals form. Asthe amount of cystine continues to increase in the urine,the number of crystals also increases. When very largenumbers of cystine crystals form, they clump togetherinto what is called a stone.\nCauses and symptoms\nCystinuria is a rare disease that occurs when people\ninherit an abnormal gene from their parents. This diseaseoccurs in differing degrees of severity in people whohave inherited either one or two abnormal genes.Humans have two copies of each gene. When both areabnormal, the condition is called homozygous for thedisease. When one copy is normal and the other is abnor-mal, the condition is called heterozygous for the disease.Persons with one abnormal gene can have a milder formof cystinuria that rarely results in the formation of stones.\nSevere cystinuria occurs when people are homozy-\ngous for the disease. For these individuals, the kidneysmay excrete as much as 30 times the normal amount ofcystine. Research has shown that this condition is causedby mutations on chromosome number two (humans have23 pairs of chromosomes).\nA person who has inherited cystinuria may have\nother abnormal bodily functions. In addition to excesslevels of the amino acid cystine, high amounts of theamino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine are found inthe urine. This condition indicates that these amino acidsare not being reabsorbed by the body.\nWhen excess cystine crystals clump together to form\na stone, the stone can block portions of the interior of thekidney or the tube (the ureter) that connects the kidney tothe urinary bladder. These cystine stones can be painful,and depending upon where the stone becomes trapped,the pain can be felt in the lower back or the abdomen.\nNausea and vomiting can also occur, and patients may\nsometimes feel the need to urinate often. Cystine stonescan also cause blood in the urine. When the urinary tractis blocked by a stone, urinary tract infections or kidneyfailure may result.\nDiagnosis\nSmall stones (called “silent”) often do not cause any\nsymptoms, although they can be detected by an x ray.Large stones are often painful and easily noticed by thepatient. Blood in the urine can also mean that a stone hasformed.\nWhen the urine contains extremely high amounts of\ncystine, yellow-brown hexagonal crystals are visiblewhen a sample is examined under the microscope. Urinesamples can also be mixed with chemicals that changecolor when high levels of cystine are present. When thecompound nitroprusside is added to urine that has beenmade alkaline by the addition of ammonia, the urinespecimen turns red if it contains excess cystine.\nTreatment\nNo treatment can decrease cystine excretion. The\nbest treatment for cystinuria is to prevent stones fromforming. Stones can be prevented by drinking enoughliquid each day (about 5–7 qts) to produce at least 8 ptsof urine, thus keeping the concentration of cystine in theurine low. Because a person doesn’t drink throughout thenight, less urine is produced, and the likelihood of stoneformation increases. This risk can be minimized bydrinking water or other liquids just before going to bed.\nDrug treatments\nIn addition to drinking large amounts of fluids, it is\nhelpful to make the urine more alkaline. Cystine dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 990CystinuriaGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 990solves more easily in alkaline urine. To increase urine\nalkalinity, a person may take sodium bicarbonate andacetazolamide. Penicillamine, a drug that increases thesolubility of cystine, may be prescribed for patients whodo not respond well to other therapies. This drug must beused with caution, however, because it can cause seriousside effects or allergic reactions. For those unable to takepenicillamine, another drug, alpha-mercaptopropionyl-glycine (Thiola), may be prescribed.\nSurgical treatments\nMost stones can be removed from the body by nor-\nmal urination, helped by drinking large amounts ofwater. Large stones that cannot be passed this way mustbe removed by surgical procedures.\nLarge stones can be surgically removed by having a\ndevice called a uretoscope placed into the urethra, upthrough the bladder and into the ureter, where the trappedstone can be seen and removed. Another method involvesusing sound-wave energy aimed from outside the body tobreak the large stone into small pieces that can be passedby urination. This external technique is called extracor-poreal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL).\nFor large stones in the kidney, a procedure called per-\ncutaneous nephrolithomy may be used. In this procedure,the surgeon makes a small incision in the back over thekidney. An instrument called a nephroscope is insertedthrough the incision into the kidney. The surgeon uses thenephroscope to locate and remove the stone. If the stoneis very large, it may be broken up into smaller pieces byan ultrasonic or other kind of probe before removal.\nPrognosis\nAs many as 50% of patients who have had surgical\ntreatment for a kidney stone will have another stonewithin five years if no medicines are used to treat thiscondition.\nPrevention\nCystinuria is a genetic disorder that currently cannot\nbe prevented.\nResources\nBOOKS\nElsas, Louis S., Nicola Longo, and Leon E.

    "content": "Cystitis\nDefinition\nCystitis is defined as inflammation of the urinary blad-\nder. Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra, which is\nthe passageway that connects the bladder with the exteriorof the body. Sometimes cystitis and urethritis are referredto collectively as a lower urinary tract infection, or UTI.Infection of the upper urinary tract involves the spread ofbacteria to the kidney and is called pyelonephritis .\nDescription\nThe frequency of bladder infections in humans varies\nsignificantly according to age and sex. The male/female\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 991CystitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 991ratio of UTIs in children younger than 12 months is 4:1\nbecause of the high rate of birth defects in the urinary\ntract of male infants. In adult life, the male/female ratio ofUTIs is 1:50. After age 50, however, the incidence amongmales increases due to prostate disorders.\nCystitis in women\nCystitis is a common female problem. It is estimated\nthat 50% of adult women experience at least one episodeof dysuria (painful urination); half of these patients havea bacterial UTI. Between 2–5% of women’s visits to pri-mary care doctors are for UTI symptoms. About 90% ofUTIs in women are uncomplicated but recurrent.\nCystitis in men\nUTIs are uncommon in younger and middle-aged\nmen, but may occur as complications of bacterial infec-tions of the kidney or prostate gland.\nCystitis in children\nIn children, cystitis is often caused by congenital\nabnormalities (present at birth) of the urinary tract. Vesi-\ncoureteral reflux is a condition in which the child can-\nnot completely empty the bladder. It allows urine toremain in or flow backward (reflux) into the partiallyempty bladder.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of cystitis vary according to sex because of\nthe differences in anatomical structure of the urinary tract.\nFemales\nMost bladder infections in women are so-called\nascending infections, which means that they are causedby disease agents traveling upward through the urethra tothe bladder. The relative shortness of the female urethra(1.2–2 in in length) makes it easy for bacteria to gainentry to the bladder and multiply. The most common bac-teria associated with UTIs in women include Escherichia\ncoli(about 80% of cases), Staphylococcus saprophyticus ,\nKlebsiella ,Enterobacter , and Proteus species. Risk fac-\ntors for UTIs in women include:\n• Sexual intercourse. The risk of infection increases if the\nwoman has multiple partners.\n• Use of a diaphragm for contraception\n• An abnormally short urethra\n• Diabetes or chronic dehydration\n• The absence of a specific enzyme (fucosyltransferase)\nin vaginal secretions. The lack of this enzyme makes iteasier for the vagina to harbor bacteria that cause UTIs.• Inadequate personal hygiene. Bacteria from fecal matter\nor vaginal discharges can enter the female urethrabecause its opening is very close to the vagina and anus.\n• History of previous UTIs. About 80% of women with\ncystitis develop recurrences within two years.\nThe early symptoms of cystitis in women are\ndysuria, or pain on urination; urgency, or a sudden\nstrong desire to urinate; and increased frequency of uri-nation. About 50% of female patients experience fever ,\npain in the lower back or flanks, nausea and vomiting ,\nor shaking chills. These symptoms indicate pyelonephri-tis, or spread of the infection to the upper urinary tract.\nMales\nMost UTIs in adult males are complications of kid-\nney or prostate infections. They are usually associatedwith a tumor or kidney stones that block the flow of\nurine and are often persistent infections caused by drug-resistant organisms. UTIs in men are most likely to becaused by E. coli or another gram-negative bacterium. S.\nsaprophyticus , which is the second most common cause\nof UTIs in women, rarely causes infections in men. Riskfactors for UTIs in men include:\n• Lack of circumcision . The foreskin can harbor bacteria\nthat cause UTIs.\n• Urinary catheterization. The longer the period of\ncatheterization, the higher the risk of UTIs.\nThe symptoms of cystitis and pyelonephritis in men\nare the same as in women.\nHemorrhagic cystitis\nHemorrhagic cystitis, which is marked by large\nquantities of blood in the urine, is caused by an acutebacterial infection of the bladder. In some cases, hemor-rhagic cystitis is a side effect of radiation therapy or\ntreatment with cyclophosphamide. Hemorrhagic cystitisin children is associated with adenovirus type 11.\nDiagnosis\nWhen cystitis is suspected, the doctor will first\nexamine the patient’s abdomen and lower back, to evalu-ate unusual enlargements of the kidneys or swelling ofthe bladder. In small children, the doctor will check forfever, abdominal masses, and a swollen bladder.\nThe next step in diagnosis is collection of a urine\nsample. The procedure differs somewhat for women andmen. Laboratory testing of urine samples can now beperformed with dipsticks that indicate immune systemresponses to infection, as well as with microscopicanalysis of samples. Normal human urine is sterile. The\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 992CystitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 992presence of bacteria or pus in the urine usually indicates\ninfection. The presence of hematuria, or blood in theurine, may indicate acute UTIs, kidney disease, kidneystones, inflammation of the prostate (in men),endometriosis (in women), or cancer of the urinary\ntract. In some cases, blood in the urine results from ath-letic training, particularly in runners.\nFemales\nFemale patients require a pelvic examination as part\nof the procedure to obtain urine specimens. The patientlies on an obstetrical table with legs in the stirrups. Thedoctor first takes a vaginal culture smear. The patient isthen asked to void while lying on the table. The first5–10 ml are collected to test for urethral infection. Amidstream urine sample of 200 ml is then collected totest for bladder infection.\nIn women, a vaginal bacterial count that is higher\nthan those of the two urine samples indicates vaginitis. Ahigh bacterial count in the first urine sample indicatesurethritis. A count of more than 104 bacteria CFU/ml(colony forming units per milliliter) in the midstreamsample indicates a bladder or kidney infection. A colonyis a large number of microorganisms that grow from asingle cell within a substance called a culture. A bacterialcount can be given in CFU (colony forming units).\nMales\nIn male patients, the doctor will cleanse the opening\nto the urethra with an antiseptic before collecting theurine sample. The first 10 ml of specimen are collectedseparately. The patient then voids a midstream sample of200 ml. Following the second sample, the doctor willmassage the patient’s prostate and collect several dropsof prostatic fluid. The patient then voids a third urinespecimen for prostatic culture.\nA high bacterial count in the first urine specimen or\nthe prostatic specimens indicates urethritis or prostateinfections respectively. A bacterial count greater than100,000 bacteria CFU/ml in the midstream sample sug-gests a bladder or kidney infection.\nOther tests\nWomen with recurrent UTIs can be given ultrasound\ntests of the kidneys and bladder together with a voidingcystourethrogram to test for structural abnormalities. (Acystourethrogram is an x-ray test in which an iodine dyeis used to better view the urinary bladder and urethra.)V oiding cystourethrograms are also used to evaluate chil-dren with UTIs. In some cases, computed tomography\nscans (CT scans) can be used to evaluate patients for\npossible cancers in the urinary tract.KEY TERMS\nBacteriuria —The presence of bacteria in the urine.\nDysuria —Painful or difficult urination.\nHematuria —The presence of blood in the urine.\nPyelonephritis —Bacterial inflammation of the\nupper urinary tract.\nUrethritis —Inflammation of the urethra, which is\nthe passage through which the urine moves fromthe bladder to the outside of the body.\nTreatment\nMedications\nUncomplicated cystitis is treated with antibiotics .\nThese include penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin;sulfisoxazole or sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim;nitrofurantoin; cephalosporins ; or fluoroquinolones .\n(Flouroquinolones are generally not used in childrenunder 18 years of age.) Treatment for women is short-term; most patients respond within three days. Men donot respond as well to short-term treatment andrequire seven to 10 days of oral antibiotics for uncom-plicated UTIs.\nPatients of either sex may be given phenazopyridine\nor flavoxate to relieve painful urination.\nTrimethoprim and nitrofurantoin are preferred for\ntreating recurrent UTIs in women.\nOver 50% of older men with UTIs also suffer\nfrom infection of the prostate gland. Some antibiotics,including amoxicillin and the cephalosporins, do notaffect the prostate gland. Fluoroquinolone antibioticsor trimethoprim are the drugs of choice for thesepatients.\nPatients with pyelonephritis can be treated with oral\nantibiotics or intramuscular doses of cephalosporins.Medications are given for 10–14 days, and sometimeslonger. If the patient requires hospitalization because ofhigh fever and dehydration caused by vomiting, antibi-otics can be given intravenously.\nSurgery\nA minority of women with complicated UTIs may\nrequire surgical treatment to prevent recurrent infections.Surgery is also used to treat reflux problems (movementof the urine backwards) or other structural abnormalitiesin children and anatomical abnormalities in adult males.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 993CystitisGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 993Alternative treatment\nAlternative treatment for cystitis may emphasize elim-\ninating all sugar from the diet and drinking lots of water.Drinking unsweetened cranberry juice not only adds fluid,but is also thought to help prevent cystitis by making itmore difficult for bacteria to cling to the bladder wall. Avariety of herbal therapies are also recommended. General-ly, the recommended herbs are antimicrobials, such as gar-lic (Allium sativum ), goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ),\nand bearberry ( Arctostaphylos uva-ursi ), and/or demul-\ncents that soothe and coat the urinary tract, including cornsilk and marsh mallow ( Althaea officinalis ).\nHomeopathic medicine can also be effective in treat-\ning cystitis. Choosing the correct remedy based on theindividual’s symptoms is always key to the success ofthis type of treatment. Acupuncture and Chinese tradi-\ntional herbal medicine can also be helpful in treatingacute and chronic cases of cystitis.\nPrognosis\nFemales\nThe prognosis for recovery from uncomplicated cys-\ntitis is excellent.\nMales\nThe prognosis for recovery from uncomplicated\nUTIs is excellent; however, complicated UTIs in malesare difficult to treat because they often involve bacteriathat are resistant to commonly used antibiotics.\nPrevention\nFemales\nWomen with two or more UTIs within a six-month\nperiod are sometimes given prophylactic treatment, usu-ally nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim for three to sixmonths. In some cases the patient is advised to take anantibiotic tablet following sexual intercourse.\nOther preventive measures for women include:\n• drinking large amounts of fluid• voiding frequently, particularly after intercourse• proper cleansing of the area around the urethra\nMales\nThe primary preventive measure for males is prompt\ntreatment of prostate infections. Chronic prostatitis may\ngo unnoticed, but can trigger recurrent UTIs. In addition,males who require temporary catheterization followingsurgery can be given antibiotics to lower the risk of UTIs.Resources\nBOOKS\nAnderson, E.

    "title": "Cystometry",
    "content": "Cystometry\nDefinition\nCystometry is a test of bladder function in which\npressure and volume of fluid in the bladder is measuredduring filling, storage, and voiding.\nPurpose\nThe urinary bladder stores urine produced by the kid-\nneys. The main muscle of the bladder wall, the detrusor,relaxes to allow expansion of the bladder during filling.The urethra, the tube through which urine exits, is heldclosed by a ring of muscle, known as the urethral sphinc-ter. As volume increases, stretching of the detrusor andpressure on the sphincter sends signals to the brain, indi-cating the need for urination, or voiding. V oluntary relax-ation of the sphincter and automatic contractions of thedetrusor allow successful and virtually complete voiding.\nA cystometry study is performed to diagnose prob-\nlems with urination, including incontinence, urinaryretention, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urinarydifficulties may occur because of weak or hyperactivesphincter or detrusor, or incoordination of their two\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 994CystometryGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 994activities. Infection of the bladder or urethra may cause\nincontinence, as can obstruction of the urethra from scartissue, prostate enlargement, or other benign or cancer-ous growths. Loss of sensation due to nerve damage canlead to chronic overfilling.\nPrecautions\nThe mild irritation of the urinary tract necessary for\ninsertion of the catheter may occasionally cause flushing,sweating, and nausea.\nDescription\nThe patient begins by emptying the bladder as much\nas possible. A thin plastic catheter is then slowly insertedinto the urethra until it reaches the bladder. Measure-ments are taken of the residual urine volume and bladderpressure. Pressure measurements may require a rectalprobe to account for the contribution of the abdominalmuscles to the pressure recording.\nThe bladder is then gradually filled with either warm\nwater, room temperature water, saline solution, carbon diox-ide gas, or a contrast solution for x-ray analysis, dependingon the type of study being done. The patient is asked todescribe sensations during filling, including temperaturesensations and when the first feeling of bladder fullnessoccurs. Once the bladder is completely full, the patient isasked to begin voiding, and measurements are again madeof pressure and volume, as well as flow rate and pressure.\nPreparation\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\nThe patient may be asked to stop taking certain medica-tions in advance of the test, including sedatives, choliner-gics, and anticholinergics.\nAftercare\nCystometry can be somewhat uncomfortable. The\npatient may wish to reserve an hour or so afterward torecover. Urinary frequency or urgency, and some redden-ing of the urine, may last for a day. Increasing fluid intakehelps to flush out the bladder, but caffeinated, carbonated,or alcoholic beverages are discouraged, because they mayirritate the bladder lining. Signs of infection, such asfever , chills, low back pain , or persistent blood in the\nurine, should be reported to the examining physician.\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk of infection due to tearing of\nthe urethral lining.KEY TERMS\nDetrusor —Muscle of the bladder wall.\nSphincter —Ring of muscle between the bladder\nand the urethra that functions to close off the ure-thra.\nUrethra —Tube that empties urine from the blad-\nder to the exterior of the body.\nNormal results\nThe normal bladder should not begin contractions\nduring filling and should initially expand without resis-tance. A feeling of fullness occurs with a volume of100–200 ml. The adult bladder capacity is 300–500 ml.The sphincter should relax and open when the patientwills it, accompanied by detrusor contractions. Duringvoiding, detrusor contraction should be smooth and leadto a steady urine stream.\nAbnormal results\nInability of the bladder to relax during filling, or low\nbladder volume, may indicate interstitial cystitis , prostate\nenlargement, or bladder cancer . Contraction of the blad-\nder during filling may be due to irritation from infectionor cysts, obstruction of the bladder outlet, or neurologicaldisease such as stroke ,multiple sclerosis , or spinal cord\ninjury . Diminished sensation may occur with nerve\nlesions, peripheral neuropathy , or chronic overfilling.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLamm D. L., A. S. Paola, and F. A. Paola.

Performed with an optic instrument known as acystoscope (urethroscope), this instrument uses a lightedtip for guidance to aid in diagnosing urinary tract diseaseand prostate disease. Performed by a urologist, this surgi-cal test also enables biopsies to be taken or small stonesto be removed by way of a hollow channel in the cysto-scope.\nPurpose\nCategorized as an endoscopic procedure, cystoscopy\nis used by urologists to examine the entire bladder liningand take biopsies of any areas that look questionable. Thistest is not used on a routine basis, but may benefit the urol-ogist who is needing further information about a patientwho displays the following symptoms or diagnosis:\n• blood in the urine (also known as hematuria)\n• incontinence or the inabililty to control urination\n• a urinary tract infection• a urinary tract which display signs of congenital abnor-\nmalities\n• tumors located in the bladder\n• the presence of bladder or kidney stones\n• a stiffness or strained feeling of the urethra or ureters\n• symptoms of an enlarged prostate\nBlood and urine studies, in addition to x rays of the\nkidneys, ureters, and bladder, may all occur before a cys-toscopy. At the time of surgery, a retrograde pyelogrammay also be performed. Additional blood studies may beneeded immediately following surgery.\nPrecautions\nWhile the cystoscopy procedure is commonly relied\nupon to gather additional diagnostic information, it is aninvasive surgical technique that may involve risks for certainpatients. Those who are extremely overweight (obese),smoke, are recovering from a recent illness, or are treating achronic condition may face additional risks from surgery.\nSurgical risk also increases in patients who are cur-\nrently using certain drugs including antihypertensives;muscle relaxants ; tranquilizers; sleep inducers; insulin;\nsedatives; beta blockers ; or cortisone. Those who use\nmind-altering drugs also put themselves at increased risk ofcomplications during surgery. The following mind-alteringdrugs should be avoided: narcotics; psychedelics; hallu-cinogens; marijuana; sedatives; hypnotics; or cocaine .\nDescription\nDepending on the type of information needed from a\ncystoscopy, the procedure typically takes 10–40 minutesto complete. The patient will be asked to urinate beforesurgery which allows an accurate measurement of theremaining urine in the bladder. A well lubricated cysto-scope is inserted through the urethra into the bladderwhere a urine sample is taken. Fluid is then pushed in toinflate the bladder and allow the urologist to examine theentire bladder wall.\nDuring an examination, the urologist may take the fol-\nlowing steps: remove either bladder or kidney stones; gathertissue samples; and treat any suspicious lesions. In order toperform x-ray studies (retrograde pyelogram), a harmlessdye is injected into the ureters by way of a catheter that ispassed through the previously placed cystoscope.

Kapes\nCystourethroscopy seeCystoscopy\nCytomegalic inclusion disease see\nCytomegalovirus infection\nCytomegalovirus antibody\nscreening test\nDefinition\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common human virus.\nAntibodies to CMV are evidence of a current or pastinfection.KEY TERMS\nEndoscopy —Examination of body organs or cavities\nthrough the use of an endoscope (a lighted opticalinstrument used to see inside body cavities), such asa cystoscope used to complete a cystoscopy.\nRetrograde pyelogram —A pyelography or x-ray\ntechnique where radiopaque dye is injected intothe kidneys from below, by way of the ureters,allowing further examination of the kidneys.\nUreter —The tube that carries urine from the kidney\nto the bladder, with each kidney having one ureter.\nUrethra —A passageway from the bladder to the\noutside for the discharge of urine. In the female,this canal lies between the vagina and clitoris; inthe male, the urethra travels through the penis,opening at the tip.Purpose\nConsequences of a CMV infection can be devastating\nin a pregnant woman, a transplant patient, or a personwith human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antibody\nscreening helps control the infection risk for these groups.\nIn a healthy, nonpregnant person, CMV infection is\nalmost never serious. Symptoms, if present, are mild,often resembling infectious mononucleosis due to\nEpstein-Barr virus. Antibody screening distinguishesbetween these two infections.\nDescription\nWhen first exposed to CMV , a person’s immune sys-\ntem is triggered and quickly makes antibodies to fight thevirus. Antibodies are special proteins designed to attackand destroy foreign material, in this case, the cytomega-lovirus.\nThe test combines a person’s serum with a substance\nto which CMV antibodies attach. This antibody-antigencomplex is measured and the amount of original anti-body determined. If positive for antibodies, the serum isdiluted, or titered, and the test repeated until the serum isso dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The last dilu-tion that gives a positive result is the titer reported.\nA test positive for CMV antibodies means the per-\nson has been infected with the virus, either currently orin the past; it doesn’t mean the person has lifetime immu-nity. After an infection, this virus, like all members of theherpes virus group, can stay hidden inside a person andcause infection if the person’s immune system laterweakens and antibody protection decreases. In fact, reac-tivation of such hidden (or latent) infection is not at alluncommon and usually occurs without symptoms.\nTransplant patients and people with weakened\nimmune systems, including those with HIV, are vulnera-ble to infection from several routes, including fromanother person, from a donated organ or transfusedblood, or from reactivation of a past infection. Beforetransplant, both the recipient and donor are usually testedfor antibodies. A recipient who has never had CMV (neg-ative for antibodies), should not receive an organ from adonor who has had CMV (positive for antibodies). CVMinfection can be associated with organ rejection, or cancause illness such as pneumonia , hepatitis, or death .\nSimilarly, blood is usually screened for CMV antibodiesbefore being transfused into a person with a weakenedimmune system.\nCMV infection is the most common congenital\ninfection (existing at birth). The infection, passed frommother to baby, can cause permanent mental or physicaldamage, or death. The antibody screening test tells a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 998Cytomegalovirus antibody screening testGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 998woman whether or not she has antibody protection\nagainst the virus in case she is exposed during preg-\nnancy .\nTests that measure a specific type of antibody help\ntell the difference between a current and a past infection.Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies appear at thebeginning of an infection and last only weeks.Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies appear 10–14 dayslater and can last a lifetime. A person suspected of hav-ing a current infection should be tested at the beginningof the infection and again 10–14 days later.\nThe CMV antibody screening test is also called the\ntransplant reaction screening test. Results are usuallyavailable the following day.\nPreparation\nThis test requires 5 mL of blood. Collection of the\nsample takes only a few minutes.\nAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site relieve discomfort.\nNormal results\nA person without previous exposure to CMV will\ntest negative.\nAbnormal results\nThe presence of antibodies means the person has\nbeen infected with CMV , either now or in the past. Anantibody titer at least four times higher at the end of theillness than at the beginning, or the presence of IgM anti-bodies, indicates a recent or current first time infection.\nPeople with weak immune systems may not gener-\nate antibodies against CMV .

    "content": "Cytomegalovirus infection\nDefinition\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the\ngroup of herpes viruses. Infection with CMV can causeno symptoms, or can be the source of serious illness inpeople with weak immune systems. CMV infection isalso an important cause of birth defects .\nDescription\nCMV is an extremely common organism worldwide.\nIt is believed that about 85% of the adult population in theUnited States have been infected by CMV at some pointin their lives. CMV is found in almost all of the body’sorgans. It is also found in body fluids, including semen,saliva, urine, feces, breast milk, blood, and secretions ofthe cervix (the narrow, lower section of the uterus).\nCMV is also able to cross the placenta (the organ\nthat provides oxygen and nutrients to the unborn baby inthe uterus). Because CMV can cross the placental barri-er, initial infection in a pregnant woman can lead toinfection of the developing baby.\nCauses and symptoms\nCMV is passed between people through contact with\nbody fluids. CMV can also be passed on through sexual\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 999Cytomegalovirus infectionGEM -0625 to 1002 - C  10/22/03 6:11 PM  Page 999contact. Babies can be born infected with CMV , either\nbecoming infected in the uterus (congenital infection) orduring birth (from infected cervical secretions).\nLike other herpes viruses, CMV remains inactive\n(dormant) within the body for life after the initial infec-tion. Some of the more serious types of CMV infectionsoccur in people who have been harboring the dormantvirus, only to have it reactivate when their immune sys-tem is stressed. Immune systems may be weakenedbecause of cancer chemotherapy , medications given\nafter organ transplantation, or diseases that significantlylower immune resistance like acquired immunodeficien-\ncysyndrome ( AIDS ).\nIn a healthy person, initial CMV infection often\noccurs without symptoms and is rarely noticed. Occa-sionally, a first-time infection with CMV may cause amild illness called mononucleosis. Symptoms includeswollen glands, liver, and spleen; fever ; increased white\nblood cells; headache ; fatigue ; and sore throat . About\n8% of all mononucleosis cases are due to CMV infec-tion. A similar infection, though slightly more serious,may occur two to four weeks after receiving a bloodtransfusion containing CMV .\nIn people with weakened immune systems, CMV\ninfection can cause more serious and potentially life-threatening illnesses. These illnesses include pneumo-\nnia, and inflammations of the liver (hepatitis), brain\n(encephalitis ), esophagus (esophagitis), large intestine\n(colitis), and retina of the eye (retinitis).\nBabies who contract CMV from their mothers dur-\ning birth rarely develop any illness from these infections.Infants born prematurely who become CMV infectedduring birth have a greater chance of complications,including pneumonia, hepatitis, and decreased blood\nplatelets.\nHowever, an unborn baby is at great risk for seri-\nous problems when the mother becomes infected withCMV for the first time while pregnant. About 10% ofthese babies will be born with obvious problems,including prematurity , lung problems, an enlarged\nliver and spleen, jaundice , anemia, low birth weight,\nsmall head size, and inflammation of the retina. About90% of these babies may appear perfectly normal atbirth. Unfortunately, about 20% of these babies willlater develop severe hearing impairments and mental\nretardation .\nDiagnosis\nBody fluids or tissues can be tested to reveal CMV\ninfection. However, this information is not always partic-ularly helpful because CMV stays dormant in the cellsfor life. Tests to look for special immune cells (antibod-ies) directed specifically against CMV are useful in prov-ing that a person has been infected with CMV . However,these tests do not give any information regarding whenthe CMV infection first occurred.\nTreatment\nGanciclovir and foscarnet are both antiviral med-\nications that have been used to treat patients withweak immune systems who develop a serious illnessfrom CMV (including retinitis). As of 1998, researchis still being done to try to find useful drugs to treatnewborn babies suffering from congenital infectionwith CMV . Antiviral drugs are not used to treat\nCMV infection in otherwise healthy patients becausethe drugs have significant side effects that outweightheir benefits.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis in healthy people with CMV infection\nis excellent. About 0.1% of all newborn babies willhave serious damage from CMV infection occurringwhile they were developing in the uterus. About 50%of all transplant patients will develop severe illnessesdue to reactivation of dormant CMV infection. Theseillnesses have a high rate of serious complicationsand death .\nPrevention\nPrevention of CMV infection in the normal,\nhealthy person involves good handwashing. Bloodproducts can be screened or treated to insure that theydo not contain CMV .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1000Cytomegalovirus infection\nAn infected retina of an AIDS patient.

    "title": "Dacryocystitis",
    "content": "Dacryocystitis\nDefinition\nDacryocystitis is an inflammation of the tear sac\n(lacrimal sac) at the inner corner of the eye.\nDescription\nTears drain into little openings (puncta) in the inner\ncorners of the eyelids. From there, the tears travelthrough little tube-like structures (canaliculi) to thelacrimal sac. The nasolacrimal ducts then take the tearsfrom the lacrimal sac to the nose. That’s why peopleneed to blow their nose when they cry a lot.\nDacryocystitis is usually caused by a blockage of\nthe nasolacrimal duct, which allows fluid to drain intothe nasal passages. When the lacrimal sac does notdrain, bacteria can grow in the trapped fluid. This con-dition is most common in infants and people over 40years old.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn newborn infants, the nasolacrimal duct may fail to\nform an opening—a condition called dacryostenosis. Thecause of dacryocystitis in adults is usually associatedwith inflammation and infection in the nasal region.Dacryocystitis can be acute, having a sudden onset, or itcan be chronic, with symptoms occurring over the courseof weeks or months. Symptoms of acute dacryocystitiscan include pain , redness, tearing, and swelling at the\ninner corner of the eye by the nose. In chronic dacryocys-titis, the eye area may be swollen, watery or teary, and,when pressure is applied to the area, there may be a dis-charge of pus or mucus through the punctum.Diagnosis\nDacryocystitis usually occurs in only one eye. As\nmentioned, the symptoms can range from watery eyes,pain, swelling, and redness to a discharge of pus whenpressure is applied to the area between the bridge of thenose and the inner eyelids. A sample of the pus may becollected on a swab or in a tube for laboratory analysis.The type of antibiotic and treatment may depend onwhich bacteria is present. In the acute form, a blood testmay reveal an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count;with a chronic infection, the WBC count is usually nor-mal. To identify the exact location of the blockage, an xray can be taken after a dye is injected into the duct in aprocedure called dacryocystography.D\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1003\nDacryocystitis of the right eye.The inner corner of the lower\nlid is bulging from an inflamed tear sac. Blockage of the tearduct causes fluid to be trapped in the tear sac, whichbecomes infected. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced\nby permission.)Treatment\nA warm compress applied to the area can help\nrelieve pain and promote drainage. Topical and oralantibiotics may be prescribed if an infection is present.\nIntravenous antibiotics may be needed if the infection issevere. In some cases, a tiny tube (cannula) is insertedinto the tear duct which is then flushed with a sterile saltwater solution (sterile saline). If other treatments fail toclear up the symptoms, surgery (dacryocystorhinostomy)to drain the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity can be per-formed. In extreme cases, the lacrimal sac will beremoved completely.\nIn infants, gentle massage of the lacrimal sac four\ntimes daily for up to nine months can drain the sac andsometimes clear a blockage. As the infant grows, the ductmay open by itself. If the duct does not open, it may needto be dilated with a minor surgical procedure.\nPrognosis\nTreatment of dacryocystitis with antibiotics is usual-\nly successful in clearing the infection that is present. Ifthere is a permanent blockage that prevents drainage,infection may recur and surgery may be required to openthe duct. If left untreated, the infected sac can rupture,forming an open, draining sore.KEY TERMS\nCanaliculi —Also known as lacrimal ducts, these\ntube-like structures carry the tears from the eyes tothe lacrimal sac.\nCannula — A narrow tube that can be inserted into\na duct.\nDacryocystography —An x ray of the tear duct\nafter injection of a dye that is used to help locate ablockage in the duct.\nDacryocystorhinostomy —A surgical procedure to\ndrain the tear sac into the nasal passage.\nDacryostenosis —Obstruction or narrowing of the\nnasolacrimal duct.

    "content": "Death\nDefinition\nDeath is defined as the cessation of all vital func-\ntions of the body including the heartbeat, brain activity(including the brain stem), and breathing.\nDescription\nDeath comes in many forms, whether it be expected\nafter a diagnosis of terminal illness or an unexpectedaccident or medical condition.\nTerminal illness\nWhen a terminal illness is diagnosed, a person, fam-\nily, friends, and physicians are all able to prepare for theimpending death. A terminally ill individual goesthrough several levels of emotional acceptance while inthe process of dying. First, there is denial and isolation .\nThis is followed by anger and resentment. Thirdly, a per-son tries to escape the inevitable. With the realizationthat death is eminent, most people suffer from depres-sion. Lastly, the reality of death is realized and accepted.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1004DeathCauses and symptoms\nAs of 2001, the two leading causes of death for both\nmen and women in the United States were heart diseaseand cancer . Accidental death was a distant third fol-\nlowed by such problems as stroke , chronic lung disor-\nders, pneumonia , suicide, cirrhosis ,diabetes mellitus ,\nand murder. The order of these causes of death variesamong persons of different age, ethnicity, and gender.\nDiagnosis\nIn an age of organ transplantation, identifying the\nmoment of death may now involve another life. It there-by takes on supreme legal importance. It is largely due tothe need for transplant organs that death has been so pre-cisely defined.\nThe official signs of death include the following:\n• no pupil reaction to light\n• no response of the eyes to caloric (warm or cold) stimu-\nlation\n• no jaw reflex (the jaw will react like the knee if hit with\na reflex hammer)\n• no gag reflex (touching the back of the throat induces\nvomiting)\n• no response to pain\n• no breathing\n• a body temperature above 86°F (30°C), which elimi-\nnates the possibility of resuscitation following cold-water drowning\n• no other cause for the above, such as a head injury\n• no drugs present in the body that could cause apparent\ndeath\n• all of the above for 12 hours\n• all of the above for six hours and a flat-line electroen-\ncephalogram (brain wave study)\n• no blood circulating to the brain, as demonstrated by\nangiography\nCurrent ability to resuscitate people who have\n“died” has produced some remarkable stories. Drowningin cold water (under 50°F/10°C) so effectively slowsmetabolism that some persons have been revived after ahalf hour under water.\nTreatment\nOnly recently has there been concerted public effort\nto address the care of the dying in an effort to improvetheir comfort and lessen their alienation from those stillliving. Hospice care represents one of the greatestELISABETH KÜBLER-ROSS (1926– )\nContemporary physician who has become a world\nauthority on the subject of death and after-death states.Born in Switzerland on July 8, 1926, she worked as acountry doctor before moving to the United States. Dur-ing World War II she spent weekends at the Kantonspital(Cantonai Hospital) in Zürich, where she volunteered toassist escaped refugees. After the war she visited Maj-danek concentration camp, where the horrors of thedeath chambers stimulated in her a desire to help peo-ple facing death and to understand the human impulsesof love and destruction. She extended her medicalbackground by becoming a practicing psychiatrist. Herformal work with dying patients began in 1965 whenshe was a faculty member at the University of Chicago.She also conducted research on basic questions con-cerning life after death at the Manhattan State Hospital,New York. Her studies of death and dying have involvedaccounts by patients who reported out-of-the-body trav-el. Her research tends to show that while dying can bepainful, death itself is a peaceful condition. Her 1969text, On Death and Dying , was hailed by her colleagues\nand also became a popular best-seller.\nIn 1978 Kübler-Ross helped to found Shanti Nilaya\n(Final Home of Peace), a healing and growth center inEscondido, California. This was an extension of herwell-known “Life-Death and Transition” workshopsconducted in various parts of the United States andCanada, involving physicians, nurses, social workers,laypeople, and terminally ill patients. Much of Kübler-Ross’s later research was directed toward proving theexistence of life after death. Her publication To Live\nUntil We Say Good-bye (1979) was both praised as a\n“celebration of life” and criticized as “prettifying” thereal situation. She has also dealt with issues such asAIDS and “near death” experiences. In the mid-1980sShanti Nilaya moved from San Diego County, Califor-nia, to Head Waters, Virginia, where it continues to offercourses and short- and long-term therapeutic sessions.\nadvances made in this direction. There has also been a\nliberalization of the use of narcotics and other drugs forsymptomatic relief and improvement in the quality of lifefor the dying.\nLiving will\nOne of the most difficult issues surrounding death\nin the era of technology is that there is now a choice, notof the event itself, but of its timing. When to die, andmore often, when to let a loved one die, is coming with-in people’s power to determine. This is both a blessingand a dilemma. Insofar as the decision can be made\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1005Deathahead of time, a living will is an attempt to address this\ndilemma. By outlining the conditions under which onewould rather be allowed to die, a person can contributesignificantly to that final decision, even if not competentto do so at the time of actual death. The problem is thatthere are uncertainties surrounding every severely illperson. Each instance presents a greater or lesser chanceof survival. The chance is often greater than zero. Thebest living will follows an intimate discussion with deci-sion makers covering the many possible scenarios sur-rounding the end of life. This discussion is difficult, forfew people like to contemplate their own demise. How-ever, the benefits of a living will are substantial, both tophysicians and to loved ones who are faced with makingfinal decisions. Most states have passed living will laws,honoring instructions on artificial life support that were\nmade while a person was still mentally competent.\nEuthanasia\nAnother issue that has received much attention is\nassisted suicide (euthanasia). In 1997, the State of Ore-gon placed the issue on the ballot, amid much consterna-tion and dispute. Perhaps the main reason euthanasia hasbecome front page news is because Dr. Jack Kevorkian, apathologist from Michigan, is one of its most vocal advo-cates. The issue highlights the many new problems gen-erated by increasing ability to intervene effectively in thefinal moments of life and unnaturally prolong the processof dying. The public appearance of euthanasia has alsostimulated discussion about more compassionate care ofthe dying.KEY TERMS\nAngiography —X rays of blood vessels filled with a\ncontrast agent.\nCaloric testing —Flushing warm and cold water\ninto the ear stimulates the labyrinth and causesvertigo and nystagmus if all the nerve pathwaysare intact.\nElectroencephalogram —Recording of electrical\nactivity in the brain.\nHospice —Systematized care of dying persons.\nLiving will —A legal document detailing a person’s\nwishes during the end of life, to be carried out bydesignated decision makers.\nStroke —Interruption of blood flow to a part of the\nbrain with consequent brain damage, also knownas a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).Prevention\nAutopsy after death is a way to precisely determine\na cause of death.

This knowledgecould be used to prevent illness in other family members.Information culled from an autopsy can be used to fur-ther medical research.

    "title": "Debridement",
    "content": "Debridement\nDefinition\nDebridement is the process of removing non-living\ntissue from pressure ulcers, burns , and other wounds .\nPurpose\nDebridement speeds the healing of pressure ulcers,\nburns, and other wounds. Wounds that contain non-living(necrotic) tissue take longer to heal. The necrotic tissuemay become colonized with bacteria, producing anunpleasant odor. Though the wound is not necessarilyinfected, the bacteria can cause inflammation and strainthe body’s ability to fight infection. Necrotic tissue mayalso hide pockets of pus called abscesses. Abscesses candevelop into a general infection that may lead to ampu-\ntation or death .\nPrecautions\nNot all wounds need debridement. Sometimes it is\nbetter to leave a hardened crust of dead tissue, called aneschar, than to remove it and create an open wound, partic-ularly if the crust is stable and the wound is not inflamed.Before performing debridement, the physician will take amedical history with attention to factors that might com-plicate healing, such as medications being taken andsmoking . The physician will also note the cause of the\nwound and the ways it has been treated. Some ulcers andother wounds occur in places where blood flow isimpaired, for example, the foot ulcers that can accompanydiabetes mellitus . In such cases, the physician or nursemay decide not to debride the wound because blood flow\nmay be insufficient for proper healing.\nDescription\nIn debridement, dead tissue is removed so that the\nremaining living tissue can adequately heal. Dead tissueexposed to the air will form a hard black crust, called aneschar. Deeper tissue will remain moist and may appearwhite, or yellow and soft, or flimsy. The four majordebridement techniques are surgical, mechanical, chemi-cal, and autolytic.\nSurgical debridement\nSurgical debridement (also known as sharp debride-\nment) uses a scalpel, scissors, or other instrument to cutdead tissue from a wound. It is the quickest and mostefficient method of debridement. It is the preferredmethod if there is rapidly developing inflammation of thebody’s connective tissues ( cellulitis ) or a more general-\nized infection ( sepsis ) that has entered the bloodstream.\nThe procedure can be performed at a patient’s bedside. Ifthe target tissue is deep or close to another organ, howev-er, or if the patient is experiencing extreme pain , the pro-\ncedure may be done in an operating room. Surgicaldebridement is generally performed by a physician, butin some areas of the country an advance practice nurse orphysician assistant may perform the procedure.\nThe physician will begin by flushing the area with a\nsaline (salt water) solution, and then will apply a topicalanesthetic gel to the edges of the wound to minimizepain. Using a forceps to grip the dead tissue, the physi-cian will cut it away bit by bit with a scalpel or scissors.Sometimes it is necessary to leave some dead tissuebehind rather than disturb living tissue. The physicianmay repeat the process again at another session.\nMechanical debridement\nIn mechanical debridement, a saline-moistened\ndressing is allowed to dry overnight and adhere to thedead tissue. When the dressing is removed, the dead tis-sue is pulled away too. This process is one of the oldestmethods of debridement. It can be very painful becausethe dressing can adhere to living as well as nonliving tis-sue. Because mechanical debridement cannot selectbetween good and bad tissue, it is an unacceptabledebridement method for clean wounds where a new layerof healing cells is already developing.\nChemical debridement\nChemical debridement makes use of certain enzymes\nand other compounds to dissolve necrotic tissue. It is more\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1007Debridementselective than mechanical debridement. In fact, the body\nmakes its own enzyme, collagenase, to break down colla-gen, one of the major building blocks of skin. A pharma-ceutical version of collagenase is available and is highlyeffective as a debridement agent. As with other debride-ment techniques, the area first is flushed with saline. Anycrust of dead tissue is etched in a cross-hatched pattern toallow the enzyme to penetrate. A topical antibiotic is alsoapplied to prevent introducing infection into the blood-stream. A moist dressing is then placed over the wound.\nAutolytic debridement\nAutolytic debridement takes advantage of the body’s\nown ability to dissolve dead tissue. The key to the tech-nique is keeping the wound moist, which can be accom-plished with a variety of dressings. These dressings helpto trap wound fluid that contains growth factors, enzymes,and immune cells that promote wound healing. Autolyticdebridement is more selective than any other debridementmethod, but it also takes the longest to work. It is inappro-priate for wounds that have become infected.\nPreparation\nThe physician or nurse will begin by assessing the\nneed for debridement. The wound will be examined, fre-quently by inserting a gloved finger into the wound toestimate the depth of dead tissue and evaluate whether itlies close to other organs, bone, or important body fea-tures. The area may be flushed with a saline solutionbefore debridement begins, and a topical anesthetic gelor injection may be applied if surgical or mechanicaldebridement is being performed.\nAftercare\nAfter surgical debridement, the wound will be\npacked with a dry dressing for a day to control bleeding.KEY TERMS\nEschar —A hardened black crust of dead tissue\nthat may form over a wound.\nPressure ulcer —Also known as a decubitus ulcer,\npressure ulcers are open wounds that form when-ever prolonged pressure is applied to skin coveringbony outcrops of the body. Patients who arebedridden are at risk of developing pressure ulcers.Pressure ulcers are commonly known as bedsores.\nSepsis —A severe systemic infection in which bac-\nteria have entered the blood stream.Afterward, moist dressings are applied to promote wound\nhealing. Moist dressings are also used after mechanical,chemical, and autolytic debridement. Many factors con-tribute to wound healing, which frequently can take con-siderable time. Debridement may need to be repeated.\nRisks\nIt is possible that underlying tendons, blood vessels\nor other structures will be damaged during the examina-tion of the wound and during surgical debridement. Sur-face bacteria may also be introduced deeper into thebody, causing infection.\nNormal results\nRemoval of dead tissue from pressure ulcers and other\nwounds speeds healing. Although these procedures causesome pain, they are generally well tolerated by patients andcan be managed more aggressively. It is not uncommon todebride a wound again in a subsequent session.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMaklebust, JoAnn, and Mary Y . Sieggreen.

    "title": "Decompression sickness",
    "content": "Decompression sickness\nDefinition\nDecompression sickness (DCS) is a dangerous and\noccasionally lethal condition caused by nitrogen bubblesthat form in the blood and other tissues of scuba diverswho surface too quickly.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1008Decompression sicknessDescription\nAccording to the Divers Alert Network (DAN), a\nworldwide organization devoted to safe-diving researchand promotion, less than 1% of divers fall victim to DCSor the rarer bubble problem called gas embolism , air\nembolism , or arterial gas embolism (AGE). A study of the\nUnited States military community in Okinawa, where tensof thousands of sport and military dives are made eachyear, identified 84 DCS and 10 AGE cases in 1989–95,including nine deaths. This translated into estimates of onecase in every 7,400 dives and one death in every 76,900\ndives. DCS symptoms can be quite mild, however, andmany cases certainly go unnoticed by divers.\nAt times the terminology adopted by writers on\nDCS can be confusing. Some substitute the termdecompression illness (DCI) for DCS. Others treat DCIas a label encompassing both DCS and AGE. An olderterm for DCS is caisson disease, coined in the nine-teenth century when it was discovered that bridge con-struction crews working at the bottom of lakes andrivers in large pressurized enclosures (caissons) wereexperiencing joint pain (a typical DCS symptom) on\nreturning to the surface.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe air we breathe is mostly a mixture of two gases,\nnitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). Unlike oxygen, nitro-gen is a biologically inert gas, meaning that it is notmetabolized (converted into other substances) by thebody. For this reason, most of the nitrogen we inhale isexpelled when we exhale, but some is dissolved into theblood and other tissues. During a dive, however, thelungs take in more nitrogen than usual. This happensbecause the surrounding water pressure is greater thanthe air pressure at sea level (twice as great at 33 ft [10 m],for instance). As the water pressure increases, so does thepressure of the nitrogen in the compressed air inhaled bythe diver. Because increased pressure causes an increasein gas density, the diver takes in more nitrogen with eachbreath than he or she would at sea level. Instead of beingexhaled, however, the extra nitrogen safely dissolves intothe tissues, where it remains until the diver begins his orher return to the surface (under some circumstances theextra nitrogen can cause nitrogen narcosis , but that con-\ndition is distinct from DCS). On the way up, decompres-sion occurs (in other words, the water pressure drops),and with the change in pressure, the extra nitrogen grad-ually diffuses out of the tissues and is delivered by thebloodstream to the lungs, which expel it from the body. Ifthe diver surfaces too quickly, however, potentially dan-gerous nitrogen bubbles can form in the tissues and causeDCS. These bubbles can compress nerves, obstruct arter-ies, veins, and lymphatic vessels, and trigger harmful\nchemical reactions in the blood. The precise reasons forbubble formation remain unclear.\nHow much extra nitrogen enters the tissues varies\nwith the dive’s depth and duration. Dive tables preparedby the U.S. Navy and other organizations specify howlong most divers can safely remain at a particular depth.If the dive table limits are exceeded, the diver must pauseon the way up to allow the nitrogen to diffuse into thebloodstream without forming bubbles; these pauses arecalled decompression stops, and are carefully calibrated.DCS can occur, however, even when a diver obeys safediving rules. In such cases, the predisposing factorsinclude fatigue ,obesity ,dehydration ,hypothermia ,\nand recent alcohol use. As well, people who fly or travelto high-altitude locations without letting 12–24 hourspass after their last dive are at risk for DCS as wellbecause their bodies undergo further decompression.This is true even when flying in commercial aircraft.Many travelers are unaware that to save money on fuelthe cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is set muchlower than the pressure at sea level. At 30,000 ft (9,144m), for instance, cabin pressure is usually equivalent tothe pressure at 7,000–8,000 ft (2,133–2,438 m) above sealevel, a safe setting for everyone but recent divers. Exact-ly how long a diver should wait before flying or travelingto a high-altitude location depends on how much divinghe or she has done and other considerations. If there isuncertainty about the appropriate waiting period, the sen-sible course of action is to let the full 24 hours pass.\nBecause the nitrogen bubbles that cause DCS can\naffect any of the body’s tissues, including the blood,bones, nerves, and muscles, many kinds of symptoms arepossible. Symptoms can appear minutes after a diver sur-faces, and in about 80% of cases do so within eighthours. Pain is often the only symptom; this is sometimescalled the bends, although many people incorrectly usethat term as a synonym for DCS itself. The pain, whichranges from mild to severe, is usually limited to thejoints, but can be felt anywhere. Severe itching (pruritis),\nskin rashes , and skin mottling (cutis marmorata) are\nother possible symptoms. All of these are sometimesclassified as manifestations of type 1 or “mild” DCS.type 2 or “serious” DCS can lead, among other things, toparalysis , brain damage, heart attacks, and death. Many\nDCS victims, however, experience both type 1 and type 2symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis requires taking a medical history (ques-\ntioning the patient about his or her health and recentactivities) and conducting a physical examination .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1009Decompression sicknessTreatment\nDCS is treated by giving the patient oxygen and\nplacing him or her in a hyperbaric chamber, an enclosurein which the air pressure is first gradually increased andthen gradually decreased. This shrinks the bubbles andallows the nitrogen to safely diffuse out of the tissues.Hyperbaric chamber facilities exist throughout the Unit-ed States. No matter how mild one’s symptoms mayappear, immediate transportation to a facility is essential.Treatment is necessary even if the symptoms clear upbefore the facility is reached, because bubbles may stillbe in the bloodstream and pose a threat. DAN maintainsa list of facilities and a 24-hour hotline that can provideadvice on handling DCS and other diving emergencies.\nPrognosis\nDCS sufferers who undergo chamber treatment within\na few hours of symptom onset usually enjoy a full recovery.If treatment is delayed the consequences are less pre-dictable, although many people have been helped even afterseveral days have passed. A 1992 DAN report on divingaccidents indicated that full recovery following chambertreatment was immediate for about 50% of divers. Somepeople, however, suffer numbness, tingling, or other symp-toms that last weeks, months, or even a lifetime. In the Oki-nawa study, six of the 94 patients experienced “long-last-ing” symptoms even after repeated chamber treatments.\nPrevention\nThe obvious way to minimize the risk of falling vic-\ntim to DCS is to follow the rules on safe diving and airKEY TERMS\nGas embolism —The presence of a gas bubble in\nthe bloodstream that obstructs circulation.\nHyperbaric chamber —A sealed compartment in\nwhich air pressure is gradually increased and thengradually decreased, allowing nitrogen bubbles toshrink and the nitrogen to safely diffuse out ofbody tissue.\nLymphatic vessels —Vessels that carry a fluid\ncalled lymph from the tissues to the bloodstream.\nNitrogen narcosis —Also called “rapture of the\ndeep,” the condition is caused by increased nitro-gen pressure at depth and is characterized bysymptoms similar to alcohol intoxication.travel after a dive.

    "title": "Decongestants",
    "content": "Decongestants\nDefinition\nDecongestants are medicines used to relieve nasal\ncongestion (stuffy nose).\nPurpose\nA congested or stuffy nose is a common symptom of\ncolds and allergies . This congestion results when mem-\nbranes lining the nose become swollen. Decongestantsrelieve the swelling by narrowing the blood vessels thatsupply the nose. This reduces the blood supply to theswollen membranes, causing the membranes to shrink.\nThese medicines do not cure colds or reverse the\neffects of histamines—chemicals released as part of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1010Decongestantsallergic reaction. They will not relieve all of the symptoms\nassociated with colds and allergies, only the stuffiness.\nWhen considering whether to use a decongestant for\ncold symptoms, keep in mind that most colds go awaywith or without treatment and that taking medicine is notthe only way to relieve a stuffy nose. Drinking hot tea orbroth or eating chicken soup may help. There are alsoadhesive strips can be placed on the nose to help widenthe nasal passages, making breathing through the nasalpassages a bit easier when congestion is present.\nPrecautions\nDecongestant nasal sprays and nose drops may\ncause a problem called rebound congestion if usedrepeatedly over several days. When this happens, thenose remains stuffy or gets worse with every dose. Theonly way to stop the cycle is to stop using the drug. Thestuffiness should then go away within about a week.Anyone who shows signs of severe rebound congestionshould also contact his or her physician.\nDo not use decongestant nasal sprays for more than\nthree days. Decongestants taken by mouth should not beused for more than seven days. If the congestion has notgone away in this time, or if the symptoms are accompa-nied by fever , call a physician.\nDo not use a decongestant nasal spray after the prod-\nuct’s expiration date. If the product has become cloudyor discolored, throw it away and do not use it. Do notshare droppers or spray bottles with anyone else, as thiscould spread infection. Do not let droppers and bottletips touch countertops or other surfaces.\nSome decongestants cause drowsiness. People who\ntakes these drugs should not drive, use machines or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.\nIn general, older people may be more sensitive to the\neffects of decongestants and may need to take lowerdoses to avoid side effects. People in this age groupshould not take long-acting (extended release) forms ofdecongestants unless they have previously taken a short-acting form with no ill effects.\nChildren may also be more sensitive to the effects of\ndecongestants. Before giving any decongestant to achild, check the package label carefully. Some of thesemedicines are too strong for use in children. Serious sideeffects are possible if they are given large amounts ofthese drugs or if they swallow nose drops, nasal spray oreye drops. If this happens, call a physician or poison cen-ter immediately.Special conditions\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake decongestants. Before taking these drugs, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\nto decongestants in the past should let his or her physi-cian know before these drugs or any similar drugs areprescribed. The physician should also be told about anyallergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-stances.\nPREGNANCY. In studies of laboratory animals, some\ndecongestants have had unwanted effects on fetuses.However, it is not known whether such effects also occurin people. Women who are pregnant or who plan tobecome pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore taking decongestants.\nBREASTFEEDING. Some decongestants pass into\nbreast milk and may have unwanted effects on nursingbabies whose mothers take the drugs. Women who arebreastfeeding should check with their physicians beforeusing decongestants. If they need to take the medicine, itmay be necessary to bottle feed the baby with formulawhile taking it.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Anyone with heart\nor blood vessel disease, high blood pressure, diabetes,enlarged prostate , or overactive thyroid should not take\ndecongestants unless under a physician’s supervision.The medicine can increase blood sugar in people withdiabetes. It can be especially dangerous in people withhigh blood pressure, as it may increase blood pressure.\nBefore using decongestants, people with any of\nthese medical problems should make sure their physi-cians are aware of their conditions:\n• glaucoma• history of mental illness\nDecongestants may have a variety of side effects,\nand may also interact with other medications the patientis taking.\nSide effects\nDECONGESTANT NASAL SPRAYS AND NOSE DROPS.\nThe most common side effects from decongestant nasal\nsprays and nose drops are sneezing and temporary burn-ing, stinging, or dryness. These effects are usually tem-porary and do not need medical attention. If any of thefollowing side effects occur after using a decongestantnasal spray or nose drops, stop using the medicine imme-diately and call the physician:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1011Decongestants• increased blood pressure\n•headache\n• fast, slow, or fluttery heartbeat\n• nervousness\n•dizziness\n• nausea\n• sleep problems\nDECONGESTANTS TAKEN BY MOUTH. The most\ncommon side effects of decongestants taken by mouthare nervousness, restlessness, excitability, dizziness,drowsiness, headache, nausea, weakness, and sleep prob-lems. Anyone who has these symptoms while takingdecongestants should stop taking them immediately.\nPatients who have these symptoms while taking\ndecongestants should call the physician immediately:\n• increased blood pressure\n• fast, irregular, or fluttery heartbeat\n• severe headache• tightness or discomfort in the chest• breathing problems\n• fear or anxiety\n•hallucinations\n• trembling or shaking• convulsions (seizures)\n• pale skin\n• painful or difficult urination\nOther side effects may occur. Anyone who has\nunusual symptoms after taking a decongestant should getin touch with his or her physician.\nInteractions with other medicines\nDecongestants may interact with a variety of other\nmedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects maybe greater. Do not take decongestants at the same time asthese drugs:\n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such\nas phenzeline (Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate),used to treat conditions including depression andParkinson’s disease . Do not take decongestants at the\nsame time as a MAO inhibitor or within two weeks ofstopping treatment with an MAO inhibitor unless aphysician approves.\n• Other products containing the same or other deconges-\ntants.• Caffeine.\nIn addition, anyone who takes decongestants should\nlet the physician know all other medicines he or she istaking. Among the drugs that may interact with decon-gestants are:\n• tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil)\nor desipramine (Norpramin)\n• the antidepressant maprotiline (Ludiomil)\n• amantadine (Symmetrel)\n• amphetamines\n• medicine to relieve asthma or other breathing problems\n• methylphenidate (Ritalin)• appetite suppressants\n• other medicine for colds, sinus problems, hay fever or\nother allergies\n• beta-blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propra-\nnolol (Inderal)\n• digitalis glycosides, used to treat heart conditions\nThe list above does not include every drug that may\ninteract with decongestants. Be sure to check with aphysician or pharmacist before combining decongestantswith any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.\nDescription\nDecongestants are sold in many forms, including\ntablets, capsules, caplets, gelcaps, liqui-caps, liquids,nasal sprays, and nose drops. These drugs are sometimescombined with other medicines in cold and allergy prod-ucts designed to relieve several symptoms. Some decon-gestant products require a physician’s prescription, butthere are also many nonprescription (over-the-counter)products. Ask a physician or pharmacist about choosingan appropriate decongestant.\nCommonly used decongestants include oxymetazo-\nline (Afrin and other brands) and pseudoephedrine(Sudafed, Actifed, and other brands). The decongestantoxymetazoline is also used in some eye drops to relieveredness and itching .\nThe recommended dosage depends on the drug.\nCheck with the physician who prescribed the drug or thepharmacist who filled the prescription for the correctdosage, and always take the medicine exactly as directed.If using nonprescription (over-the-counter) types, followthe directions on the package label or ask a pharmacistfor assistance. Never take larger or more frequent doses,and do not take the drug for longer than directed.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1012DecongestantsRisks\nAnyone considering taking a decongestant should\ntake a close look at the labels of any already in their med-icine cabinet. In 2000, the Food and Drug Administrationprohibited over-the-counter sales of medicines contain-ing the decongestant phenylpropanolamine. The medi-cine is associated with an increased risk of stroke in peo-\nple ages 18 to 49, especially women. Many cold reme-dies contained this medicine. Contact a pharmacist ifthere is any question about the ingredients in a medica-tion. Over-the-counter remedies containing phenyl-propanolamine should be discarded.\nNormal results\nThe desired result when taking decongestants is the\nshort-term relief of nasal congestion.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\n“An Ingredient Under Fire: Drugmakers are Jittery After an\nFDA Panel Ruling.” Newsweek (October 30, 2000): 59.\nHenderson, Charles W. “V oluntary Withdrawal of Cold and\nAllergy Products Announced.” Medical Letter on the CDC\nand FDA (November 26, 2000).\nOTHER\n“Medline Plus Health Information”.

    "title": "Deep vein thrombosis",
    "content": "Deep vein thrombosis\nDefinition\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a\nmajor vein, usually in the legs and/or pelvis.KEY TERMS\nFetus —A developing baby inside the womb.\nHallucination —A false or distorted perception of\nobjects, sounds, or events that seems real. Hallu-cinations usually result from drugs or mental dis-orders.Description\nDeep vein thrombosis is a common but difficult to\ndetect illness that can be fatal if not treated effectively.According to the American Heart Association, more thantwo million Americans develop deep vein thrombosisannually. An estimated 600,000 of these develop pul-\nmonary embolism , a potentially fatal complication\nwhere the blood clots break off and form pulmonaryemboli, plugs that block the lung arteries. Sixty thousandpeople die of pulmonary embolism each year. Deep vein\nthrombosis is also called venous thromboembolism,thrombophlebitis or phlebothrombosis.\nDeep vein thrombosis is a major complication in\npatients who have had orthopedic surgery or pelvic,\nabdominal, or thoracic surgery . Patients with cancer\nand other chronic illnesses (including congestive heart\nfailure ), as well as those who have suffered a recent\nmyocardial infarction, are also at high risk for develop-ing DVT. Deep vein thrombosis can be chronic, withrecurrent episodes.\nCauses and symptoms\nDeep vein thrombosis is caused by blood clots in\nblood vessels that form in veins where blood flow issluggish or has been disturbed, in pockets in the calf’sdeep veins, or in veins that have been traumatized.Symptoms include swelling and tenderness of the calf orthigh, and possibly warmth. Only 23–50% of patientsexperience symptoms, so it’s often “silent.” Some indi-viduals and families have underlying clotting tendenciesthat can be tested for.\nDiagnosis\nDeep vein thrombosis can be detected through\nvenography and radionuclide venography, Doppler\nultrasonography , and impedance plethysmography.\nVenography is the most accurate test, but it is not usedmuch, because it is often painful, expensive, exposesthe patient to radiation, and can cause reactions andcomplications. Venography identifies the location,extent, and degree of attachment of the blood clots, andenables the condition of the deep leg veins to beassessed. A contrast solution is injected into a foot veinthrough a catheter. The physician observes the move-ment of the solution through the vein with a fluoro-scope while a series of x rays are taken. Venographytakes 30–45 minutes and can be done in a physician’soffice, a laboratory, or a hospital. Radionuclide venog-raphy, in which a radioactive isotope is injected, isoccasionally used, especially if a patient has had reac-tions to contrast solutions.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1013Deep vein thrombosisKEY TERMS\nPulmonary embolism —An obstruction of a blood\nvessel in the lungs, usually caused by a blood clotthat blocks a coronary artery. Pulmonary embolismcan be very serious and, in some cases, fatal.\nThrombosis —The development of a blood clot\ninside a blood vessel.\nDoppler ultrasonography is usually the preferred\nprocedure for detecting deep vein thrombosis. This tech-nique uses sound waves to measure blood flow throughleg veins and arteries. A blood pressure cuff is wrappedaround the patient’s ankle and a transducer with gel on itis placed over pulse points of the foot and lower leg.High-frequency sounds bounce off the soft tissue, andthe echoes are converted into images on a monitor. It isvery accurate in detecting clots above the knee that canbecome pulmonary embolisms. Usually performed in aphysician’s office or hospital outpatient diagnostic cen-ter, Doppler ultrasound usually takes 30–45 minutes.\nImpedance plethysmography records changes in\nblood volume and vessel resistance. A blood pressurecuff is wrapped around the leg above the knee, four elec-trodes are placed near the knee and the ankle, and thecuff is inflated. How efficiently the veins return to nor-mal is measured. Performed in a physician’s office, ittakes about 15 minutes.Treatment\nDeep vein thrombosis can be treated with drug ther-\napy, bed rest, and gradient elastic stockings. Medicationsinclude anticoagulants that “thin” blood to prevent fur-ther growth of blood clots, as well as clot-dissolvingdrugs. Heparin is a common injectable anticoagulant,and is usually followed by coumadin tablets for at leastthree months. Bed rest with the patient’s legs elevated isnecessary until the condition improves. Gradient elasticstockings should then be worn, and standing for longperiods of time avoided. In some cases, a filter is placedin the major vein (the inferior vena cava) to trap embolior clots before they get to the heart and lungs.\nAlternative treatment\nDeep vein thrombosis can be life-threatening and\nmust be treated with conventional medical therapies.However, there are alternative therapies that can be usedin conjunction with emergency treatments to dissolve theclot that help support the body and prevent recurrence. Atrained alternative health care practitioner should be con-sulted due to the severity of this condition.\nPrognosis\nIn many cases, deep vein thrombosis can be success-\nfully treated if diagnosed early.\nPrevention\nDeep vein thrombosis can be prevented through pro-\nphylactic anticoagulant drugs and venous stasis preventionwith gradient elastic stockings and intermittent pneumaticcompression of the legs. High-risk patients often need toremain on anticoagulants like Coumadin indefinitely.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDeBakey, Michael E., and Antonio M.

    "title": "Defibrillation",
    "content": "Defibrillation\nDefinition\nDefibrillation is a process in which an electronic\ndevice sends an electric shock to the heart to stop anextremely rapid, irregular heartbeat, and restore the nor-mal heart rhythm.\nPurpose\nDefibrillation is performed to correct life-threaten-\ning fibrillations of the heart, which could result in car-diac arrest. It should be performed immediately afteridentifying that the patient is experiencing a cardiacemergency, has no pulse, and is unresponsive.\nPrecautions\nDefibrillation should not be performed on a patient\nwho has a pulse or is alert, as this could cause a lethalheart rhythm disturbance or cardiac arrest. The paddlesused in the procedure should not be placed on a woman’sbreasts or over a pacemaker.\nDescription\nFibrillations cause the heart to stop pumping blood,\nleading to brain damage and/or cardiac arrest. About10% of the ability to restart the heart is lost with everyminute that the heart stays in fibrillation. Death can\noccur in minutes unless the normal heart rhythm isrestored through defibrillation. Because immediatedefibrillation is crucial to the patient’s survival, theAmerican Heart Association has called for the integra-tion of defibrillation into an effective emergency cardiaccare system. The system should include early access,early cardiopulmonary resuscitation , early defibrilla-\ntion, and early advanced cardiac care.\nDefibrillators deliver a brief electric shock to the\nheart, which enables the heart’s natural pacemaker toregain control and establish a normal heart rhythm. Thedefibrillator is an electronic device with electrocardio-gram leads and paddles. During defibrillation, the pad-dles are placed on the patient’s chest, caregivers standback, and the electric shock is delivered. The patient’spulse and heart rhythm are continually monitored. Med-ications to treat possible causes of the abnormal heartrhythm may be administered. Defibrillation continuesuntil the patient’s condition stabilizes or the procedure isordered to be discontinued.\nEarly defibrillators, about the size and weight of a\ncar battery, were used primarily in ambulances and hos-pitals. The American Heart Association now advocatespublic access defibrillation; this calls for placing auto-mated external defibrillators (AEDS) in police vehicles,airplanes, and at public events, etc. The AEDS are small-er, lighter, less expensive, and easier to use than the earlydefibrillators. They are computerized to provide simple,verbal instructions to the operator and to make it impos-sible to deliver a shock to a patient whose heart is not fib-rillating. The placement of AEDs is likely to expand tomany public locations.\nPreparation\nAfter help is called for, cardiopulmonary resuscita-\ntion ( CPR ) is begun and continued until the caregivers\narrive and set up the defibrillator.

The caregivers verify lackof a pulse, and select a charge.\nAftercare\nAfter defibrillation, the patient’s cardiac status, breath-\ning, and vital signs are monitored until he or she is stable.Typically, this monitoring takes place after the patient hasbeen removed to an intensive care or cardiac care unit in ahospital. An electrocardiogram and chest x ray are taken.\nThe patient’s skin is cleansed to remove gel or paste, and, ifnecessary, ointment is applied to burns . An intravenous\nline provides additional medication, as needed.\nRisks\nSkin burns from the defibrillator paddles are the\nmost common complication of defibrillation.

    "title": "Dehydration",
    "content": "Dehydration\nDefinition\nDehydration is the loss of water and salts essential\nfor normal body function.\nDescription\nDehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid\nthan it takes in. This condition can result from illness; ahot, dry climate; prolonged exposure to sun or high tem-peratures; not drinking enough water; and overuse ofdiuretics or other medications that increase urination.\nDehydration can upset the delicate fluid-salt balanceneeded to maintain healthy cells and tissues.\nWater accounts for about 60% of a man’s body\nweight. It represents about 50% of a woman’s weight.Young and middle-aged adults who drink when they’rethirsty do not generally have to do anything more tomaintain their body’s fluid balance. Children need morewater because they expend more energy, but most chil-dren who drink when they are thirsty get as much wateras their systems require.\nAge and dehydration\nAdults over the age of 60 who drink only when they\nare thirsty probably get only about 90% of the fluid theyneed. Developing a habit of drinking only in response tothe body’s thirst signals raises an older person’s risk ofbecoming dehydrated. Seniors who have relocated toareas where the weather is warmer or dryer than the cli-mate they are accustomed to are even likelier to becomedehydrated unless they make it a practice to drink evenwhen they are not thirsty.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1016DehydrationDehydration in children usually results from losing\nlarge amounts of fluid and not drinking enough water toreplace the loss. This condition generally occurs in chil-dren who have stomach flu characterized by vomitingand diarrhea , or who can not or will not take enough\nfluids to compensate for excessive losses associated withfever and sweating of acute illness. An infant can\nbecome dehydrated only hours after becoming ill. Dehy-dration is a major cause of infant illness and death\nthroughout the world.\nTypes of dehydration\nMild dehydration is the loss of no more than 5% of\nthe body’s fluid. Loss of 5–10% is considered moderatedehydration. Severe dehydration (loss of 10–15% ofbody fluids) is a life-threatening condition that requiresimmediate medical care.\nComplications of dehydration\nWhen the body’s fluid supply is severely depleted,\nhypovolemic shock is likely to occur. This condition,\nwhich is also called physical collapse, is characterized bypale, cool, clammy skin; rapid heartbeat; and shallowbreathing.\nBlood pressure sometimes drops so low it can not be\nmeasured, and skin at the knees and elbows may becomeblotchy. Anxiety , restlessness, and thirst increase. After\nthe patient’s temperature reaches 107°F (41.7°C) damageto the brain and other vital organs occurs quickly.\nCauses and symptoms\nStrenuous activity, excessive sweating, high fever,\nand prolonged vomiting or diarrhea are common causesof dehydration. So are staying in the sun too long, notdrinking enough fluids, and visiting or moving to a warmregion where it doesn’t often rain. Alcohol, caffeine , and\ndiuretics or other medications that increase the amount offluid excreted can cause dehydration.\nReduced fluid intake can be a result of:\n• appetite loss associated with acute illness\n• excessive urination (polyuria)\n• nausea\n• bacterial or viral infection or inflammation of the phar-\nynx (pharyngitis)\n• inflammation of the mouth caused by illness, infection,\nirritation, or vitamin deficiency ( stomatitis )\nOther conditions that can lead to dehydration include:• disease of the adrenal glands, which regulate the body’s\nwater and salt balance and the function of many organsystems\n• diabetes mellitus• eating disorders\n• kidney disease\n• chronic lung disease\nAn infant who does not wet a diaper in an eight-\nhour period is dehydrated. The soft spot on the baby’shead (fontanel) may be depressed. Symptoms of dehy-dration at any age include cracked lips, dry or stickymouth, lethargy, and sunken eyes. A person who isdehydrated cries without shedding tears and does noturinate very often. The skin is less elastic than it shouldbe and is slow to return to its normal position afterbeing pinched.\nDehydration can cause confusion, constipation , dis-\ncomfort, drowsiness, fever, and thirst. The skin turns paleand cold, the mucous membranes lining the mouth andnose lose their natural moisture. The pulse sometimesraces and breathing becomes rapid. Significant fluid losscan cause serious neurological problems.\nDiagnosis\nThe patient’s symptoms and medical history usual-\nly suggest dehydration. Physical examination may\nreveal shock, rapid heart rate, and/or low blood pres-sure. Laboratory tests, including blood tests (to checkelectrolyte levels) and urine tests (e.g., urine specificgravity and creatinine), are used to evaluate the severi-ty of the problem. Other laboratory tests may beordered to determine the underlying condition (such asdiabetes or an adrenal gland disorder) causing thedehydration.\nTreatment\nIncreased fluid intake and replacement of lost elec-\ntrolytes are usually sufficient to restore fluid balances inpatients who are mildly or moderately dehydrated. Forindividuals who are mildly dehydrated, just drinkingplain water may be all the treatment that is needed.Adults who need to replace lost electrolytes may drinksports beverages (e.g., Gatorade or Recharge) or con-sume a little additional salt. Parents should follow labelinstructions when giving children Pedialyte or othercommercial products recommended to relieve dehydra-tion. Children who are dehydrated should receive onlyclear fluids for the first 24 hours.\nA child who is vomiting should sip one or two tea-\nspoons of liquid every 10 minutes. A child who is less\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1017DehydrationKEY TERMS\nElectrolytes —Mineral salts, such as sodium and\npotassium, dissolved in body fluid.than a year old and who is not vomiting should be given\none tablespoon of liquid every 20 minutes. A child whois more than one year old and who is not vomiting shouldtake two tablespoons of liquid every 30 minutes. A babywho is being breast-fed should be given clear liquids fortwo consecutive feedings before breastfeeding isresumed. A bottle-fed baby should be given formuladiluted to half its strength for the first 24 hours afterdeveloping symptoms of dehydration.\nIn order to accurately calculate fluid loss, it’s\nimportant to chart weight changes every day and keep arecord of how many times a patient vomits or has diar-rhea. Parents should note how many times a baby’s dia-per must be changed.\nChildren and adults can gradually return to their\nnormal diet after they have stopped vomiting and nolonger have diarrhea. Bland foods should be reintro-duced first, with other foods added as the digestive sys-tem is able to tolerate them. Milk, ice cream, cheese,and butter should not be eaten until 72 hours after symp-toms have disappeared.\nMedical care\nSevere dehydration can require hospitalization and\nintravenous fluid replacement. If an individual’s bloodpressure drops enough to cause or threaten the develop-ment of shock, medical treatment is usually required. Adoctor should be notified whenever an infant or childexhibits signs of dehydration or a parent is concernedthat a stomach virus or other acute illness may lead todehydration.\nA doctor should also be notified if:\n• a child less than three months old develops a fever\nhigher than 100°F (37.8°C)\n• a child more than three months old develops a fever\nhigher than 102°F (38.9°C)\n• symptoms of dehydration worsen\n• an individual urinates very sparingly or does not urinate\nat all during a six-hour period\n• dizziness, listlessness, or excessive thirst occur• a person who is dieting and using diuretics loses more\nthan 3 lb (1.3 kg) in a day or more than 5 lb (2.3 kg) aweek\nWhen treating dehydration, the underlying cause\nmust also be addressed. For example, if dehydration iscaused by vomiting or diarrhea, medications may be pre-scribed to resolve these symptoms. Patients who aredehydrated due to diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenalgland disorders must receive treatment for these condi-tions as well as for the resulting dehydration.Alternative treatment\nGelatin water can be substituted for electrolyte-\nreplacement solutions. It is made by diluting a 3-ozpackage in a quart of water or by adding one-quarterteaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar to a pint ofwater.\nPrognosis\nMild dehydration rarely results in complications. If\nthe cause is eliminated and lost fluid is replaced, milddehydration can usually be cured in 24–48 hours.\nV omiting and diarrhea that continue for several days\nwithout adequate fluid replacement can be fatal. The riskof life-threatening complications is greater for youngchildren and the elderly. However, dehydration that israpidly recognized and treated has a good outcome.\nPrevention\nPatients who are vomiting or who have diarrhea\ncan prevent dehydration by drinking enough fluid fortheir urine to remain the color of pale straw. Ensuringthat patients always drink adequate fluids during an ill-ness will help prevent dehydration. Infants and youngchildren with diarrhea and vomiting can be given elec-trolyte solutions such as Pedialyte to help prevent dehy-dration. People who are not ill can maintain properfluid balance by drinking several glasses of waterbefore going outside on a hot day. It is also a good ideato avoid coffee and tea, which increase body tempera-ture and water loss.\nPatients should know whether any medication they\nare taking can cause dehydration and should get promptmedical care to correct any underlying condition thatincreases the risk of dehydration.\nOther methods of preventing dehydration and ensur-\ning adequate fluid intake include:\n• eating more soup at mealtime• drinking plenty of water and juice at mealtime and\nbetween meals\n• keeping a glass of water nearby when working or relax-\ning\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1018DehydrationResources\nBOOKS\nLarson, David, E., ed.

After initial expo-sure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys-tem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Boththese immune agents respond when the body is reex-posed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulatingproteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termedan immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cells’ respons-es occur over several days, and are thus called delayedhypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat-ed by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red-ness (erythema) at the injection site.\nA DHT is performed for one of three reasons:\n• To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber-\nculosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting\ninto the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con-tains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provokean immune response.\n• To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants,\nsuch as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually doneby placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con-taining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub-stances.\n• To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of\nthe evaluation of immune system health in infection,cancer , immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen-\ning, aging , and malnutrition . DHT can help predict\nsurvival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu-ate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens usedfor these tests must be ones the patient has beenexposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivatedantigens from common infectious agents to which thepatient might have been exposed, such as mumps ,\nCandida albicans ,tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a\nskin fungus).\nPrecautions\nNo special precautions are necessary for most\npatients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certainskin irritants should alert the clinician performing thetest. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigenscontain mercury, a source of irritation to somepatients.\nDescription\nThe most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in\nwhich a small amount of TB antigen is injected intothe skin. The area is examined 48–72 hours after theinjection.\nIn the patch test, 20–30 adhesive patches are usually\nplaced on the upper back. The patches are kept in placeand the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches arethen removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after-ward, and possibly again a day or more following that.Patch testing is usually performed following a patientcomplaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance.Testing may suggest several candidates; identifying theright one requires careful review of the patient’s possi-ble exposure.\nThe test of overall T cell responsiveness is per-\nformed with several injections. Each area injected is cir-cled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after theinjection.\nPreparation\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1019Delayed hypersensitivity skin testAftercare\nPatches should be kept dry. Injection sites may be\nwashed, but excessive rubbing should be avoided. Patch-es and injection sites may become reddened or irritated.If a patch causes severe itching or discomfort, the patient\nshould remove it immediately.\nRisks\nDHT is quite safe for virtually all people. There is\nno risk of infection from the agents injected, since theyare purified antigens, not whole organisms. Life threaten-ing, hypersensitive reactions ( anaphylaxis ) are a very\nsmall risk; patients should notify the administeringphysician immediately if signs of wheezing , swelling, or\ndiffuse redness of the skin develops.\nNormal results\nAbsence of exposure to TB is indicated by absent or\nvery little skin reaction; redness or hardness smaller than5 mm (about 0.25 in) is considered normal for a personnot exposed or infected with TB.\nPatch test sites should be normal or only slightly red.\nT cell responsiveness tests should be positive; that is,\nthe injected areas should be reddened and hard. Two affect-ed areas of 2 mm or more is considered a positive result.\nAbnormal results\nTB exposure is indicated by a reaction of 10 mm or\nmore. The degree of redness is not important. A 5–10mm area could indicate exposure if there is an underlyingrisk to TB.\nPatch test areas that become reddened and irritated\nindicate reaction to the substance in the patch.KEY TERMS\nAllergen —A foreign substance that provokes an\nimmune reaction in some sensitive people but notin most others.\nAnaphylaxis —An exaggerated, life-threatening\nhypersensitivity reaction to a previously encoun-tered antigen.\nAntibody —An immune system protein made to\nfight infection.\nAntigen —A foreign substance detected that pro-\nvokes an immune reaction.Absence of any reaction to injected areas indi-\ncates lack of T cell responsiveness, a condition calledanergy. T cell anergy is seen in immune deficiencydiseases including AIDS , some cases of infectious\ndiseases, malignancies, immunosuppressive therapy(including corticosteroid treatment), some autoim-mune diseases, malnutrition, major surgery, and someviral immunizations.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDavies, R., and S.

    "title": "Delirium",
    "content": "Delirium\nDefinition\nDelirium is a state of mental confusion that develops\nquickly and usually fluctuates in intensity.\nDescription\nDelirium is a syndrome, or group of symptoms,\ncaused by a disturbance in the normal functioning of thebrain. The delirious patient has a reduced awareness ofand responsiveness to the environment, which may bemanifested as disorientation, incoherence, and memorydisturbance. Delirium is often marked by hallucinations ,\ndelusions , and a dream-like state.\nDelirium affects at least one in 10 hospitalized\npatients, and is a common part of many terminal illness-es. Delirium is more common in the elderly than in thegeneral population. While it is not a specific diseaseitself, patients with delirium usually fare worse thanthose with the same illness who do not have delirium.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThere are a large number of possible causes of delir-\nium. Metabolic disorders are the single most commoncause, accounting for 20–40% of all cases. This type ofdelirium, termed “metabolic encephalopathy,” may resultfrom organ failure, including liver or kidney failure.Other metabolic causes include diabetes mellitus ,\nhyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism , vitamin defi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1020Deliriumciencies, and imbalances of fluids and electrolytes in the\nblood.

Medicinal drugs with deliriumas a possible side effect or result of overdose include:\n• anticholinergics, including atropine, scopolamine,\nchlorpromazine (an antipsychotic), and diphenhy-dramine (an antihistamine)\n• sedatives, including barbiturates ,benzodiazepines ,\nand ethanol (drinking alcohol)\n• antidepressant drugs\n• anticonvulsant drugs\n• nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),\nincluding ibuprofen and acetaminophen\n• corticosteroids, including prednisone\n• anticancer drugs, including methotrexate and procar-\nbazine\n• lithium\n• cimetidine\n• antibiotics\n• L-dopa\nDelirium may result from ingestion of legal or ille-\ngal psychoactive drugs, including:\n• ethanol (drinking alcohol)\n• marijuana\n•L S D  ( lysergic acid diethylamide ) and other hallucino-\ngens\n• amphetamines• cocaine\n• opiates, including heroin and morphine\n• PCP (phencyclidine)\n• inhalants\nDrug withdrawal may also cause delirium. Delirium\ntremens, or “DTs,” may occur during alcohol withdrawalafter prolonged or intense consumption. Withdrawalsymptoms are also possible from many of the psychoac-tive prescription drugs.\nPoisons may cause delirium (“toxic encephalopa-\nthy”), including:\n• solvents, such as gasoline, kerosene, turpentine, ben-\nzene, and alcohols\n• carbon monoxide\n• refrigerants (Freon)KEY TERMS\nDementia —A loss of mental ability severe enough\nto interfere with functioning.

Delirium symptoms typicallyfluctuate through the day, with periods of relative calmand lucidity alternating with periods of florid delirium.The hallmark of delirium is a fluctuating level of con-sciousness. Symptoms may include:\n• decreased awareness of the environment• confusion or disorientation, especially of time• memory impairment, especially of recent events• hallucinations• illusions and misinterpreted stimuli• increased or decreased activity level\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1021Delirium• mood disturbance, possibly including anxiety , eupho-\nria or depression\n• language or speech impairment\nDiagnosis\nDelirium is diagnosed through the medical history\nand recognition of symptoms during mental status\nexamination . The most important part of diagnosis is\ndetermining the cause of the delirium. Tests may includeblood and urine analysis for levels of drugs, fluids, elec-trolytes, and blood gases, and to test for infection; lum-bar puncture (“spinal tap”) to test for central nervoussystem infection; x ray, computed tomography scans\n(CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to\nlook for tumors, hemorrhage, or other brain abnormali-ty; thyroid tests; electroencephalography (EEG); elec-\ntrocardiography (ECG); and possibly others as dictated\nby the likely cause.\nTreatment\nTreatment of delirium begins with recognizing and\ntreating the underlying cause. Delirium itself is managedby reducing disturbing stimuli, or providing soothingones; use of simple, clear language in communication;and reassurance, especially from family members. Physi-cal restraints may be needed if the patient is a danger tohimself or others, or if he insists on removing necessarymedical equipment such as intravenous lines or monitors.Sedatives or antipsychotic drugs may be used to reduce\nanxiety, hallucinations, and delusions.\nPrognosis\nPersons with delirium usually have a worse prog-\nnosis for the underlying disease than the person with-out delirium. Nonetheless, those without terminal ill-ness usually recover from delirium. They may not,however, regain all their original cognitive abilities,and may be left with some permanent impairments,including fatigue , irritability, difficulty concentrating,\nor mood changes.\nPrevention\nPrevention of delirium is focused on treating or\navoiding its underlying causes. The most preventableforms are those induced by drugs. Strategies for reducingdelirium include following prescriptions, consulting theprescribing physician immediately if symptoms occur,and consulting the physician before discontinuing thedrug, even if it has been ineffective; avoiding intoxica-tion with legal or illegal drugs, and seeking professionalassistance before suddenly discontinuing an addictive\ndrug such as alcohol or heroin; maintaining good nutri-\ntion, which promotes general health and can minimize\nthe likelihood of delirium from alcohol intoxication andwithdrawal; and avoiding exposure to solvents, insecti-cides, heavy metals, or biological poisons in the home orworkplace.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGuze, Samuel, ed.

    "title": "Delusions",
    "content": "Delusions\nDefinition\nA delusion is an unshakable belief in something\nuntrue. These irrational beliefs defy normal reasoning,and remain firm even when overwhelming proof is pre-sented to dispute them. Delusions are often accompaniedby hallucinations and/or feelings of paranoia , which\nact to strengthen confidence in the delusion. Delusionsare distinct from culturally or religiously based beliefsthat may be seen as untrue by outsiders.\nDescription\nDelusions are a common symptom of several mood\nand personality-related mental illnesses, includingschizoaffective disorder ,schizophrenia , shared psy-\nchotic disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar\ndisorder . They are also the major feature of delusional\ndisorder. Individuals with delusional disorder sufferfrom long-term, complex delusions that fall into one ofsix categories: persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, ero-tomanic, somatic, or mixed. There are also delusionaldisorders such as dementia that clearly have organic or\nphysical causes.\nPersecutory\nIndividuals with persecutory delusional disorder are\nplagued by feelings of paranoia and an irrational yetunshakable belief that someone is plotting against them,or out to harm them.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1022DelusionsGrandiose\nIndividuals with grandiose delusional disorder have\nan over-inflated sense of self-worth. Their delusions cen-ter on their own importance, such as believing that theyhave done or created something of extreme value or havea “special mission.”\nJealousy\nJealous delusions are unjustified and irrational\nbeliefs that an individual’s spouse or significant other hasbeen unfaithful.\nErotomanic\nIndividuals with erotomanic delusional disorder\nbelieve that another person, often a stranger, is in lovewith them. The object of their affection is typically of ahigher social status, sometimes a celebrity. This type ofdelusional disorder may lead to stalking or other poten-tially dangerous behavior.\nSomatic\nSomatic delusions involve the belief that something\nis physically wrong with the individual. The delusionmay involve a medical condition or illness or a perceiveddeformity. This condition differs from hypochondriasis\nin that the deformity is perceived as a fixed condition nota temporary illness.\nMixed\nMixed delusions are those characterized by two or\nmore of persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, erotomanic, orsomatic themes.\nCauses and symptoms\nSome studies have indicated that delusions may be\ngenerated by abnormalities in the limbic system, the por-tion of the brain on the inner edge of the cerebral cortexthat is believed to regulate emotions. The exact source ofdelusions has not been conclusively found, but potentialcauses include genetics, neurological abnormalities, andchanges in brain chemistry. Delusions are also a knownpossible side effect of drug use and abuse (e.g., ampheta-mines, cocaine , PCP).\nDiagnosis\nPatients with delusional symptoms should undergo a\nthorough physical examination and patient history to\nrule out possible organic causes (such as dementia). If apsychological cause is suspected, a mental health profes-sional will typically conduct an interview with theKEY TERMS\nHallucinations —False or distorted sensory experi-\nences that appear to be real perceptions.\nParanoia —An unfounded or exaggerated distrust\nof others.\nShared psychotic disorder —Also known as folie à\ndeux; shared psychotic disorder is an uncommondisorder in which the same delusion is shared bytwo or more individuals.\npatient and administer one of several clinical inventories,\nor tests, to evaluate mental status.\nTreatment\nDelusions that are symptomatic of delusional disor-\nder should be treated by a psychologist and/or psychia-trist. Though antipsychotic drugs are often not effec-\ntive, antipsychotic medication such as thioridazine (Mel-laril), haloperidol (Haldol), chlorpromazine (Thorazine),clozapine (Clozaril), or risperidone (Risperdal) may beprescribed, and cognitive therapy or psychotherapy maybe attempted.\nIf an underlying condition such as schizophrenia,\ndepression, or drug abuse is found to be triggering thedelusions, an appropriate course of medication and/orpsychosocial therapy is employed to treat the primarydisorder. The medication, typically, will include anantipsychotic agent.\nPrognosis\nDelusional disorder is typically a chronic condition,\nbut with appropriate treatment, a remission of delusionalsymptoms occurs in up to 50% of patients. However,because of their strong belief in the reality of their delu-sions and a lack of insight into their condition, individualswith this disorder may never seek treatment, or may beresistant to exploring their condition in psychotherapy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

    "title": "Dementia",
    "content": "Dementia\nDefinition\nDementia is a loss of mental ability severe enough to\ninterfere with normal activities of daily living, lastingmore than six months, not present since birth, and notassociated with a loss or alteration of consciousness.\nDescription\nDementia is a group of symptoms caused by gradual\ndeath of brain cells. The loss of cognitive abilities that\noccurs with dementia leads to impairments in memory,reasoning, planning, and personality. While the over-whelming number of people with dementia are elderly, itis not an inevitable part of aging . Instead, dementia is\ncaused by specific brain diseases. Alzheimer’s disease\n(AD) is the most common cause, followed by vascular ormulti-infarct dementia.\nThe prevalence of dementia has been difficult to\ndetermine, partly because of differences in definitionamong different studies, and partly because there is somenormal decline in functional ability with age. Dementiaaffects 5–8% of all people between ages 65 and 74, andup to 20% of those between 75 and 84. Estimates fordementia in those 85 and over range from 30–47%.Between two and four million Americans have AD; thatnumber is expected to grow to as many as 14 million bythe middle of the twenty-first century as the populationas a whole ages.\nThe cost of dementia can be considerable. While\nmost people with dementia are retired and do not sufferincome losses from their disease, the cost of care is oftenenormous. Financial burdens include lost wages for fam-ily caregivers, medical supplies and drugs, and homemodifications to ensure safety. Nursing home care maycost several thousand dollars a month or more. The psy-chological cost is not as easily quantifiable but can beeven more profound. The person with dementia losescontrol of many of the essential features of his life andpersonality, and loved ones lose a family member even asthey continue to cope with the burdens of increasingdependence and unpredictability.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nDementia is usually caused by degeneration in the\ncerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible forthoughts, memories, actions and personality. Death ofbrain cells in this region leads to the cognitive impair-ment which characterizes dementia.\nThe most common cause of dementia is AD,\naccounting for half to three quarters of all cases. Thebrain of a person with AD becomes clogged with twoabnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles andsenile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted massesof protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. Senileplaques are composed of parts of neurons surrounding agroup of proteins called beta-amyloid deposits. Whythese structures develop is unknown. Current researchindicates possible roles for inflammation, blood flowrestriction, and toxic molecular fragments known as freeradicals. Several genes have been associated with higherincidences of AD, although the exact role of these genesis still unknown.\nVascular dementia is estimated to cause from 5–30%\nof all dementias. It occurs from decrease in blood flow tothe brain, most commonly due to a series of small strokes(multi-infarct dementia). Other cerebrovascular causesinclude: vasculitis from syphilis ,Lyme disease , or sys-\ntemic lupus erythematosus ; subdural hematoma ; and\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage . Because of the usually sud-\nden nature of its cause, the symptoms of vascular demen-tia tend to begin more abruptly than those of Alzheimer’sdementia. Symptoms may progress stepwise with theoccurrence of new strokes. Unlike AD, the incidence ofvascular dementia is lower after age 75.\nOther conditions which may cause dementia\ninclude:\n• AIDS• Parkinson’s disease\n• Lewy body disease\n• Pick’s disease\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1024Dementia• Huntington’s disease\n• Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease• brain tumor\n•hydrocephalus\n• head trauma• multiple sclerosis• prolonged abuse of alcohol or other drugs\n• vitamin deficiency: thiamin, niacin, or B\n12\n• hypothyroidism\n• hypercalcemia\nSymptoms\nDementia is marked by a gradual impoverishment of\nthought and other mental activities. Losses eventuallyaffect virtually every aspect of mental life. The slow pro-gression of dementia is in contrast with delirium , which\ninvolves some of the same symptoms, but has a veryrapid onset and fluctuating course with alteration in thelevel of consciousness. However, delirium may occurwith dementia, especially since the person with dementiais more susceptible to the delirium-inducing effects ofmay types of drugs.\nSymptoms include :\n• Memory losses. Memory loss is usually the first symp-\ntom noticed. It may begin with misplacing valuablessuch as a wallet or car keys, then progress to forgettingappointments, where the car was left, and the routehome, for instance. More profound losses follow, suchas forgetting the names and faces of family members.\n• Impaired abstraction and planning. The person with\ndementia may lose the ability to perform familiar tasks, toplan activities, and to draw simple conclusions from facts.\n• Language and comprehension disturbances. The person\nmay be unable to understand instructions, or follow thelogic of moderately complex sentences. Later, he or shemay not understand his or her own sentences, and havedifficulty forming thoughts into words.\n• Poor judgment. The person may not recognize the con-\nsequences of his or her actions or be able to evaluate theappropriateness of behavior. Behavior may become rib-ald, overly-friendly, or aggressive. Personal hygienemay be ignored.\n• Impaired orientation ability. The person may not be\nable to identify the time of day, even from obviousvisual clues; or may not recognize his or her location,even if familiar. This disability may stem partly fromlosses of memory and partly from impaired abstraction.• Decreased attention and increased restlessness. This\nmay cause the person with dementia to begin an activityand quickly lose interest, and to wander frequently.Wandering may cause significant safety problems, whencombined with disorientation and memory losses. Theperson may begin to cook something on the stove, thenbecome distracted and wander away while it is cooking.\n• Personality changes and psychosis . The person may\nlose interest in once-pleasurable activities, and becomemore passive, depressed, or anxious. Delusions , suspi-\ncion, paranoia , and hallucinations may occur later in\nthe disease. Sleep disturbances may occur, includinginsomnia and sleep interruptions.\nDiagnosis\nSince dementia usually progresses slowly, diagnos-\ning it in its early stages can be difficult. Several officevisits over several months or more may be needed. Diag-nosis begins with a thorough physical exam and com-plete medical history, usually including comments fromfamily members or caregivers. A family history of eitherAD or cerebrovascular disease may provide clues to thecause of symptoms. Simple tests of mental function,including word recall, object naming, and number-sym-bol matching, are used to track changes in the person’scognitive ability.\nDepression is common in the elderly and can be\nmistaken for dementia; therefore, ruling out depression isan important part of the diagnosis. Distinguishingdementia from the mild normal cognitive decline ofadvanced age is also critical. The medical historyincludes a complete listing of drugs being taken, since anumber of drugs can cause dementia-like symptoms.\nDetermining the cause of dementia may require a\nvariety of medical tests, chosen to match the most likelyetiology. Cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, andtumors may be diagnosed with x-rays, CT or MRI scans,and vascular imaging studies. Blood tests may revealnutritional deficiencies or hormone imbalances.\nTreatment\nTreatment of dementia begins with treatment of\nthe underlying disease, where possible. The underlyingcauses of nutritional, hormonal, tumor-caused anddrug-related dementias may be reversible to someextent. Treatment for stroke-related dementia beginsby minimizing the risk of further strokes, throughsmoking cessation, aspirin therapy, and treatment of\nhypertension , for instance. There are no therapies that\ncan reverse the progression of AD. Aspirin, estrogen,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1025Dementiavitamin E, and selegiline are currently being evaluated\nfor their ability to slow the rate of progression.\nCare for a person with dementia can be difficult and\ncomplex. The patient must learn to cope with functionaland cognitive limitations, while family members or othercaregivers assume increasing responsibility for the per-son’s physical needs. In progressive dementias such asAD, the person may ultimately become completelydependent. Education of the patient and family early onin the disease progression can help them anticipate andplan for inevitable changes.\nSymptoms of dementia may be treated with a com-\nbination of psychotherapy, environmental modifications,and medication. Drug therapy can be complicated by for-getfulness, especially if the prescribed drug must betaken several times daily.\nBehavioral approaches may be used to reduce the\nfrequency or severity of problem behaviors, such asaggression or socially inappropriate conduct. Problembehavior may be a reaction to frustration or overstimula-tion; understanding and modifying the situations thattrigger it can be effective. Strategies may include break-ing down complex tasks, such as dressing or feeding,into simpler steps, or reducing the amount of activity inthe environment to avoid confusion and agitation. Plea-surable activities, such as crafts, games, and music, canprovide therapeutic stimulation and improve mood.\nModifying the environment can increase safety and\ncomfort while decreasing agitation. Home modificationsfor safety include removal or lock-up of hazards such assharp knives, dangerous chemicals, and tools. Child-proof latches or Dutch doors may be used to limit accessas well. Lowering the hot water temperature to 120°F(48.9°C) or less reduces the risk of scalding. Bed railsand bathroom safety rails can be important safety mea-sures, as well. Confusion may be reduced with simplerdecorative schemes and presence of familiar objects.Covering or disguising doors (with a mural, for example)may reduce the tendency to wander. Positioning the bedin view of the bathroom can decrease incontinence.\nTwo drugs, tacrine (Cognex) and donepezil (Ari-\ncept), are commonly prescribed for AD. These drugsinhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine in the brain, pro-longing its ability to conduct chemical messages betweenbrain cells. They provide temporary improvement in cog-nitive functions for about 40% of patients with mild tomoderate AD. Hydergine is sometimes prescribed aswell, though it is of questionable benefit for mostpatients.\nPsychotic symptoms, including paranoia, delusions,\nand hallucinations, may be treated with antipsychotic\ndrugs , such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone,and clozapine. Side effects of these drugs can be signifi-\ncant. Antianxiety drugs such as Valium may improve\nbehavioral symptoms, especially agitation and anxiety ,\nalthough BuSpar has fewer side effects. The anticonvul-sant carbamazepine is also sometimes prescribed for agi-tation. Depression is treated with antidepressants, usuallybeginning with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n(SSRIs) such as Prozac or Paxil, followed bymonoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepres-\nsants. Electroconvulsive therapy may be appropriate for\nsome patients with severe depression who are unrespon-sive to drug therapy. In general, medications should beadministered very cautiously to demented patients, in thelowest possible effective doses, to minimize side effects.Supervision of taking medications is generally required.\nLong-term institutional care may be needed for the\nperson with dementia, as profound cognitive losses oftenprecede death by a number of years. Early planning forthe financial burden of nursing home care is critical. Use-ful information about financial planning for long-termcare is available through the Alzheimer’s Association.\nFamily members or others caring for a person with\ndementia are often subject to extreme stress , and may\ndevelop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt, and hopeless-ness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for their loved oneand for themselves. Depression is an extremely commonconsequence of being a full-time caregiver for a personwith dementia. Support groups can be an important wayto deal with the stress of caregiving. The location andcontact numbers for caregiver support groups are avail-able from the Alzheimer’s Association; they may also beavailable through a local social service agency or thepatient’s physician. Medical treatment for depression maybe an important adjunct to group support.\nAlternative treatment\nSeveral drugs are currently being tested for their\nability to slow the progress of AD. These includeacetyl-l-carnitine, which acts on the cellular energystructures known as mitochondria; propentofylline,which may aid circulation; milameline, which acts sim-ilarly to tacrine and donezepil; and ginkgo extract.\nGinkgo extract, derived from the leaves of the Gink-\ngo biloba tree, interferes with a circulatory protein called\nplatelet activating factor. It also increases circulation andoxygenation to the brain. Ginkgo extract has been usedfor many years in China and is widely prescribed inEurope for treatment of circulatory problems. A 1997study of patients with dementia seemed to show thatgingko extract could improve their symptoms, though thestudy was criticized for certain flaws in its method.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1026DementiaPrognosis\nThe prognosis for dementia depends on the underly-\ning disease. On average, people with Alzheimer’s diseaselive eight years past their diagnosis, with a range fromone to 20 years. Vascular dementia is usually progressive,with death from stroke , infection, or heart disease.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent Alzheimer’s dis-\nease, although several of the drugs under investigationmay reduce its risk or slow its progression. The risk ofdeveloping multi-infarct dementia may be reduced byreducing the risk of stroke.\nResources\nBOOKS\nJacques, Alan. Understanding Dementia.

    "title": "Dengue fever",
    "content": "Dengue fever\nDefinition\nDengue fever is a disease caused by one of a number\nof viruses that are carried by mosquitoes. These mosqui-toes then transmit the virus to humans.\nDescription\nThe virus that causes dengue fever is called an\narbovirus, which stands for arthropod-borne virus. Mos-quitoes are a type of arthropod. In a number of regions,mosquitoes carry this virus and are responsible for pass-ing it along to humans. These regions include the MiddleEast, the far East, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands. Inthese locations, the dengue fever arbovirus is endemic,meaning that the virus naturally and consistently lives inthat location. The disease only shows up in the UnitedStates sporadically.\nIn order to understand how dengue fever is transmit-\nted, several terms need to be defined. The word “host”means an animal (including a human) that can be infect-ed with a particular disease. The word “vector” means anorganism that can carry a particular disease-causingagent (like a virus or bacteria) without actually develop-ing the disease. The vector can then pass the virus or bac-teria on to a new host.\nMany of the common illnesses in the United States\n(including the common cold , many viral causes of diar-\nrhea , and influenza or “flu”) are spread because the\nviruses that cause these illness can be passed directlyfrom person to person. However, dengue fever cannot bepassed directly from one infected person to another.Instead, the virus responsible for dengue fever requiresan intermediate vector, a mosquito, that carries the virusfrom one host to another. The mosquito that carries thearbovirus responsible for dengue fever is the same typeof mosquito that can transmit other diseases, includingyellow fever . This mosquito is called Aedes egypti . The\nmost common victims are children younger than 10 yearsof age.\nCauses and symptoms\nDengue fever can occur when a mosquito carrying\nthe arbovirus bites a human, passing the virus on to thenew host. Once in the body, the virus travels to variousglands where it multiplies. The virus can then enter the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1027Dengue feverbloodstream. The presence of the virus within the blood\nvessels, especially those feeding the skin, causes changesto these blood vessels. The vessels swell and leak. Thespleen and lymph nodes become enlarged, and patches ofliver tissue die. A process called disseminated intravascu-lar coagulation (DIC) occurs, where chemicals responsi-ble for clotting are used up and lead to a risk of severebleeding (hemorrhage).\nAfter the virus has been transmitted to the human\nhost, a period of incubation occurs. During this time (last-ing about five to eight days) the virus multiplies. Symp-toms of the disease appear suddenly and include highfever , chills, headache , eye pain , red eyes, enlarged\nlymph nodes, a red flush to the face, lower back pain,extreme weakness, and severe aches in the legs and joints.\nThis initial period of illness lasts about two–three\ndays. After this time, the fever drops rapidly and thepatient sweats heavily. After about a day of feeling rela-tively well, the patient’s temperature increases again,although not as much as the first time. A rash of smallred bumps begins on the arms and legs, spreading to thechest, abdomen, and back. It rarely affects the face. Thepalms of the hands and the soles of the feet becomeswollen and turn bright red. The characteristic combina-tion of fever, rash, and headache are called the “denguetriad.” Most people recover fully from dengue fever,although weakness and fatigue may last for several\nweeks. Once a person has been infected with denguefever, his or her immune system keeps producing cellsthat prevent reinfection for about a year.\nMore severe illness may occur in some people.\nThese people may be experiencing dengue fever for thefirst time. However, in some cases a person may havealready had dengue fever at one time, recovered, andthen is reinfected with the virus. In these cases, the firstinfection teaches the immune system to recognize thepresence of the arbovirus. When the immune cellsencounter the virus during later infections, the immunesystem over-reacts. These types of illnesses, calleddengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syn-drome (DSS), involve more severe symptoms. Fever andheadache are the first symptoms, but the other initialsymptoms of dengue fever are absent. The patient devel-ops a cough , followed by the appearance of small pur-\nplish spots (petechiae) on the skin. These petechiae areareas where blood is leaking out of the vessels. Largebruised areas appear as the bleeding worsens and abdom-inal pain may be severe. The patient may begin to vomita substance that looks like coffee grounds. This is actual-ly a sign of bleeding into the stomach. As the blood ves-sels become more damaged, they leak more and continueto increase in diameter (dilate), causing a decrease inblood flow to all tissues of the body. This state of lowblood flow is called shock. Shock can result in damage to\nthe body’s organs (especially the heart and kidneys)because low blood flow deprives them of oxygen.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis should be suspected in endemic areas when-\never a high fever goes on for two to seven days, especially ifaccompanied by a bleeding tendency. Symptoms of shockshould suggest the progression of the disease to DSS.\nThe arbovirus causing dengue fever is one of the few\ntypes of arbovirus that can be isolated from the serum ofthe blood. The serum is the fluid in which blood cells aresuspended. Serum can be tested because the phase inwhich the virus travels throughout the bloodstream islonger in dengue fever than in other arboviral infections.A number of tests are used to look for reactions betweenthe patient’s serum and laboratory-produced antibodies.Antibodies are special cells that recognize the markers(or antigens) present on invading organisms. Duringthese tests, antibodies are added to a sample of thepatient’s serum. Healthcare workers then look for reac-tions that would only occur if viral antigens were presentin that serum.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment available to shorten the course\nof dengue fever, DHF, or DSS. Medications can be givento lower the fever and to decrease the pain of muscleaches and headaches. Fluids are given through a needlein a vein to prevent dehydration . Blood transfusions\nmay be necessary if severe hemorrhaging occurs. Oxy-gen should be administered to patients in shock.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for uncomplicated dengue fever is\nvery good, and almost 100% of patients fully recover.However, as many as 6–30% of all patients die whenDHF occurs. The death rate is especially high among the\nyoungest patients (under one year old). In places whereexcellent medical care is available, very close monitoringand immediate treatment of complications lowers thedeath rate among DHF and DSS patients to about 1%.\nPrevention\nPrevention of dengue fever means decreasing the\nmosquito population. Any sources of standing water(buckets, vases, etc.) where the mosquitoes can breedmust be eliminated. Mosquito repellant is recommendedfor those areas where dengue fever is endemic. To helpbreak the cycle of transmission, sick patients should be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1028Dengue feverplaced in bed nets so that mosquitoes cannot bite them\nand become arboviral vectors.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDouglas, R.

    "title": "Dental trauma",
    "content": "Dental trauma\nDefinition\nDental trauma is injury to the mouth, including\nteeth, lips, gums, tongue, and jawbones. The most com-mon dental trauma is a broken or lost tooth.KEY TERMS\nEndemic —Naturally and consistently present in a\ncertain geographical region.\nHost—The organism (such as a monkey or human)\nin which another organism (such as a virus or bac-teria) is living.\nVector —A carrier organism (such as a fly or mos-\nquito) that delivers a virus (or other agent of infec-tion) to a host.Description\nDental trauma may be inflicted in a number of ways:\ncontact sports, motor vehicle accidents, fights, falls, eat-ing hard foods, drinking hot liquids, and other suchmishaps. As oral tissues are highly sensitive, injuries tothe mouth are typically very painful. Dental traumashould receive prompt treatment from a dentist.\nCauses and symptoms\nSoft tissue injuries, such as a “fat lip,” a burned\ntongue, or a cut inside the cheek, are characterized bypain , redness, and swelling with or without bleeding. A\nbroken tooth often has a sharp edge that may cut thetongue and cheek. Depending on the position of the frac-ture, the tooth may or may not cause toothache pain.\nWhen a tooth is knocked out (evulsed), the socket isswollen, painful, and bloody. A jawbone may be brokenif the upper and lower teeth no longer fit together proper-ly (malocclusion ), or if the jaws have pain with limited\nability to open and close (mobility), especially aroundthe temporomandibular joint (TMJ).\nDiagnosis\nDental trauma is readily apparent upon examination.\nDental x rays may be taken to determine the extent of thedamage to broken teeth. More comprehensive x rays areneeded to diagnose a broken jaw.\nTreatment\nSoft tissue injuries may require only cold compress-\nes to reduce swelling. Bleeding may be controlled withdirect pressure applied with clean gauze. Deep lacera-tions and punctures may require stitches. Pain may bemanaged with aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol,\nAspirin Free Excedrin) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil).\nTreatment of a broken tooth will vary depending on\nthe severity of the fracture. For immediate first aid, theinjured tooth and surrounding area should be rinsed gen-tly with warm water to remove dirt, then covered with acold compress to reduce swelling and ease pain. A dentistshould examine the injury as soon as possible. Any piecesfrom the broken tooth should be saved and brought along.\nIf a piece of the outer tooth has chipped off, but the\ninner core (pulp) is undisturbed, the dentist may simplysmooth the rough edges or replace the missing sectionwith a small composite filling. In some cases, a fragmentof broken tooth may be bonded back into place. Ifenough tooth is missing to compromise the entire toothstructure, but the pulp is not permanently damaged, thetooth will require a protective coverage with a gold or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1029Dental traumaKEY TERMS\nCrown —1 The natural part of the tooth covered by\nenamel. 2 A restorative crown is a protective shellthat fits over a tooth.\nEruption —The process of a tooth breaking through\nthe gum tissue to grow into place in the mouth.\nEvulsion —The forceful, and usually accidental,\nremoval of a tooth from its socket in the bone.\nExtraction —The surgical removal of a tooth from\nits socket in the bone.\nMalocclusion —A problem in the way the upper\nand lower teeth fit together in biting or chewing.\nPulp—The soft innermost layer of a tooth contain-\ning blood vessels and nerves.\nRoot canal treatment —The process of removing\ndiseased or damaged pulp from a tooth, then fill-ing and sealing the pulp chamber and root canals.\nTemporomandibular joint (TMJ) —The jaw joint\nformed by the mandible (lower jaw bone) movingagainst the temporal (temple and side) bone of theskull.porcelain crown. If the pulp has been seriously damaged,\nthe tooth will require root canal treatment before it\nreceives a crown. A tooth that is vertically fractured orfractured below the gumline will require root canal treat-ment and protective restoration. A tooth which no longerhas enough remaining structure to retain a crown mayhave to be extracted (surgically removed).\nWhen a permanent tooth has been knocked out, it\nmay be saved with prompt action. The tooth must befound immediately after it has been lost. It should bepicked up by the natural crown (the top part covered byhard enamel). It must not be handled by the root. If thetooth is dirty, it may be gently rinsed under runningwater. It should never be scrubbed, and it should never bewashed with soap, toothpaste, mouthwash, or otherchemicals. The tooth should not be dried or wrapped in atissue or cloth. It must be kept moist at all times.\nThe tooth may be placed in a clean container of\nmilk, cool water with or without a pinch of salt, or insaliva. If possible, the patient and the tooth should bebrought to the dentist within 30 minutes of the toothloss. Rapid action improves the chances of successfulre-implantation; however, it is possible to save a toothafter 30 minutes, if the tooth has been kept moist andhandled properly.\nThe body usually rejects re-implantation of a prima-\nry (baby) tooth. In this case, the empty socket is treatedas a soft tissue injury and monitored until the permanenttooth erupts.\nA broken jaw must be set back into its proper posi-\ntion and stabilized with wires while it heals. Healing maytake six weeks or longer, depending on the patient’s ageand the severity of the fracture.\nAlternative treatment\nThere is no substitute for treatment by a dentist or\nother medical professional. There are, however, homeo-pathic remedies and herbs that can be used simultaneous-ly with dental care and throughout the healing process.Homeopathic arnica ( Arnica montana ) should be taken as\nsoon as possible after the injury to help the body deal withthe trauma. Repeating a dose several times daily for theduration of healing is also useful. Homeopathic hyper-icum ( Hypericum perforatum ) can be taken if nerve pain\nis involved, especially with a tooth extraction or root\ncanal. Homeopathic comfrey ( Symphytum officinale) may\nbe helpful in treating pain due to broken jaw bones, butshould only be used after the bones have been reset. Cal-endula ( Calendula officinalis ) and plantain ( Plantago\nmajor ) can be used as a mouth rinse to enhance tissue\nhealing. These herbs should not be used with deep lacera-tions that need to heal from the inside first.Prognosis\nWhen dental trauma receives timely attention and\nproper treatment, the prognosis for healing is good. Aswith other types of trauma, infection may be a complica-tion, but a course of antibiotics is generally effective.\nPrevention\nMost dental trauma is preventable. Car seat belts\nshould always be worn, and young children should besecured in appropriate car seats. Homes should be moni-tored for potential tripping and slipping hazards. Child-proofing measures should be taken, especially for tod-dlers. In addition to placing gates across stairs andpadding sharp table edges, electrical cords should betucked away. Young children may receive severe oralburns from gnawing on live power cords.\nEveryone who participates in contact sports should\nwear a mouthguard to avoid dental trauma. Athletes infootball, ice hockey, wrestling, and boxing commonlywear mouthguards. The mandatory use of mouthguardsin football prevents about 200,000 oral injuries annually.Mouthguards should also be worn along with helmets innoncontact sports such as skateboarding, in-line skating,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1030Dental traumaand bicycling. An athlete who does not wear a mouth-\nguard is 60 times more likely to sustain dental traumathan one who does. Any activity involving speed, anincreased chance of falling, and potential contact with ahard piece of equipment has the likelihood of dental trau-ma that may be prevented or substantially reduced inseverity with the use of mouthguards.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. 211 East Chicago\nAve., Ste. 700, Chicago, IL 60611-2616.

Depo-Provera is also a hormone, but is administeredby intramuscular injection and provides protection againstpregnancy for three months. Lunelle is another injectable\ncontraceptive that is administered monthly (every 28 to 30days); it was approved by the Food and Drug Administra-tion (FDA) in October 2000. The hormone in Norplant andDepo-Provera is progestin, a synthetic hormone similar toone found naturally in a woman’s body; Lunelle containsthe hormones progestin and estrogen.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of these hormones is to prevent preg-\nnancy; they are about 99% effective in achieving thisgoal. No hormonal contraceptive methods provide protec-tion from AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases .\nDepo-Provera and Lunelle are given as an injection\nand work in several ways to prevent conception. First,the egg (ovum) is prevented from maturing and beingreleased. The mucus in the cervix (opening into theuterus or womb) becomes thicker, making it difficult forthe sperm to enter. Depo-Provera and Lunelle also causethe lining of the uterus to become thinner, makingimplantation of a fertilized egg unlikely.\nAn injection of Depo-Provera or Lunelle must be\ngiven within the first five days of a normal period. Depo-Provera provides protection against pregnancy for threemonths, while Lunelle provides similar protection forone month. Ovulation (release of a mature egg) typicallyoccurs within 60 days of the last injection of Lunelle,about twice as fast after use of Depo-Provera. Also,because Lunelle is a combined hormone contraceptive asopposed to progestin-only Depo-Provera and Norplant, itis less likely to cause irregular or absent menstruation.\nNorplant capsules contain a synthetic hormone that\nis slowly released over a period of up to five years. Itfunctions like Depo-Provera in that it prevents theovaries from producing ova (eggs) and also results inthicker mucus in the cervix, which prevents the spermfrom passing through the cervix. Norplant can be insert-ed at any time.\nPreparation\nThe woman being considered for Depo-Provera or\nLunelle will have a pelvic and breast examination, a Pap\ntest (a microscopic examination of cell samples taken\nfrom the cervix), blood pressure check, weight check,and a review of her medical history. Women who havediabetes mellitus , major depression, blood clotting\nproblems, liver disease, or weight problems should usethese methods only under strict medical supervision.Depo-Provera or Lunelle should not be used if thewoman is pregnant, has unexplained vaginal bleeding,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1031Depo-Provera/Norplant\nA physician inserts a contraceptive implant under the skin\nof a woman’s arm. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by\npermission.)suffers from severe liver disease, has breast cancer ,o r\nhas a history of blood clots or stroke .\nIndividuals who select Norplant will receive the\nsame basic physical examination . If approved for this\nmethod, a site of implantation will be selected (usuallythe inside of the upper arm), and the area prepared forminor surgery. The skin will be washed with soap andwater, and an antiseptic, such as iodine solution, will beapplied. The physician will use a local anesthetic tonumb the area, a small incision will be made, the sixNorplant capsules will be inserted, and the incision sewnup (sutured). Protection against pregnancy normallybegins within 24 hours. If necessary, the implants can beremoved in 15–20 minutes. Norplant should not be usedby women who are pregnant, have blood clotting prob-lems, or have unexplained vaginal bleeding. Advantagesinclude light periods with less cramping and decreasedanemia. This form of birth control may also be protectiveagainst endometrial cancer .\nBecause Depo-Provera and Norplant use only the\nhormone progestin, they may provide an alternative forwomen who can not use estrogen-containing birth con-trol pills. One benefit of Lunelle, however, is that itseffects wear off more quickly than Depo-Provera, animportant factor in the event that a woman has seriousside effects or wants to become pregnant.\nRisks\nThe most common side effects associated with\nDepo-Provera and Lunelle are yellowing of the skin,headache , nervousness, dizziness , abdominal pain , hair\nloss, rash, increase in the number of migraine headaches,increased or decreased interest in sexual intercourse, thedevelopment of dark spots on the skin, depression, andweakness. Danger signs that need to reported immediate-ly include weight gain, heavy vaginal bleeding, frequenturination, blurred vision, fainting , severe abdominal\npain, and coughing up blood. Because the effects ofDepo-Provera may last up to 12 weeks, it may take alonger time for women trying to conceive to becomepregnant after discontinuing the injections.KEY TERMS\nHormone —A chemical produced in a gland or\norgan and transported by the blood to another areaof the body where it produces a specific effect.\nPap test —A microscopic examination of cell sam-\nples taken from the cervix.The main reactions to Norplant include headache,\nweight gain, irregular periods or no period at all, breasttenderness, acne , gain or loss of facial hair, color\nchanges of the skin over the area of insertion, and ovari-\nan cysts . The doctor should be notified immediately of\nlumps in the breast, heavy vaginal bleeding, yellowing ofthe skin or eyes, or infection of the incision. Women whouse Norplant are discouraged from smoking .\nNormal results\nThese hormone contraceptive methods normally\nresult in a success rate of 99%.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDickason, Elizabeth Jean, Bonnie Lang Silverman, and Judith\nA.

    "content": "Depressive disorders\nDefinition\nDepression or depressive disorders (unipolar depres-\nsion) are mental illnesses characterized by a profoundand persistent feeling of sadness or despair and/or a lossof interest in things that were once pleasurable. Distur-bance in sleep, appetite, and mental processes are a com-mon accompaniment.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1032Depressive disordersDescription\nEveryone experiences feelings of unhappiness and\nsadness occasionally. But when these depressed feel-ings start to dominate everyday life and cause physicaland mental deterioration, they become what are knownas depressive disorders. Each year in the UnitedStates, depressive disorders affect an estimated 17million people at an approximate annual direct andindirect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is like-ly to experience an episode of severe depression in herlifetime, with a 10–20% lifetime prevalence, com-pared to 5–10% for men. The average age a firstdepressive episode occurs is in the mid-20s, althoughthe disorder strikes all age groups indiscriminately,from children to the elderly.\nThere are two main categories of depressive disor-\nders: major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.Major depressive disorder is a moderate to severeepisode of depression lasting two or more weeks. Indi-viduals experiencing this major depressive episode mayhave trouble sleeping, lose interest in activities they oncetook pleasure in, experience a change in weight, have dif-ficulty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, orhave a preoccupation with death or suicide. In children,\nthe major depression may appear as irritability.\nWhile major depressive episodes may be acute\n(intense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongo-ing, chronic depression that lasts two or more years (oneor more years in children) and has an average duration of16 years. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymicdisorder may rise and fall in intensity, and those afflictedwith the disorder may experience some periods of nor-mal, non-depressed mood of up to two months in length.Its onset is gradual, and dysthymic patients may not beable to pinpoint exactly when they started feelingdepressed. Individuals with dysthymic disorder mayexperience a change in sleeping and eating patterns, lowself-esteem, fatigue , trouble concentrating, and feelings\nof hopelessness.\nDepression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n\naffective mental illness that causes radical emotionalchanges and mood swings, from manic highs to depres-sive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experiencealternating episodes of mania and depression.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes behind depression are complex and not\nyet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu-rotransmitters—the chemicals in the brain that transmitmessages between nerve cell— is believed to be key todepression, external factors such as upbringing (more soin dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor-tant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is\nabused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles-cence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinkingmay emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depressionmay follow.\nHeredity does seem to play a role in who develops\ndepressive disorders. Individuals with major depressionin their immediate family are up to three times morelikely to have the disorder themselves. It would seemthat biological and genetic factors may make certainindividuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor-ders, but environmental circumstances may often trig-ger the disorder.\nExternal stressors and significant life changes, such\nas chronic medical problems, death of a loved one,divorce or estrangement, miscarriage , or loss of a job,\ncan also result in a form of depression known as adjust-ment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorderusually resolve themselves, occasionally they mayevolve into a major depressive disorder.\nMajor depressive episode\nIndividuals experiencing a major depressive episode\nhave a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest orpleasure in activities. Children experiencing a majordepressive episode may appear or feel irritable ratherthan depressed. In addition, five or more of the followingsymptoms will occur on an almost daily basis for a peri-od of at least two weeks:\n• Significant change in weight.\n•Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep).\n• Psychomotor agitation or retardation.\n• Fatigue or loss of energy.\n• Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt.\n• Diminished ability to think or to concentrate, or indeci-\nsiveness.\n• Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal and/or suicide\nattempts.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1033Depressive disorders\nSigns Of Mental Depression\nDepressed mood\nLack of interest or pleasure in daily activitiesSignificant weight loss (without dieting) or weight gainDifficulty sleeping or excessive sleepingLoss of energyFeelings of worthlessness or guiltDifficulty in making decisionsRestlessnessRecurrent thoughts of deathDysthymic disorder\nDysthymia commonly occurs in tandem with other\npsychiatric and physical conditions. Up to 70% of dys-thymic patients have both dysthymic disorder and majordepressive disorder, known as double depression. Sub-stance abuse, panic disorders, personality disorders ,\nsocial phobias , and other psychiatric conditions are also\nfound in many dysthymic patients. Dysthymia is prevalentin patients with certain medical conditions, including mul-\ntiple sclerosis ,AIDS ,hypothyroidism ,chronic fatigue\nsyndrome ,Parkinson’s disease , diabetes, and post-car-\ndiac transplantation. The connection between dysthymicdisorder and these medical conditions is unclear, but itmay be related to the way the medical condition and/or itspharmacological treatment affects neurotransmitters. Dys-thymic disorder can lengthen or complicate the recoveryof patients also suffering from medical conditions.Along with an underlying feeling of depression,\npeople with dysthymic disorder experience two or moreof the following symptoms on an almost daily basis for aperiod for two or more years (most suffer for five years),or one year or more for children:\n• under or overeating\n• insomnia or hypersomnia\n• low energy or fatigue\n• low self-esteem\n• poor concentration or trouble making decisions\n• feelings of hopelessness\nDiagnosis\nIn addition to an interview, several clinical invento-\nries or scales may be used to assess a patient’s mentalstatus and determine the presence of depressive symp-toms. Among these tests are: the Hamilton DepressionScale (HAM-D), Child Depression Inventory (CDI),Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck DepressionInventory (BDI), and the Zung Self-Rating Scale forDepression. These tests may be administered in an out-patient or hospital setting by a general practitioner, socialworker, psychiatrist, or psychologist.\nTreatment\nMajor depressive and dysthymic disorders are typi-\ncally treated with antidepressants or psychosocial thera-py. Psychosocial therapy focuses on the personal andinterpersonal issues behind depression, while antidepres-sant medication is prescribed to provide more immediaterelief for the symptoms of the disorder. When usedtogether correctly, therapy and antidepressants are apowerful treatment plan for the depressed patient.\nAntidepressants\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\nsuch as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft) reducedepression by increasing levels of serotonin, a neuro-transmitter. Some clinicians prefer SSRIs for treatmentof dysthymic disorder. Anxiety ,diarrhea , drowsiness,\nheadache , sweating, nausea, poor sexual functioning,\nand insomnia are all possible side effects of SSRIs.\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are less expensive\nthan SSRIs, but have more severe side-effects, which mayinclude persistent dry mouth ,sedation ,dizziness , and\ncardiac arrhythmias . Because of these side effects, cau-\ntion is taken when prescribing TCAs to elderly patients.TCAs include amitriptyline (Elavil), imipramine (Tofra-nil), and nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor). A 10-day sup-ply of TCAs can be lethal if ingested all at once, so these\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1034Depressive disordersSubgenual \nprefrontal cortex\nNormal\nAbnormalSubgenual \nprefrontal cortex\nRecent scientific research has indicated that the size of the\nsubgenual prefrontal cortex of the brain (located behind thebridge of the nose) may be a determining factor in heredi-tary depressive disorders. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators\nGroup.)drugs may not be a preferred treatment option for patients\nat risk for suicide.\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS) such as\ntranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine (Nardil) blockthe action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme inthe central nervous system. Patients taking MAOIs mustcut foods high in tyramine (found in aged cheeses andmeats) out of their diet to avoid potentially serioushypertensive side effects.\nHeterocyclics include bupropion (Wellbutrin) and tra-\nzodone (Desyrel). Bupropion should not be prescribed topatients with a seizure disorder . Side effects of the drug\nmay include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, drymouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, low bloodpressure, and insomnia. Because trazodone has a sedativeeffect, it is useful in treating depressed patients with insom-nia. Other possible side effects of trazodone include drymouth, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and headache.\nPsychosocial therapy\nPsychotherapy explores an individual’s life to bring\nto light possible contributing causes of the presentdepression. During treatment, the therapist helps thepatient to become self-aware of his or her thinking pat-terns and how they came to be. There are several differ-ent subtypes of psychotherapy, but all have the commongoal of helping the patient develop healthy problem solv-ing and coping skills.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy assumes that the\npatient’s faulty thinking is causing the current depressionand focuses on changing the depressed patient’s thoughtpatterns and perceptions. The therapist helps the patientidentify negative or distorted thought patterns and theemotions and behavior that accompany them, and thenretrains the depressed individual to recognize the think-ing and react differently to it.\nElectroconvulsant therapy\nECT, or electroconvulsive therapy , is usually\nemployed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatmentoptions have been explored. However, it is sometimes usedearly in treatment when severe depression is present andthe patient refuses oral medication, or when the patient isbecoming dehydrated, extremely suicidal, or psychotic.\nThe treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses\nthat move into the brain through electrodes on thepatient’s head. ECT is given under general anesthesiaand patients are administered a muscle relaxant to pre-vent convulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behindthe success of ECT therapy are not known, it is believedthat the electrical current modifies the electrochemicalprocesses of the brain, consequently relieving depres-\nsion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confusionare possible side effects immediately following an ECTprocedure. Memory loss, typically transient, has alsobeen reported in ECT patients.\nAlternative treatment\nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum ) is used\nthroughout Europe to treat depressive symptoms. Unliketraditional prescription antidepressants, this herbal anti-depressant has few reported side effects. Some users mayexperience high blood pressure, headaches, stiff neck,nausea, and vomiting. As of early 1998, United States.clinical trials organized by the National Institute of Men-tal Health were still in the planning phase. Its efficacy insevere depression is very uncertain.\nHomeopathic treatment can also be very therapuetic\nin treating depression. Good nutrition , proper sleep,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1035Depressive disorders\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scans comparing a\nnormal brain with that of someone with a depressed mentaldisorder. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)exercise , and full engagement in life are very important\nto a healthy mental state.\nPrognosis\nUntreated or improperly treated depression is the\nnumber one cause of suicide in the United States. Propertreatment relieves symptoms in 80–90% of depressedpatients. After each major depressive episode, the risk ofrecurrence climbs significantly—50% after one episode,70% after two episodes, and 90% after three episodes.For this reason, patients need to be aware of the symp-toms of recurring depression and may require long-termmaintenance treatment of antidepressants and/or therapy.\nPrevention\nPatient education in the form of therapy or self-help\ngroups is crucial for training patients with depressive dis-orders to recognize symptoms of depression and to takean active part in their treatment program. Extended main-tenance treatment with antidepressants may be requiredin some patients to prevent relapse. Early interventionwith children with depression is effective in arrestingdevelopment of more severe problems.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

    "title": "Dermatitis",
    "content": "Dermatitis\nDefinition\nDermatitis is a general term used to describe inflam-\nmation of the skin.\nDescription\nMost types of dermatitis are characterized by an\nitchy pink or red rash.\nContact dermatitis is an allergic reaction to some-\nthing that irritates the skin and is manifested by one ormore lines of red, swollen, blistered skin that may itch or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1036Dermatitisseep. It usually appears within 48 hours after touching or\nbrushing against a substance to which the skin is sensitive.The condition is more common in adults than in children.\nContact dermatitis can occur on any part of the body,\nbut it usually affects the hands, feet, and groin. Contactdermatitis usually does not spread from one person toanother, nor does it spread beyond the area exposed tothe irritant unless affected skin comes into contact withanother part of the body. However, in the case of someirritants, such as poison ivy, contact dermatitis can bepassed to another person or to another part of the body.\nStasis dermatitis is characterized by scaly, greasy\nlooking skin on the lower legs and around the ankles. Sta-sis dermatitis is most apt to affect the inner side of the calf.\nNummular dermatitis, which is also called nummular\neczematous dermatitis or nummular eczema, generallyaffects the hands, arms, legs, and buttocks of men andwomen older than 55 years of age. This stubborninflamed rash forms circular, sometimes itchy, patchesand is characterized by flares and periods of inactivity.\nAtopic dermatitis is characterized by itching , scal-\ning, swelling, and sometimes blistering. In early child-hood it is called infantile eczema and is characterized byredness, oozing, and crusting. It is usually found on theface, inside the elbows, and behind the knees.\nSeborrheic dermatitis may be dry or moist and is\ncharacterized by greasy scales and yellowish crusts on thescalp, eyelids, face, external surfaces of the ears, under-arms, breasts, and groin. In infants it is called “cradle cap.”\nCauses and symptoms\nAllergic reactions are genetically determined, and\ndifferent substances cause contact dermatitis to developin different people. A reaction to resin produced by poi-son ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac is the most com-mon source of symptoms. It is, in fact, the most commonallergy in this country, affecting one of every two peoplein the United States.\nFlowers, herbs, and vegetables can also affect the\nskin of some people. Burns and sunburn increase the\nrisk of dermatitis developing, and chemical irritants thatcan cause the condition include:\n• chlorine\n• cleansers• detergents and soaps• fabric softeners\n• glues used on artificial nails\n• perfumes\n• topical medicationsContact dermatitis can develop when the first con-\ntact occurs or after years of use or exposure.\nStasis dermatitis, a consequence of poor circulation,\noccurs when leg veins can no longer return blood to theheart as efficiently as they once did. When that happens,fluid collects in the lower legs and causes them to swell.Stasis dermatitis can also result in a rash that can breakdown into sores known as stasis ulcers.\nThe cause of nummular dermatitis is not known, but\nit usually occurs in cold weather and is most common inpeople who have dry skin. Hot weather and stress can\naggravate this condition, as can the following:\n•allergies\n• fabric softeners\n• soaps and detergents• wool clothing\n• bathing more than once a day\nAtopic dermatitis can be caused by allergies, asth-\nma, or stress, and there seems to be a genetic predisposi-\ntion for atopic conditions. It is sometimes caused by anallergy to nickel in jewelry.\nSeborrheic dermatitis (for which there may also be a\ngenetic predisposition) is usually caused by overproduc-tion of the oil glands. In adults it can be associated withdiabetes mellitus or gold allergy. In infants and adults it\nmay be caused by a biotin deficiency.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of dermatitis is made on the basis of\nhow the rash looks and its location. The doctor mayscrape off a small piece of affected skin for microscopicexamination or direct the patient to discontinue use of anypotential irritant that has recently come into contact with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1037Dermatitis\nDermatitis on hands and fingers. (Custom Medical Stock\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)the affected area. Two weeks after the rash disappears, the\npatient may resume use of the substances, one at a time,until the condition recurs. Eliminating the substance mostrecently added should eliminate the irritation.\nIf the origin of the irritation has still not been identi-\nfied, a dermatologist may perform one or more patch tests.This involves dabbing a small amount of a suspected irri-tant onto skin on the patient’s back. If no irritation devel-ops within a few days, another patch test is performed. Theprocess continues until the patient experiences an allergicreaction at the spot where the irritant was applied.\nTreatment\nTreating contact dermatitis begins with eliminating\nor avoiding the source of irritation. Prescription or over-the-counter corticosteroid creams can lessen inflamma-tion and relieve irritation. Creams, lotions, or ointmentsnot specifically formulated for dermatitis can intensifythe irritation. Oral antihistamines are sometimes recom-\nmended to alleviate itching, and antibiotics are pre-\nscribed if the rash becomes infected. Medications takenby mouth to relieve symptoms of dermatitis can makeskin red and scaly and cause hair loss.KEY TERMS\nAllergic reaction —An inappropriate or exaggerat-\ned genetically determined reaction to a chemicalthat occurs only on the second or subsequentexposures to the offending agent, after the firstcontact has sensitized the body.\nCorticosteriod —A group of synthetic hormones\nthat are used to prevent or reduce inflammation.Toxic effects may result from rapid withdrawal afterprolonged use or from continued use of large doses.\nPatch test —A skin test that is done to identify aller-\ngens. A suspected substance is applied to the skin.After 24–48 hours, if the area is red and swollen,the test is positive for that substance. If no reactionoccurs, another substance is applied. This is con-tinued until the patient experiences an allergicreaction where the irritant was applied to the skin.\nRash —A spotted, pink or red skin eruption that\nmay be accompanied by itching and is caused bydisease, contact with an allergen, food ingestion,or drug reaction.\nUlcer —An open sore on the skin, resulting from\ntissue destruction, that is usually accompanied byredness, pain, or infection.Patients who have a history of dermatitis should\nremove their rings before washing their hands. Theyshould use bath oils or glycerine-based soaps and bathein lukewarm saltwater.\nPatting rather than rubbing the skin after bathing and\nthoroughly massaging lubricating lotion or nonprescrip-tion cortisone creams into still-damp skin can soothe red,irritated nummular dermatitis. Highly concentrated corti-sone preparations should not be applied to the face,armpits, groin, or rectal area. Periodic medical monitoringis necessary to detect side effects in patients who use suchpreparations on rashes covering large areas of the body.\nCoal-tar salves can help relieve symptoms of num-\nmular dermatitis that have not responded to other treat-ments, but these ointments have an unpleasant odor andstain clothing.\nPatients who have stasis dermatitis should elevate\ntheir legs as often as possible and sleep with a pillowbetween the lower legs.\nTar or zinc paste may also be used to treat stasis der-\nmatitis. Because these compounds must remain in con-tact with the rash for as long as two weeks, the paste andbandages must be applied by a nurse or a doctor.\nCoal-tar shampoos may be used for seborrheic der-\nmatitis that occurs on the scalp. Sun exposure after theuse of these shampoos should be avoided because therisk of sunburn of the scalp is increased.\nAlternative treatment\nSome herbal therapies can be useful for skin condi-\ntions. Among the herbs most often recommended are:\n• Burdock root ( Arctium lappa )\n• Calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) ointment\n• Chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ) ointment\n• Cleavers ( Galium ssp.)\n• Evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis )\n• Nettles ( Urtica dioica )\nContact dermatitis can be treated botanically and\nhomeopathically. Grindelia ( Grindelia spp.) and sas-\nsafras ( Sassafras albidum ) can help when applied topi-\ncally. Determining the source of the problem and elimi-nating it is essential. Oatmeal baths are very helpful inrelieving the itch. Bentonite clay packs or any mud packdraws the fluid out, and helps dry up the lesions. Corti-sone creams are not recommended.\nStasis dermatitis should be treated by a trained prac-\ntitioner. This condition responds well to topical herbaltherapies, however, the cause must also be addressed.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1038DermatitisSelenium-based shampoos, topical applications of flax oil\nand/or olive oil, and biotin supplementation are amongthe therapies recommended for seborrheic dermatitis.\nPrognosis\nDermatitis is often chronic, but symptoms can gen-\nerally be controlled.\nPrevention\nContact dermatitis can be prevented by avoiding the\nsource of irritation. If the irritant cannot be avoided com-pletely, the patient should wear gloves and other protec-tive clothing whenever exposure is likely to occur.\nImmediately washing the exposed area with soap\nand water can stem allergic reactions to poison ivy, poi-son oak, or poison sumac, but because soaps can dry theskin, patients susceptible to dermatitis should use themonly on the face, feet, genitals, and underarms.\nClothing should be loose fitting and 100% cotton.\nNew clothing should be washed in dye-free, unscenteddetergent before being worn.\nInjury to the lower leg can cause stasis dermatitis to\nulcerate (form open sores). If stasis ulcers develop, adoctor should be notified immediately.\nYoga and other relaxation techniques may help pre-\nvent atopic dermatitis caused by stress.\nAvoidance of sweating may aid in preventing sebor-\nrheic dermatitis.\nA patient who has dermatitis should also notify a\ndoctor if any of the following occurs:\n• fever develops\n• skin oozes or other signs of infection appear\n• symptoms do not begin to subside after seven days’\ntreatment\n• he/she comes into contact with someone who has a\nwart, cold sore , or other viral skin infection\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Editors of Time-Life Books.

    "content": "DES exposure\nDefinition\nDES (diethylstilbestrol) is a hormone that was pre-\nscribed for pregnant women in the 1950s and early1960s. Many years later, doctors discovered that thedaughters of the women who received DES were at highrisk for a variety of problems, including infertility ,pre-\nmature labor , and cancer of the vagina and cervix.\nDescription\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, several drug compa-\nnies claimed that DES (diethylstilbestrol) could preventmiscarriages. DES is a synthetic hormone, related toestrogen. Since up to 20% of all pregnancies end in mis-\ncarriage , this seemed like an important breakthrough\nand DES was prescribed for many women who hadbleeding in early pregnancy . Ultimately, it was found to\nhave no effect on miscarriages and the practice of pre-scribing DES was stopped in the 1960s. Almost 10 yearslater, the daughters of women who had taken DES duringpregnancy began to develop unusual symptoms.\nDoctors discovered that when these young women\nreached their teens, they were at higher risk for a varietyof problems, including:\n• clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix• infertility\n•premature labor and other problems in pregnancy\nCauses and symptoms\nDES has affected a very specific group of women.\nThese are women who were exposed to DES in uterobefore 18 weeks of pregnancy. In other words, theirmothers must have taken DES within the first four to fivemonths of pregnancy. It is now known that the femalereproductive organs are formed during that time. DES\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1039DES exposureappears to interfere with proper growth and development\nof the uterus, cervix, vagina, and fallopian tubes.\nIn the early 1970s, there was an increase in a rare\nform of cancer, clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vaginaand cervix. Up until that time, doctors had seen thesecancers only in elderly women. Suddenly, young womenwho had the disease appeared.\nThis was so unusual that researchers studied these\nwomen to see if they had anything in common. After agreat deal of questioning and examination, it was foundthat they all had one factor in common. All of the youngwomen had been exposed to DES in utero in the earlyweeks of pregnancy.\nToday, it is difficult to imagine how shocking this\ndiscovery was. Doctors had only recently recognized thatmedications and exposure to chemicals during pregnancycould cause birth defects . This was a birth defect that\nhad gone undetected for almost two decades.\nSince then, doctors have studied DES daughters very\ncarefully. Fortunately, the risk of clear cell adenocarcino-ma is actually quite low. In fact, it appears that if a DESdaughter has not developed this cancer by age 30, shewill not develop it. Since all DES daughters are now overage 30, there should be no further cases related to DESexposure. However, there are a number of other symp-toms and problems associated with DES exposure.\n• Cervix and vagina. DES daughters often have distinc-\ntive changes of the cervix and vagina that can be seenduring a pelvic exam . These changes include a cervical\nhood (a vaginal fold draped over the cervix),cockscomb cervix (an abnormally shaped cervix), andadenosis (glandular cells normally located within thecervix that appear on the outside of the cervix and inthe vagina).KEY TERMS\nCervix —The opening at the bottom of the uterus.\nColposcopy —A special examination of the cervix\nusing a magnifying scope. This is a procedure thatcan be done in the doctor’s office.\nFallopian tubes —The tubes that carry the ovum\n(egg) from the ovary to the uterus.\nPap smear —A screening test for precancerous and\ncancerous cells on the cervix. This simple test isdone during a routine pelvic exam and involvesscraping cells from the cervix.• Fallopian tubes. Some DES daughters have fallopian\ntube abnormalities that lead to infertility.\n• Uterus. Many DES daughters have a uterus that is\nabnormal in size and shape. The classic sign is the T-shaped uterus. In the normal uterus, the cavity (hollowspace inside) is rounded. In a T-shaped uterus, the cavi-ty is reduced to a thin T. The abnormal shape of theinside of the uterus makes it harder for a woman to getpregnant and leads to a higher risk of premature laborand birth.\nDiagnosis\nWomen who have been exposed to DES should have\na pelvic exam at least once a year. In addition to the usualpelvic exam and Pap smear, DES daughters should alsohave Pap smears of the vagina and, if possible, col-\nposcopy . During colposcopy, the doctor looks at the\ncervix and vagina through a special magnifying scope. Inthis way, tiny areas of abnormal cells can be seen. Thisprocedure is easily performed in the doctor’s office.\nWhen DES daughters get pregnant, they may be at\nhigh risk for premature labor and birth and should bemonitored very carefully.\nNot all women who were exposed to DES develop\nproblems in pregnancy. However, if problems like infer-tility or miscarriage do occur, the doctor may recom-mend a special x-ray test to check the woman’s fallopiantubes and uterus. This special test is called a hysterosalp-ingogram.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment for the abnormalities of the\nfallopian tubes and uterus caused by DES exposure.

It is based onthe principle that illnesses can be caused by the accumu-lation of toxic substances (toxins) in the body. Eliminat-ing existing toxins and avoiding new toxins are essentialparts of the healing process. Detoxification utilizes avariety of tests and techniques.\nPurpose\nDetoxification is helpful for those patients suffering\nfrom many chronic diseases and conditions, includingallergies ,anxiety , arthritis, asthma , chronic infections,\ndepression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease, high\ncholesterol , low blood sugar levels, digestive disorders,\nmental illness, and obesity . It is helpful for those with\nconditions that are influenced by environmental factors,such as cancer , as well as for those who have been\nexposed to high levels of toxic materials due to accidentor occupation. Detoxification therapy is useful for thosesuffering from allergies or immune system problemsthat conventional medicine is unable to diagnose ortreat, including chronic fatigue syndrome , environ-\nmental illness/multiple chemical sensitivity, andfibromyalgia . Symptoms for those suffering these con-\nditions may include unexplained fatigue , increased\nallergies, hypersensitivity to common materials, intoler-ance to certain foods and indigestion , aches and pains,\nlow grade fever , headaches, insomnia , depression, sore\nthroats, sudden weight loss or gain, lowered resistanceto infection, general malaise, and disability. Detoxifica-tion can be used as a beneficial preventative measureand as a tool to increase overall health, vitality, andresistance to disease.\nDescription\nOrigins\nDetoxification methods of healing have been used for\nthousands of years. Fasting , is one of the oldest therapeu-\ntic practices in medicine. Hippocrates, the ancient Greekknown as the “Father of Western medicine,” recommend-ed fasting as a means for improving health. Ayurvedic\nmedicine , a traditional healing system that has developed\nover thousands of years, utilizes detoxification methodsto treat many chronic conditions and to prevent illness.\nDetoxification treatment has become one of the cor-\nnerstones of alternative medicine. Conventional medicinenotes that environmental factors can play a significant rolein many illnesses. Environmental medicine is a field thatstudies exactly how those environmental factors influencedisease. Conditions such as asthma, cancer, chronicfatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity , and\nmany others are strongly influenced by exposure to toxicor allergenic substances in the environment. The UnitedStates Centers for Disease Control estimate that over 80%of all illnesses have environmental and lifestyle causes.\nDetoxification has also become a prominent treat-\nment as people have become more aware of environmen-tal pollution. It is estimated that one in every four Ameri-cans suffers from some level of heavy metal poisoning .\nHeavy metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, andarsenic, are by-products of industry. Synthetic agricul-ture chemicals, many of which are known to cause healthproblems, are also found in food, air, and water. Ameri-can agriculture uses nearly 10 lb (4.5 kg) of pesticidesper person on the food supply each year. These toxinshave become almost unavoidable. Pesticides that areused only on crops in the southern United States havebeen found in the tissue of animals in the far north ofCanada. DDT, a cancer-causing insecticide that has beenbanned for decades, is still regularly found in the fattytissue of animals, birds, and fish, even in extremelyremote regions such as the North Pole.\nThe problem of toxins in the environment is com-\npounded because humans are at the top of the food chainand are more likely to be exposed to an accumulation oftoxic substances in the food supply. For instance, pesti-cides and herbicides are sprayed on grains that are thenfed to farm animals. Toxic substances are stored in thefatty tissue of those animals. In addition, those animalsare often injected with synthetic hormones, antibiotics ,\nand other chemicals. When people eat meat products,they are exposed to the full range of chemicals and addi-tives used along the entire agricultural chain. Detoxifica-tion specialists call this build up of toxins bioaccumula-\ntion. They assert that the bioaccumulation of toxic sub-\nstances over time is responsible for many physical andmental disorders, especially ones that are increasingrapidly (like asthma, cancer, and mental illness). As aresult, detoxification therapies are increasing in impor-tance and popularity.\nToxins in the body include heavy metals and various\nchemicals such as pesticides, pollutants, and food addi-tives. Drugs and alcohol have toxic effects in the body.Toxins are produced as normal by-products in theintestines by the bacteria that break down food. The diges-tion of protein also creates toxic by-products in the body.\nThe body has natural methods of detoxification.\nIndividual cells get detoxified in the lymph and circula-tory system. The liver is the principle organ of detoxifi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1041Detoxificationcation, assisted by the kidneys and intestines. Toxins can\nbe excreted from the body by the kidneys, bowels, skin,and lungs. Detoxification treatments become necessarywhen the body’s natural detoxification systems becomeoverwhelmed. This can be caused by long-term effects ofimproper diet, stress , overeating, sedentary lifestyles, ill-\nness, and poor health habits in general. When a build upof toxic substances in the body creates illness, it’s calledtoxemia. Some people’s digestive tracts become unableto digest food properly, due to years of overeating anddiets that are high in fat and processed foods and low in\nfiber (the average American diet). When this happens,food cannot pass through the digestive tract efficiently.Instead of being digested properly or eliminated from thebowel, food can literally rot inside the digestive tract andproduce toxic by-products. This state is known as toxiccolon syndrome or intestinal toxemia.\nDetoxification therapies try to activate and assist the\nbody’s own detoxification processes. They also try toeliminate additional exposure to toxins and strengthenthe body and immune system so that toxic imbalanceswon’t occur in the future.\nTesting for toxic substances\nDetoxification specialists use a variety of tests to\ndetermine the causes contributing to toxic conditions.These causes include infections, allergies, addictions,toxic chemicals, and digestive and organ dysfunction.Blood, urine, stool, and hair analyses, as well as allergy\ntests , are used to measure a variety of bodily functions\nthat may indicate problems. Detoxification therapistsusually have access to laboratories that specialize insophisticated diagnostic tests for toxic conditions.\nPeople who have toxemia are often susceptible to\ninfection because their immune systems are weakened.Infections can be caused by parasites, bacteria, viruses,and a common yeast. Therapists will screen patients forunderlying infections that may be contributing to illness.\nLiver function is studied closely with blood and\nurine tests because the liver is the principle organ in thebody responsible for removing toxic compounds. Whenthe liver detoxifies a substance from the body, it does soin two phases. Tests are performed that indicate whereproblems may be occurring in these phases, which maypoint to specific types of toxins. Blood and urine testscan also be completed that screen for toxic chemicalssuch as PCBs (environmental poisons), formaldehyde (acommon preservative), pesticides, and heavy metals.Another useful blood test is a test for zinc deficiency,which may reveal heavy metal poisoning . Hair analysis\nis used to test for heavy metal levels in the body. Bloodand urine tests check immune system activity, and hor-mone levels can also indicate specific toxic compounds.\nA 24-hour urine analysis, where samples are takenaround the clock, allows therapists to determine the effi-ciency of the digestive tract and kidneys. Together withstool analysis, these tests may indicate toxic bowel syn-drome and digestive system disorders. Certain blood andurine tests may point to nutritional deficiencies and prop-er recovery diets can be designed for patients as well.\nDetoxification therapists may also perform extensive\nallergy and hypersensitivity tests. Intradermal (betweenlayers of the skin) and sublingual (under the tongue)allergy tests are used to determine a patient’s sensitivityto a variety of common substances, including formalde-hyde, auto exhaust, perfume, tobacco, chlorine, jet fuel,and other chemicals.\nFood allergies require additional tests because these\nallergies often cause reactions that are delayed for severaldays after the food is eaten. The RAST (radioallergosor-bent test) is a blood test that determines the level of anti-bodies (immunoglobulins) in the blood after specificfoods are eaten. The cytotoxic test is a blood test thatdetermines if certain substances affect blood cells, includ-ing foods and chemicals. The ELISA-ACT (enzyme-linked immunoserological assay activated cell test) isconsidered to be one of the most accurate tests for aller-gies and hypersensitivity to foods, chemicals, and otheragents. Other tests for food allergies are the eliminationand rotation diets, in which foods are systematically eval-uated to determine the ones that are causing problems.\nDetoxification therapists usually interview and\ncounsel patients closely to determine and correctlifestyle, occupational, psychological, and emotional fac-tors that may also be contributing to illness.\nDetoxification therapies\nDetoxification therapists use a variety of healing\ntechniques after a diagnosis is made. The first step is toeliminate a patient’s exposure to all toxic or allergenicsubstances. These include heavy metals, chemicals, radi-ation (from x rays, power lines, cell phones, computerscreens, and microwaves), smog, polluted water, foods,drugs, caffeine , alcohol, perfume, excess noise, and\nstress. If mercury poisoning has been determined, thepatient will be advised to have mercury fillings from theteeth removed, preferably by a holistic dentist.\nSpecific treatments are used to stimulate and assist\nthe body’s detoxification process. Dietary change isimmediately enacted, eliminating allergic and unhealthyfoods, and emphasizing foods that assist detoxificationand support healing. Detoxification diets are generallylow in fat, high in fiber, and vegetarian with a raw foodemphasis. Processed foods, alcohol, and caffeine are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1042Detoxificationavoided. Nutritional supplements such as vitamins ,min-\nerals , antioxidants, amino acids, and essential fatty acids\nare often prescribed. Spirulina is a sea algae that is fre-quently given to assist in eliminating heavy metals.Lipotropic agents are certain vitamins and nutrients thatpromote the flow of bile and fat from the liver.\nMany herbal supplements are used in detoxification\ntherapies as well. Milk thistle extract, called silymarin, isone of the more potent herbs for detoxifying the liver.Naturopathy, Ayurvedic medicine, and traditional Chi-\nnese medicine (TCM) recommend numerous herbal for-\nmulas for detoxification and immune strengthening. Ifinfections or parasites have been found, these are treatedwith herbal formulas and, in difficult cases, antibiotics. \nFor toxic bowel syndrome and digestive tract disor-\nders, herbal laxatives and high fiber foods such as psylli-\num seeds may be given to cleanse the digestive tract andpromote elimination. Colonics are used to cleanse thelower intestines. Digestive enzymes are prescribed toimprove digestion, and acidophilus and other friendlybacteria are reintroduced into the system with nutritionalsupplements.\nFasting is another major therapy in detoxification.\nFasting is one of the quickest ways to promote the elimina-tion of stored toxins in the body and to prompt the healingprocess. People with severe toxic conditions are supervisedclosely during fasting because the number of toxins in thebody temporarily increases as they are being released.\nChelation therapy is used by detoxification special-\nists to rid the body of heavy metals. Chelates are particu-lar substances that bind to heavy metals and speed theirelimination. Homeopathic remedies have also been\nshown to be effective for removing heavy metals.\nSweating therapies can also detoxify the body\nbecause the skin is a major organ of elimination. Sweatinghelps release those toxins that are stored in the subcuta-neous (under the skin) fat cells. Saunas, therapeutic baths,and exercise are some of these treatments. Body therapies\nmay also be prescribed, including massage therapy ,acu-\npressure ,shiatsu , manual lymph drainage, and polarity\ntherapy . These body therapies seek to improve circulatory\nand structural problems, reduce stress, and promote heal-ing responses in the body. Mind/body therapies such aspsychotherapy, counseling, and stress management tech-niques may be used to heal the psychological componentsof illness and to help patients overcome their negative pat-terns contributing to illness.\nPractitioners and treatment costs\nThe costs of detoxification therapies can vary wide-\nly, depending on the number of tests and treatmentsrequired. Detoxification treatments can be lengthy andinvolved since illnesses associated with toxic conditionsusually develop over many years and may not clear upquickly. Detoxification treatments may be lengthybecause they often strive for the holistic healing of thebody, mind, and emotions.\nPractitioners may be conventionally trained medical\ndoctors with specialties in environmental medicine orinterests in alternative treatment. The majority of detoxi-fication therapists are alternative practitioners, such asnaturopaths, homeopaths, ayurvedic doctors, or tradition-al Chinese doctors.

Detoxification specialists claim thatthese negative side effects are part of the healing process.These reactions are sometimes called healing crises ,\nwhich are caused by temporarily increased levels of tox-ins in the body due to elimination and cleansing.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAlthough environmental medicine is gaining more\nrespect within conventional medicine, detoxificationKEY TERMS\nAllergen —A foreign substance, such as mites in\nhouse dust or animal dander, that wheninhaled,causes the airways to narrow and pro-duces symptoms of asthma.\nAntibody —A protein, also called immunoglobu-\nlin, produced by immune system cells to removeantigens (the foreign substances that trigger theimmune response).\nFibromyalgia —A condition of debilitating pain,\namong other symptoms, in the muscles and themyofascia (the thin connective tissue that sur-rounds muscles, bones, and organs).\nHypersensitivity —The state where even a tiny\namount of allergen can cause severe allergic reac-tions.\nMultiple chemical sensitivity —A condition char-\nacterized by severe and crippling allergic reac-tions to commonly used substances, particularlychemicals.

    "title": "Deviated septum",
    "content": "Deviated septum\nDefinition\nThe nasal septum is a thin structure, separating the\ntwo sides of the nose. If it is not in the middle of thenose, then it is deviated.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1044Deviated septumDescription\nThe nasal septum is composed of two parts. Toward\nthe back of the head the nasal septum is rigid bone, butfurther forward the bone becomes cartilage. With onefinger in each nostril this cartilage can easily be bentback and forth. If the nasal septum is sufficiently dis-placed to one side, it will impede the flow of air andmucus through the nose. This condition, called a deviat-ed septum, can cause symptoms and disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nA deviated septum can be a simple variation in nor-\nmal structure or the result of a broken nose. Any narrow-ing of the nasal passageway that it causes will threatenthe drainage of secretions from the sinuses, which mustpass through the nose. It is a general rule of medicinethat when flow is obstructed, whether it is mucus fromthe sinuses or bile from the gall bladder, infection results.People with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) are at greater\nrisk of obstruction because their nasal passageways arealready narrowed by the swollen membranes lining them.The result is sinusitis , which can be acute and severe or\nchronic and lingering.\nDiagnosis\nIt is easy to see that a septum is deviated. It is more\ndifficult to determine if that deviation needs correction. Itis common for a patient to complain that he/she canbreathe through only one nostril. Then the diagnosis iseasy. A deviated septum may also contribute to snoring ,\nsleep apnea , and other breathing disorders.\nTreatment\nThe definitive treatment is surgical repositioning of\nthe septum, accomplished by breaking it loose and fixingit in a proper place while it heals. Decongestants like\npseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine will shrink themembranes and thereby enlarge the passages. Antihista-\nmines , nasal cortisone spray, and other allergy treat-\nments may also be temporarily beneficial.\nAlternative treatment\nAs a palliative, saline drops and sprays are very help-\nful in loosening mucus in the obstructed side and prevent-ing drying in the other side, where all the air blows. Hotpeppers, such as jalapenos, can produce enough tears anddischarge to flush out a stopped-up nose. An even moreeffective treatment is called a nasal lavage, often doneusing a small pot with a spout. Saline solution is pouredinto one nostril and allowed to flow out the other nostril.Then, the process is repeated in reverse. These therapies\nare all useful to take care of symptoms, but do not correctthe problem. Nasospecific, a procedure where a deflatedballoon is inserted in the nostril and inflated to a largeenough degree to adjust the septal deviation, can be analternative to surgery. A trained practitioner in thenasospecific procedure is necessary.\nPrognosis\nSurgical repair is curative and carries little risk.\nChronic infection can be painful and lead to complica-tions until it is resolved. If there is continued obstruction,the infection will very likely return.\nPrevention\nAvoidance of virus colds, airborne dusts, air pollu-\ntion, and known allergens will minimize the irritationand swelling of the membranes lining the nasal passages.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1045Deviated septum\nA close-up of person with a deviated septum.

Themassively increased urine output is usually accompaniedby intense thirst.\nDescription\nThe balance of fluid within the body is maintained\nthrough a number of mechanisms. One important chemi-cal involved in fluid balance is called antidiuretic hor-mone (ADH). ADH is produced by the pituitary, a smallgland located at the base of the brain. In a healthy personand under normal conditions, ADH is continuouslyKEY TERMS\nAllergen —Any substance that irritates people sen-\nsitive (allergic) to it.\nAllergic rhinitis —Swelling and inflammation of\nthe nasal membranes caused by sensitivity to air-borne matter like pollen or cat hair.\nSaline —A salt solution in water. Normal saline has\nthe same salt concentration as the body, 0.9%.\nSinuses —The nasal sinuses, air-filled cavities sur-\nrounding the eyes and nose, like the nose itself arelined with mucus-producing membranes. Theyprovide cleansing to the nose, resonance to thevoice, and structure to the face.\nSinusitis —Infection of the sinuses.\nSleep apnea —A condition in which breathing is\ntemporarily interrupted during sleep. It leads tohigh blood pressure, sleepiness, and a variety ofother problems.released. ADH influences the amount of fluid that the\nkidneys reabsorb into the circulatory system and theamount of fluid that the kidneys pass out of the body inthe form of urine.\nProduction of ADH is regulated by the osmolality of\nthe circulating blood. Osmolality refers to the concentra-tion of dissolved chemicals (such as sodium, potassium,and chloride; together called solute) circulating in thefluid base of the blood (plasma). When there is very littlefluid compared to the concentration of solute, the pitu-itary will increase ADH production. This tells the kid-neys to retain more water and to decrease the amount ofurine produced. As fluid is retained, the concentration ofsolute will normalize. At other times, when the fluid con-tent of the blood is high in comparison to the concentra-tion of solute, ADH production will decrease. The kid-neys are then free to pass an increased amount of fluidout of the body in the urine. Again, this will allow theplasma osmolality to return to normal.\nDiabetes insipidus occurs when either the amount of\nADH produced by the pituitary is below normal (centralDI), or the kidneys’ ability to respond to ADH is defective(nephrogenic DI). In either case, a person with DI willpass extraordinarily large quantities of urine, sometimesreaching 10 or more liters each day. At the same time, thepatient’s blood will be very highly concentrated, with lowfluid volume and high concentrations of solute.\nDI occurs on average when a person is about 24\nyears old, and occurs more frequently in males than infemales.\nCauses and symptoms\nDI may run in families. The cause of this type of DI\nis unknown. Other times, central DI can be caused by:\n• an injury to the head• brain surgery• cancers that have spread to the pituitary gland (most\ncommonly occurring with breast cancer )\n• sarcoidosis (or other related disorders), causing\ndestruction of the pituitary gland\n• any condition or illness that causes decreased oxygen\ndelivery to the brain\n• the use of certain medications that decrease ADH produc-\ntion (like the antiseizure drug phenytoin)\n• the excessive use of alcohol\nCentral DI may also occur in women who are preg-\nnant or have just given birth, and in patients with AIDS\nwho have suffered certain types of brain infections.Nephrogenic DI sometimes occurs in patients who are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1046Diabetes insipidustaking the medication lithium, patients who have high\nlevels of blood calcium, and patients who are pregnant.\nDI is easily confused with an entirely unrelated dis-\norder, psychogenic polydipsia. Polydipsia refers todrinking large amounts of water. Psychogenic polydipsiais a psychiatric problem that makes a person drink hugequantities of water uncontrollably.\nSymptoms of DI include extreme thirst and the pro-\nduction of tremendous quantities of urine. Patients withDI typically drink huge amounts of water, and usuallyreport a specific craving for cold water. When the amountof water passed in the urine exceeds the patient’s abilityto drink ample replacement water, the patient may beginto suffer from symptoms of dehydration . These symp-\ntoms include weakness, fatigue ,fever , low blood pres-\nsure, increased heart rate, dizziness , and confusion. If\nleft untreated, the patient could lapse into unconscious-ness and die.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis should be suspected in any patient with\nsudden increased thirst and urination. Laboratory exami-nation of urine will reveal very dilute urine, made upmostly of water with no solute. Examination of the bloodwill reveal very concentrated blood, high in solute andlow in fluid volume.\nA water deprivation test may be performed. This test\nrequires a patient to stop all fluid intake. The patient isweighed just before the test begins, and urine is collectedand examined hourly. The test is stopped when:\n• the patient has lost more than 5% of his or her original\nbody weight\n• the patient has reached certain limits of low blood pres-\nsure and increased heart rate\n• the urine is no longer changing significantly from one\nsample to the next in terms of solute concentration\nThe next step of the test involves injecting a synthet-\nic form of ADH, with one last urine sample examined 60minutes later. Comparing plasma and urine osmolalityallows the doctor to diagnose either central DI, nephro-genic DI, partial DI, or psychogenic polydipsia.\nTreatment\nA number of medications can be given to decrease\nthe quantity of fluid passed out into the urine. Theseinclude vasopressin (Pitressin) injected and desmo-pressin acetate (DDA VP) inhaled through the nose. Othermedications that may be given include some antidiureticdrugs (chlorpropamide, clofibrate, carbamazepine).Patients with nephrogenic DI, however, will also requireKEY TERMS\nConcentration —Refers to the amount of solute pre-\nsent in a solution, compared to the total amount ofsolvent.\nDilute —A solution that has comparatively more\nfluid in it, relative to the quantity of solute.\nOsmolality —A measure of the solute-to-solvent\nconcentration of a solution.\nSolute —Solid substances that are dissolved in liq-\nuid in order to make a solution.\nspecial diets that restrict the amount of solute taken in.\nThese patients are also treated with a type of medicationcalled a thiazide diuretic.\nPrognosis\nUncomplicated diabetes insipidus is controllable\nwith adequate intake of water and most patients can leadnormal lives.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFishman, Mark C., et al.

Symptoms include frequent urination, lethargy,excessive thirst, and hunger. The treatment includeschanges in diet, oral medications, and in some cases,daily injections of insulin.\nDescription\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes\nserious health complications including renal (kidney)failure, heart disease, stroke , and blindness. Approxi-\nmately 14 million Americans (about 5% of the popula-tion) have diabetes. Unfortunately, as many as one-halfare unaware that they have it.\nBackground\nEvery cell in the human body needs energy in order\nto function. The body’s primary energy source is glu-cose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion offoods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches).Glucose from the digested food circulates in the bloodas a ready energy source for any cells that need it.Insulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells inthe pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.Insulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell andacts like a key to open a doorway into the cell throughwhich glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can beconverted to concentrated energy sources like glycogenor fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is notenough insulin produced or when the doorway no longerrecognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the bloodrather entering the cells.\nThe body will attempt to dilute the high level of\nglucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia,by drawing water out of the cells and into the blood-stream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it inthe urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnoseddiabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities ofwater, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get ridof the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucosein the urine.\nAt the same time that the body is trying to get rid\nof glucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glu-cose and sending signals to the body to eat more food,thus making patients extremely hungry. To provideenergy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con-vert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fatsand proteins for energy causes acid compounds calledketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also beexcreted in the urine. As ketones build up in the blood,a condition called ketoacidosis can occur. This condi-tion can be life threatening if left untreated, leading tocoma and death .Types of diabetes mellitus\nType I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes,\nbegins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. Inthis form of diabetes, the body produces little or noinsulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occursmore frequently in populations descended from NorthernEuropean countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia) thanin those from Southern European countries, the MiddleEast, or Asia. In the United States, approximately threepeople in 1,000 develop Type I diabetes. This form is alsocalled insulin-dependent diabetes because people whodevelop this type need to have daily injections of insulin.\nBrittle diabetics are a subgroup of Type I where\npatients have frequent and rapid swings of blood sugarlevels between hyperglycemia (a condition where there istoo much glucose or sugar in the blood) and hypo-\nglycemia (a condition where there is abnormally low lev-\nels of glucose or sugar in the blood). These patients mayrequire several injections of different types of insulinduring the day to keep the blood sugar level within a fair-ly normal range.\nThe more common form of diabetes, Type II, occurs\nin approximately 3–5% of Americans under 50 years ofage, and increases to 10–15% in those over 50. Morethan 90% of the diabetics in the United States are Type IIdiabetics. Sometimes called age-onset or adult-onset dia-betes, this form of diabetes occurs most often in peoplewho are overweight and who do not exercise . It is also\nmore common in people of Native American, Hispanic,and African-American descent. People who have migrat-ed to Western cultures from East India, Japan, and Aus-tralian Aboriginal cultures are also more likely to devel-op Type II diabetes than those who remain in their origi-nal countries.\nType II is considered a milder form of diabetes\nbecause of its slow onset (sometimes developing over thecourse of several years) and because it can usually becontrolled with diet and oral medication. The conse-quences of uncontrolled and untreated Type II diabetes,however, are the just as serious as those for Type I. Thisform is also called noninsulin-dependent diabetes, a termthat is somewhat misleading. Many people with Type IIdiabetes can control the condition with diet and oralmedications, however, insulin injections are sometimesnecessary if treatment with diet and oral medication isnot working.\nAnother form of diabetes called gestational dia-\nbetes can develop during pregnancy and generally\nresolves after the baby is delivered. This diabetic condi-tion develops during the second or third trimester ofpregnancy in about 2% of pregnancies. The condition isusually treated by diet, however, insulin injections may\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1048Diabetes mellitusbe required. These women who have diabetes during\npregnancy are at higher risk for developing Type II dia-betes within 5–10 years.\nDiabetes can also develop as a result of pancreatic\ndisease, alcoholism ,malnutrition , or other severe ill-\nnesses that stress the body.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThe causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev-\ner, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factorspassed on in families) and environmental factorsinvolved. Research has shown that some people whodevelop diabetes have common genetic markers. In TypeI diabetes, the immune system, the body’s defense sys-tem against infection, is believed to be triggered by avirus or another microorganism to destroy the cells in thepancreas that produce insulin. In Type II diabetes, age,obesity , and family history of diabetes play a roll.\nIn Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce\nenough insulin, however, cells have become resistant tothe insulin produced and it may not work as effectively.Symptoms of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually thata person may not know that they have it. Early signs arelethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Othersymptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow woundhealing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurredvision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect-ed while a patient is seeing a doctor about another healthconcern that is actually being caused by the yet undiag-nosed diabetes.\nIndividuals who are at high risk of developing Type\nII diabetes mellitus include people who:\n• are obese (more than 20% above their ideal body\nweight)\n• have a relative with diabetes mellitus\n• belong to a high-risk ethnic population (African-Amer-\nican, Native American, Hispanic, or Native Hawaiian)\n• have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have\ndelivered a baby weighing more than 9 lbs (4 kg)\n• have high blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or above)\n• have a high density lipoprotein cholesterol level less\nthan or equal to 35 mg/dL and/or a triglyceride levelgreater than or equal to 250 mg/dL\n• have had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fast-\ningglucose on previous testing\nSeveral common medications can impair the body’s\nuse of insulin, causing a condition known as secondarydiabetes. These medications include treatments for highblood pressure (furosemide, clonidine, and thiazide\ndiuretics ), drugs with hormonal activity ( oral contra-\nceptives , thyroid hormone, progestins, and glucocorti-\ncorids), and the anti-inflammation drug indomethacin.Several drugs that are used to treat mood disorders\n(such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose\nabsorption. These drugs include haloperidol, lithium car-bonate, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, andadrenergic agonists. Other medications that can causediabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid,cimetidine, and heparin.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over\ndays or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles-cents, or can develop gradually (over several years) inoverweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp-toms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination,excessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss.\nKetoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or\nuncontrolled diabetes, is common in Type I diabetes.Ketones are acid compounds that form in the blood whenthe body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptomsinclude abdominal pain , vomiting, rapid breathing,\nextreme lethargy and drowsiness. Patients with ketoaci-dosis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated,this condition can lead to coma and death.\nWith Type II diabetes, the condition may not become\nevident until the patient presents for medical treatment forsome other condition. A patient may have heart disease,chronic infections of the gums and urinary tract, blurredvision, numbness in the feet and legs, or slow-healingwounds . Women may experience genital itching .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1049Diabetes mellitus\nWrinkled, dehydrated skin of a person in a diabetic coma.\nUntreated diabetes mellitus results in elevated blood glu-cose levels, causing a variety of symptoms that can culmi-nate in a diabetic coma. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced\nby permission.)Diagnosis\nDiabetes is suspected based on symptoms. Urine and\nblood tests can be used to confirm a diagnose of diabetesbased on the amount of glucose. Urine tests can alsodetect ketones and protein in the urine that may helpdiagnose diabetes and assess how well the kidneys arefunctioning. These tests can also be used to monitor thedisease once the patient is on a standardized diet, oralmedications, or insulin.\nUrine tests\nClinistix and Diastix are paper strips or dipsticks\nthat change color when dipped in urine. The test strip iscompared to a chart which shows the amount of glucosein the urine based on the change in color. The level ofglucose in the urine lags behind the level of glucose inthe blood. Testing the urine with a test stick, paper strip,or tablet that changes color when sugar is present is notas accurate as blood testing, however it can give a fastand simple reading.\nKetones in the urine can be detected using similar\ntypes of dipstick tests (Acetest or Ketostix). Ketoacidosiscan be a life-threatening situation in Type I diabetics, sohaving a quick and simple test to detect ketones canassist in establishing a diagnosis sooner.\nAnother dipstick test can determine the presence of\nprotein or albumin in the urine. Protein in the urine canKEY TERMS\nCataracts —A condition where the lens of the eye\nbecomes cloudy.\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy —A condition where\nthe sensitivity of nerves to pain, temperature, andpressure is dulled particularly in the legs and feet.\nDiabetic retinopathy —A condition where the tiny\nblood vessels to the retina, the tissues that senselight at the back of the eye, are damaged, leading toblurred vision, sudden blindness, or black spots,lines, or flashing light in the field of vision.\nGlaucoma —A condition where pressure within the\neye causes damage to the optic nerve, which sendsvisual images to the brain.\nHyperglycemia —A condition where there is too\nmuch glucose or sugar in the blood.\nHypoglycemia —A condition where there is too lit-\ntle glucose or sugar in the blood.Insulin —A hormone or chemical produced by the\npancreas, insulin is needed by cells of the body inorder to use glucose (sugar), the body’s main sourceof energy.\nKetoacidosis —A condition due to starvation or\nuncontrolled Type I diabetes. Ketones are acid com-pounds that form in the blood when the bodybreaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms includeabdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing, extremetiredness, and drowsiness.\nKidney dialysis —A process where blood is filtered\nthrough a dialysis machine to remove waste prod-ucts that would normally be removed by the kid-neys. The filtered blood is then circulated back intothe patient. This process is also called renal dialysis.\nPancreas —A gland located behind the stomach that\nproduces insulin.\nindicate problems with kidney function and can be used\nto track the development of renal failure. A more sensitivetest for urine protein uses radioactively tagged chemicalsto detect microalbuminuria, small amounts of protein inthe urine, that may not show up on dipstick tests.\nBlood tests\nFASTING GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is drawn from a vein\nin the patient’s arm after a period at least eight hours whenthe patient has not eaten, usually in the morning beforebreakfast. The red blood cells are separated from the sam-ple and the amount of glucose is measured in the remain-ing plasma. A plasma level of 7.8 mmol/L (200 mg/L) orgreater can indicate diabetes. The fasting glucose test isusually repeated on another day to confirm the results.\nPOSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is taken right\nafter the patient has eaten a meal.\nORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. Blood samples are\ntaken from a vein before and after a patient drinks a thick,sweet syrup of glucose and other sugars. In a non-diabet-ic, the level of glucose in the blood goes up immediatelyafter the drink and then decreases gradually as insulin isused by the body to metabolize, or absorb, the sugar. In adiabetic, the glucose in the blood goes up and stays highafter drinking the sweetened liquid. A plasma glucoselevel of 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or higher at two hoursafter drinking the syrup and at one other point during thetwo-hour test period confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1050Diabetes mellitusA diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed if there are\nsymptoms of diabetes and a plasma glucose level of atleast 11.1 mmol/L, a fasting plasma glucose level of atleast 7 mmol/L; or a two-hour plasma glucose level of atleast 11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test.\nHome blood glucose monitoring kits are available so\npatients with diabetes can monitor their own levels. Asmall needle or lancet is used to prick the finger and adrop of blood is collected and analyzed by a monitoringdevice. Some patients may test their blood glucose levelsseveral times during a day and use this information toadjust their doses of insulin.\nTreatment\nThere is currently no cure for diabetes; the condi-\ntion, however, can be managed so that patients can live arelatively normal life. Treatment of diabetes focuses ontwo goals: keeping blood glucose within normal rangeand preventing the development of long-term complica-tions. Careful monitoring of diet, exercise, and bloodglucose levels are as important as the use of insulin ororal medications in preventing complications of diabetes.\nDietary changes\nDiet and moderate exercise are the first treatments\nimplemented in diabetes. For many Type II diabetics,weight loss may be an important goal in helping them tocontrol their diabetes. A well-balanced, nutritious diet pro-vides approximately 50–60% of calories from carbohy-drates, approximately 10–20% of calories from protein,and less than 30% of calories from fat. The number ofcalories required by an individual depends on their age,weight, and activity level. The calorie intake also needs tobe distributed over the course of the entire day so surges ofglucose entering the blood system are kept to a minimum.\nKeeping track of the number of calories provided by\ndifferent foods can become complicated, so patients areusually advised to consult a nutritionist or dietitian. Anindividualized, easy to manage diet plan can be set up foreach patient. Both the American Diabetes Association andthe American Dietetic Association recommend diets based\non the use of food exchange lists. Each food exchangecontains a known amount of calories in the form of pro-tein, fat, or carbohydrate. A patient’s diet plan will consistof a certain number of exchanges from each food category(meat or protein, fruits, breads and starches, vegetables,and fats) to be eaten at meal times and as snacks. Patientshave flexibility in choosing which foods they eat as longas they stick with the number of exchanges prescribed.\nFor many Type II diabetics, weight loss is an impor-\ntant factor in controlling their condition. The foodexchange system, along with a plan of moderate exer-\ncise, can help them lose excess weight and improve theiroverall health.\nOral medications\nOral medications are available to lower blood glucose\nin Type II diabetics. The drugs first prescribed for Type IIdiabetes are in a class of compounds called sulfonylureasand include tolbutamide, tolazamide, acetohexamide, andchlorpropamide. Newer drugs in the same class are nowavailable and include glyburide, glimeperide, and glip-izide. The way that these drugs work is not well under-stood, however, they seem to stimulate cells of the pan-creas to produce more insulin. New medications that areavailable to treat diabetes include metformin, acarbose,and troglitizone. The choice of the right medicationdepends in part on the individual patient profile. All drugshave side effects that may make them inappropriate forparticular patients. Some for example, may stimulateweight gain or cause stomach irritation, so they may not bethe best treatment for someone who is already overweightor who also has stomach ulcers. While these medicationsare an important aspect of treatment for Type II diabetes,they are not a substitute for a well planned diet and moder-ate exercise. Oral medications are not effective for Type Idiabetes, in which the patient produces little or no insulin.\nInsulin\nPatients with Type I diabetes need daily injections of\ninsulin to help their bodies use glucose. The amount andtype of insulin required depends on the height, weight,age, food intake, and activity level of the individual dia-betic patient. Some patients with Type II diabetes mayneed to use insulin injections if their diabetes cannot becontrolled with diet, exercise, and oral medication. Injec-tions are given subcutaneously, that is, just under theskin, using a small needle and syringe. Injection sites canbe anywhere on the body where there is looser skin,including the upper arm, abdomen, or upper thigh.\nPurified human insulin is most commonly used,\nhowever, insulin from beef and pork sources are alsoavailable. Insulin may be given as an injection of a singledose of one type of insulin once a day. Different types ofinsulin can be mixed and given in one dose or split intotwo or more doses during a day. Patients who requiremultiple injections over the course of a day may be ableto use an insulin pump that administers small doses ofinsulin on demand. The small battery-operated pump isworn outside the body and is connected to a needle that isinserted into the abdomen. Pumps can be programmed toinject small doses of insulin at various times during theday, or the patient may be able to adjust the insulin dosesto coincide with meals and exercise.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1051Diabetes mellitusRegular insulin is fast-acting and starts to work within\n15–30 minutes, with its peak glucose-lowering effectabout two hours after it is injected. Its effects last for aboutfour to six hours. NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) andLente insulin are intermediate-acting, starting to workwithin one to three hours and lasting up to 18–26 hours.Ultra-lente is a long-acting form of insulin that starts towork within four to eight hours and lasts 28–36 hours.\nHypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be caused by\ntoo much insulin, too little food (or eating too late tocoincide with the action of the insulin), alcohol con-sumption, or increased exercise. A patient with symp-toms of hypoglycemia may be hungry, cranky, confused,and tired. The patient may become sweaty and shaky.Left untreated, the patient can lose consciousness or havea seizure. This condition is sometimes called an insulinreaction and should be treated by giving the patientsomething sweet to eat or drink like a candy, sugar cubes,juice, or another high sugar snack.\nSurgery\nTransplantation of a healthy pancreas into a diabetic\npatient is a successful treatment, however, this transplantis usually done only if a kidney transplant is performed atthe same time. Although a pancreas transplant is possi-ble, it is not clear if the potential benefits outweigh therisks of the surgery and drug therapy needed.\nAlternative treatment\nSince diabetes can be life-threatening if not properly\nmanaged, patients should not attempt to treat this condi-tion without medicial supervision. A variety of alterna-tive therapies can be helpful in managing the symptomsof diabetes and supporting patients with the disease.Acupuncture can help relieve the pain associated with\ndiabetic neuropathy by stimulation of cetain points. A\nqualified practitioner should be consulted. Herbal reme-dies may also be helpful in managing diabetes. Althoughthere is no herbal substitute for insulin, some herbs mayhelp adjust blood sugar levels or manage other diabeticsymptoms. Some options include:\n• fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum ) has been\nshown in some studies to reduce blood insulin and glu-cose levels while also lowering cholesterol\n• bilberry ( Vaccinium myrtillus ) may lower blood glu-\ncose levels, as well as helping to maintain healthyblood vessels\n• garlic ( Allium sativum ) may lower blood sugar and cho-\nlesterol levels\n• onions ( Allium cepa ) may help lower blood glucose\nlevels by freeing insulin to metabolize it• cayenne pepper ( Capsicum frutescens ) can help relieve\npain in the peripheral nerves (a type of diabetic neu-ropathy)\n• ginkgo ( Gingko biloba ) may maintain blood flow to the\nretina, helping to prevent diabetic retinopathy\nAny therapy that lowers stress levels can also be use-\nful in treating diabetes by helping to reduce insulinrequirements. Among the alternative treatments that aimto lower stress are hypnotherapy ,biofeedback , and\nmeditation .\nPrognosis\nUncontrolled diabetes is a leading cause of blind-\nness, end-stage renal disease, and limb amputations. Italso doubles the risks of heart disease and increases therisk of stroke. Eye problems including cataracts ,glau-\ncoma , and diabetic retinopathy are also more common in\ndiabetics.\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition\nwhere nerve endings, particularly in the legs and feetbecome less sensitive. Diabetic foot ulcers are a partic-ular problem since the patient does not feel the pain ofa blister, callous, or other minor injury. Poor blood cir-culation in the legs and feet contribute to delayedwound healing. The inability to sense pain along withthe complications of delayed wound healing can resultin minor injuries, blisters, or callouses becominginfected and difficult to treat. In cases of severe infec-tion, the infected tissue begins to break down and rotaway. The most serious consequence of this conditionis the need for amputation of toes, feet, or legs due to\nsevere infection.\nHeart disease and kidney disease are common com-\nplications of diabetes. Long-term complications mayinclude the need for kidney dialysis or a kidney trans-\nplant due to kidney failure.\nBabies born to diabetic mothers have an increased\nrisk of birth defects and distress at birth.\nPrevention\nResearch continues on ways to prevent diabetes and\nto detect those at risk for developing diabetes. While theonset of Type I diabetes is unpredictable, the risk ofdeveloping Type II diabetes can be reduced by maintain-ing ideal weight and exercising regularly. The physicaland emotional stress of surgery, illness, pregnancy, andalcoholism can increase the risks of diabetes, so main-taining a healthy lifestyle is critical to preventing theonset of Type II diabetes and preventing further compli-cations of the disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1052Diabetes mellitusResources\nBOOKS\n“Diabetes Mellitus.” In Professional Guide to Diseases. 5th ed.\nSpringhouse, PA: Springhouse Corporation, 1995.\nFoster, Daniel W. “Diabetes Mellitus.” In Harrison’s Principles\nof Internal Medicine , ed.

Because a personwho has diabetes may not feel foot pain or discomfort,\nproblems can remain undetected until fever , weakness, or\nother signs of systemic infection appear. As a result, evenminor irritations occur more often, heal more slowly, andare more likely to result in serious health problems.\nWith diabetes, foot infections occur more frequently\nbecause the disease causes nervous system changes andpoor circulation. Because the nerves that control sweat-ing no longer work, the skin of the feet can become verydry and cracked, and calluses tend to occur more fre-quently and build up faster. If not trimmed regularly,these calluses can turn into open sores or ulcers. Becausediabetic nerve damage can cause a loss of sensation (neu-ropathy), if the feet are not regularly inspected, an ulcercan quickly become infected and, if not treated, mayresult in the death of tissue ( gangrene ) or amputation .\nThe risk of infection is greatest for people who are\nover the age of 60 and for those who have one or more ofthe following:\n• poorly controlled diabetes\n• foot ulcers\n• laser treatment for changes in the retina\n• kidney or vascular disease\n• loss of sensation (neuropathy)\nCauses and symptoms\nBacteria can cause an infection through small cracks\n(fissures) that can develop in the dry skin around the heeland on other parts of the foot or through corns, calluses,blisters, hangnails, or ulcers. If not treated, the bacterialinfection can destroy skin, tissue, and bone or spreadthroughout the body.\nCommon sites of diabetic foot infections include the\nfollowing:\n• blisters, corns, or callouses that bleed beneath the skin\n• bunions, hammertoes, or other abnormalities in the\nbones of the foot\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1053Diabetic foot infectionsKEY TERMS\nFissure —A deep crack.\nNeuropathy —An abnormality of the nerves out-\nside the brain and spinal cord.\nUlcer —A sore or lesion.\n• scar tissue that has grown over the site of an earlier\ninfection\n• foot ulcers caused by pressure, nerve damage, or poor\ncirculation (Ulcers occur most often over the ball of thefoot, on the bottom of the big toe, or on the sides of thefoot due to poorly fitting shoes.)\n• injuries that tear or puncture the skin.\nDiagnosis\nA physician who specializes in the treatment of the\nfoot (podiatrist) or the doctor who normally treats thepatient’s diabetes will treat the infection.

Any dead or infected tissuewill be surgically removed and, if necessary, a castand/or special shoes may be used to protect the area. Inaddition, the patient will be instructed to keep off theirfeet. If the ulcer does not heal, the physician may per-form surgery to increase blood flow to the foot. It is alsoimportant for the patient to practice good diabetes con-trol and keep blood glucose levels from getting too high.\nAlternative treatment\nAcupuncture and vitamin C can boost the body’s\ninfection-fighting ability.

    "title": "Diabetic ketoacidosis",
    "content": "Diabetic ketoacidosis\nDefinition\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of\ndiabetes mellitus in which the chemical balance of the\nbody becomes far too acidic.\nDescription\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) always results from a\nsevere insulin deficiency. Insulin is the hormone secret-ed by the body to lower the blood sugar levels whenthey become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the diseaseresulting from the inability of the body to produce orrespond properly to insulin, required by the body toconvert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKAcomplications represent the leading cause of death ,\nmostly due to the accumulation of abnormally largeamounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema ). DKA\ncombines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean-ing excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone-mia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by thebody; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has becometoo acidic.\nInsulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi-\ntions: the body glucose goes largely unused since mostcells are unable to transport glucose into the cell withoutthe presence of insulin; this condition makes the bodyuse stored fat as an alternative source instead of theunavailable glucose for energy, a process that producesacidic ketones, which build up because they requireinsulin to be broken down. The presence of excessketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood tobecome more acidic than the body tissues, which createsa toxic condition.Causes and symptoms\nDKA is most commonly seen in individuals with\ntype I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usuallycaused by the interruption of their insulin treatment orby acute infection or trauma. A small number of peoplewith type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, butthis is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro-duce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in typeII patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in foodintake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper-glycemia.\nSome common DKA symptoms include:\n• high blood sugar levels\n• frequent urination (polyuria) and thirst• fatigue and lethargy\n• nausea\n• vomiting• abdominal pain\n• fruity odor to breath\n• rapid, deep breathing• muscle stiffness or aching\n•coma\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper-\nglycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab-lished if the patient’s urine or blood is strongly positivefor glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non-diabetic person on average range from 80–110 mg/dl.

Diabetic neuropathy may be diffuse,\naffecting several parts of the body, or focal, affecting aspecific nerve and part of the body.\nDescription\nThe nervous system consists of two major divisions:\nthe central nervous systems (CNS) which includes thebrain, the cranial nerves, and the spinal cord, and theperipheral nervous system (PNS) which includes thenerves that link the CNS with the sensory organs, mus-cles, blood vessels, and glands of the body. These periph-eral nerves are either motor, meaning that they areinvolved in motor activity such as walking, or sensory,meaning that they carry sensory information back to theCNS. The PNS also works with the CNS to regulateinvoluntary (autonomic) processes such as breathing,heartbeat, blood pressure, etc.\nThere are two types of diffuse diabetic neuropathy\nthat affect different nervous system functions. Diffuseperipheral neuropathy primarily affects the limbs, dam-\naging the nerves of the feet and hands. Autonomic neu-ropathy is the other form of diffuse neuropathy and itaffects the heart and other internal organs.\nFocal—or localized—diabetic neuropathy affects\nspecific nerves, most commonly in the torso, leg, or head.\nDiabetic neuropathy can lead to muscular weakness,\nloss of feeling or sensation, and loss of autonomic func-tions such as digestion, erection, bladder control andsweating among others.\nThe longer a person has diabetes, the more likely the\ndevelopment of one or more forms of neuropathy.Approximately 60–70% of patients with diabetes haveneuropathy, but only about 5% will experience painfulsymptoms.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of diabetic neuropathy is not\nknown. Researchers believe that the process of nervedamage is related to high glucose concentrations in theblood that could cause chemical changes in nerves, dis-rupting their ability to effectively send messages. Highblood glucose is also known to damage the blood vesselsthat carry oxygen and other nutrients to the nerves. Inaddition, some people may have a genetic predispositionto develop neuropathy.There is a wide range of symptoms associated with\ndiabetic neuropathy, and they depend on which nervesand parts of the body affected and also on the type ofneuropathy present. Some patients have very mild symp-toms, while others are severely disabled.\nCommon symptoms of diffuse peripheral neuropa-\nthy include:\n• numbness and feelings of tingling or burning\n• insensitivity to pain\n• needle-like jabs of pain• extreme sensitivity to touch• loss of balance and coordination\nCommon symptoms of diffuse autonomic neuropa-\nthy include:\n• impaired urination and sexual function\n• bladder infections• stomach disorders, due to the impaired ability of the\nstomach to empty (gastric stasis)\n• nausea, vomiting, bloating• dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells\n• loss of appetite\nCommon symptoms of focal neuropathy include:\n• pain in the front of a thigh• severe pain in the lower back• pain in the chest or stomach• ache behind an eye\n• double vision\n• paralysis on one side of the face\nIn severe diabetic neuropathy loss of sensation can\nlead to injuries that are unnoticed, progressing to infec-tions, ulceration, and possibly amputation .\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of neuropathy is based on the symp-\ntoms that present during a physical exam. Pain assess-ment is usually the first step. Patients may have morethan one type of pain, and the history helps the doctordetermine whether a the pain has a neuropathic cause.\nThe exam may include:\n• a screening test for lost sensation\n• nerve conduction studies to check the flow of electric\ncurrent through a nerve\n• electromyography (EMG) to see how well muscles\nrespond to electrical impulses transmitted by nearbynerves.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1057Diabetic neuropathy• ultrasound to show how the bladder and other parts of\nthe urinary tract are functioning\n• sometimes a nerve biopsy may be performed.\nSpecialists who treat diabetic neuropathy include:\n• neurologists: specialists in nervous system disorders\n• urologists: specialists in urinary tract disorder\n• gastroenterologists: specialists in digestive disorders\n• podiatrists: specialists in caring for the feet\nTreatment\nTreatment of diabetic neuropathy is usually focused\non treating the symptoms associated with the neuropathyand addressing the underlying cause by improving thecontrol of blood sugar levels, which may heal the earlystages of neuropathy.\nThere is no cure for the permanent nerve damage\ncaused by neuropathy. To help control pain, the choice ofproven drug therapies has broadened during the pastdecade. Pain medication, such as the topical skin creamcapsaicin, is usually no stronger than codeine because ofthe potential for addiction with long-term use of such\ndrugs. Four main classes of drugs are available for pain\nmanagement , alone or in combination: tricyclic antide-\npressants (Imipramine, Nortriptyline), narcotic anal-\ngesics (Morphine), anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine,\nGabapentin), and antiarrhythmics.KEY TERMS\nCentral nervous system (CNS) —Part of the ner-\nvous system consisting of the brain, cranial nerves,and spinal cord. The brain is the center of higherprocesses, such as thought and emotion, and isresponsible for the coordination and control ofbodily activities and the interpretation of informa-tion from the senses. The cranial nerves and spinalcord link the brain to the peripheral nervous sys-tem.\nDiabetes mellitus —Disease characterized by the\ninability of the body to produce or respond prop-erly to insulin, required by the body to convertglucose to energy.\nGlucose —The type of sugar found in the blood.\nPeripheral nervous system (PNS) —One of the two\nmajor divisions of the nervous system. PNS nerveslink the central nervous system with sensoryorgans, muscles, blood vessels, and glands.Prognosis\nEarly stage diabetic neuropathy can usually be\nreversed with good glucose control. Once nerve damagehas occurred it cannot be reversed. The prognosis is largelydependent on the management of the underlying condition,diabetes, which may halt the progression of the neuropathyand improve symptoms. Recovery, if it occurs, is slow.\nPrevention\nTight glucose control and the avoidance of alcohol\nand cigarettes help protect nerves from damage.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSaudek, Christopher D., Richard R.

    "content": "Dialysis, kidney\nDefinition\nDialysis treatment replaces the function of the kid-\nneys, which normally serve as the body’s natural filtra-tion system. Through the use of a blood filter and achemical solution known as dialysate, the treatmentremoves waste products and excess fluids from thebloodstream, while maintaining the proper chemical bal-ance of the blood. There are two types of dialysis treat-ment : hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\nPurpose\nDialysis can be used in the treatment of patients suf-\nfering from poisoning or overdose, in order to quickly\nremove drugs from the bloodstream. Its most prevalentapplication, however, is for patients with temporary or per-manent kidney failure. For patients with end-stage renaldisease (ESRD), whose kidneys are no longer capable ofadequately removing fluids and wastes from their body or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1058Dialysis, kidneyof maintaining the proper level of certain kidney-regulated\nchemicals in the bloodstream, dialysis is the only treat-ment option available outside of kidney transplantation .\nIn 1996 in the United States, over 200,000 people under-went regular dialysis treatments to manage their ESRD.\nPrecautions\nBlood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-\nsis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option inthese cases.\nPeritoneal dialysis is not recommended for patients\nwith abdominal adhesions or other abdominal defects,such as a hernia , that might compromise the efficiency\nof the treatment. It is also not recommended for patientswho suffer frequent bouts of diverticulitis, an inflamma-tion of small pouches in the intestinal tract.\nDescription\nThere are two types of dialysis treatment: hemodial-\nysis and peritoneal dialysis:Hemodialysis\nHemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed type\nof dialysis treatment in the United States. The treatmentinvolves circulating the patient’s blood outside of thebody through an extracorporeal circuit (ECC), or dialysiscircuit. Two needles are inserted into the patient’s vein,or access site, and are attached to the ECC, which con-sists of plastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer(artificial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitorsand maintains blood flow and administers dialysate.Dialysate is a chemical bath that is used to draw wasteproducts out of the blood.\nSince the 1980s, the majority of hemodialysis treat-\nments in the United States have been performed withhollow fiber dialyzers. A hollow fiber dialyzer is com-posed of thousands of tube-like hollow fiber strandsencased in a clear plastic cylinder several inches in diam-eter. There are two compartments within the dialyzer (theblood compartment and the dialysate compartment). Themembrane that separates these two compartments issemipermeable. This means that it allows the passage ofcertain sized molecules across it, but prevents the pas-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1059Dialysis, kidney\nHemodialyzer (where \nfiltering takes place)\nHemodialysis machine\nBlood flows \nto dialyzer\nCleansed blood \nflows back to body\nHemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed type of dialysis treatment in the United States.This treatment involves circu-\nlating the patient’s blood outside of the body through a dialysis circuit.The blood is filtered and cleansed inside the hemodia -\nlyzer and returned to the body. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group. )sage of other, larger molecules. As blood is pushed\nthrough the blood compartment in one direction, suctionor vacuum pressure pulls the dialysate through thedialysate compartment in a countercurrent, or oppositedirection. These opposing pressures work to drain excessfluids out of the bloodstream and into the dialysate, aprocess called ultrafiltration.\nA second process called diffusion moves waste\nproducts in the blood across the membrane into thedialysate compartment, where they are carried out of thebody. At the same time, electrolytes and other chemicalsKEY TERMS\nAccess site —The vein tapped for vascular access\nin hemodialysis treatments. For patients with tem-porary treatment needs, access to the bloodstreamis gained by inserting a catheter into the subcla-vian vein near the patient’s collarbone. Patients inlong-term dialysis require stronger, more durableaccess sites, called fistulas or grafts, that are surgi-cally-created.\nDialysate —A chemical bath used in dialysis to\ndraw fluids and toxins out of the bloodstream andsupply electrolytes and other chemicals to thebloodstream.\nDialysis prescription —The general parameters of\ndialysis treatment that vary according to eachpatient’s individual needs. Treatment length, typeof dialyzer and dialysate used, and rate of ultrafil-tration are all part of the dialysis prescription.\nDialyzer —An artificial kidney usually composed\nof hollow fiber that is used in hemodialysis toeliminate waste products from the blood andremove excess fluids from the bloodstream.\nErythropoietin —A hormone produced by the kid-\nneys that stimulates the production of red bloodcells by bone marrow.\nESRD —End-stage renal disease; chronic or perma-\nnent kidney failure.\nExtracorporeal circuit (ECC) —The path the\nhemodialysis patient’s blood takes outside of thebody. It typically consists of plastic tubing, ahemodialysis machine, and a dialyzer.\nHematocrit (Hct) level —A measure of red blood\ncells.\nPeritoneum —The abdominal cavity; the peri-\ntoneum acts as a blood filter in peritoneal dialysis.in the dialysate solution cross the membrane into the\nblood compartment. The purified, chemically-balancedblood is then returned to the body.\nMost hemodialysis patients require treatment three\ntimes a week, for an average of three to four hours perdialysis “run.” Specific treatment schedules depend onthe type of dialyzer used and the patient’s current physi-cal condition. While the treatment prescription and regi-men is usually overseen by a nephrologist (a doctor thatspecializes in the kidney), dialysis treatments are typical-ly administered by a nurse or patient care technician inoutpatient clinics known as dialysis centers, or in hospi-tal-based dialysis units. In-home hemodialysis treatmentis also an option for some patients, although access tothis type of treatment may be limited by financial andlifestyle factors. An investment in equipment is requiredand another person in the household should be availablefor support and assistance with treatments.\nPeritoneal dialysis\nIn peritoneal dialysis, the patient’s peritoneum, or lin-\ning of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter. A catheter is sur-gically inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During treat-ment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity withdialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move from thepatient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solution. After awaiting period of six to 24 hours, depending on the treat-ment method used, the waste-filled dialysate is drainedfrom the abdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate.\nThere are three types of peritoneal dialysis:\n• Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A\ncontinuous treatment that is self-administered andrequires no machine. The patient inserts fresh dialysatesolution into the abdominal cavity, waits four to sixhours, and removes the used solution. The solution isimmediately replaced with fresh dialysate. A bagattached to the catheter is worn under clothing.\n• Continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). An\novernight treatment that uses a machine to drain andrefill the abdominal cavity, CCPD takes 10–12 hoursper session.\n• Intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD). This hospital-\nbased treatment is performed several times a week. Amachine administers and drains the dialysate solution,and sessions can take up to 24 hours.\nPeritoneal dialysis is often the treatment option of\nchoice in infants and children, whose small size canmake vascular (through a vein) access difficult to main-tain. Peritoneal dialysis can also be done outside of aclinical setting, which is more conducive to regularschool attendance.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1060Dialysis, kidneyPreparation\nPatients are weighed immediately before and after\neach hemodialysis treatment to assess their fluid reten-tion. Blood pressure and temperature are taken and thepatient is assessed for physical changes since their lastdialysis run. Regular blood tests monitor chemical andwaste levels in the blood. Prior to treatment, patients aretypically administered a dose of heparin, an anticoagu-lant that prevents blood clotting, to ensure the free flowof blood through the dialyzer and an uninterrupted dialy-sis run for the patient.\nAftercare\nBoth hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients\nneed to be vigilant about keeping their access sites andcatheters clean and infection-free during and betweendialysis runs.\nDialysis is just one facet of a comprehensive treat-\nment approach for ESRD. Although dialysis treatment isvery effective in removing toxins and fluids from thebody, there are several functions of the kidney it cannotmimic, such as regulating high blood pressure and redblood cell production. Patients with ESRD need to watchtheir diet and fluid intake carefully and take medicationsas prescribed to manage their disease.\nRisks\nMany of the risks and side effects associated with\ndialysis are a combined result of both the treatment andthe poor physical condition of the ESRD patient. Dialy-sis patients should always report side effects to theirhealthcare provider.\nAnemia\nHematocrit (Hct) levels, a measure of red blood\ncells, are typically low in ESRD patients. This deficiencyis caused by a lack of the hormone erythropoietin, whichis normally produced by the kidneys. The problem is ele-vated in hemodialysis patients, who may incur blood lossduring hemodialysis treatments. Epoetin alfa, or EPO(sold under the trade name Epogen), a hormone therapy,and intravenous or oral iron supplements are used tomanage anemia in dialysis patients.\nCramps, nausea, vomiting, and headaches\nSome hemodialysis patients experience cramps and\nflu-like symptoms during treatment. These can be causedby a number of factors, including the type of dialysateused, composition of the dialyzer membrane, water qual-ity in the dialysis unit, and the ultrafiltration rate of thetreatment. Adjustment of the dialysis prescription often\nhelps alleviate many symptoms.\nHypotension\nBecause of the stress placed on the cardiovascular\nsystem with regular hemodialysis treatments, patients areat risk for hypotension , a sudden drop in blood pressure.\nThis can often be controlled by medication and adjust-ment of the patient’s dialysis prescription.\nInfection\nBoth hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients\nare at risk for infection. Hemodialysis patients shouldkeep their access sites clean and watch for signs of red-ness and warmth that could indicate infection. Peritonealdialysis patients must follow the same precautions withtheir catheter. Peritonitis , an infection of the peritoneum,\ncauses flu-like symptoms and can disrupt dialysis treat-ments if not caught early.\nInfectious diseases\nBecause there is a great deal of blood exposure\ninvolved in dialysis treatment, a slight risk of contractinghepatitis B and hepatitis C exists. The hepatitis B vacci-\nnation is recommended for most hemodialysis patients.\nAs of 1997, there has only been one documented case ofHIV being transmitted in a United States dialysis unit toa staff member, and no documented cases of HIV everbeing transmitted between dialysis patients in the UnitedStates. The strict standards of infection control practiced\nin modern hemodialysis units makes the chance of con-tracting one of these diseases very small.\nNormal results\nPuffiness in the patient related to edema , or fluid\nretention, may be relieved after dialysis treatment. Thepatient’s overall sense of physical well-being may alsobe improved. Because dialysis is an ongoing treatmentprocess for many patients, a baseline for normalcy can bedifficult to gauge.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBock, G. H., E. J. Ruley, and M. P. Moore.

    "title": "Diaper rash",
    "content": "Diaper rash\nDefinition\nDermatitis of the buttocks, genitals, lower abdomen,\nor thigh folds of an infant or toddler is commonly referredto as diaper rash.\nDescription\nThe outside layer of skin normally forms a protec-\ntive barrier that prevents infection. One of the primarycauses of dermatitis in the diaper area is prolonged skincontact with wetness. Under these circumstances, naturaloils are stripped away, the outer layer of skin is damaged,and there is increased susceptibility to infection by bacte-ria or yeast.\nDiaper rash is a term that covers a broad variety of\nskin conditions that occur on the same area of the body.Some babies are more prone to diaper rash than others.\nCauses and symptoms\nFrequently a flat, red rash is caused by simple chaf-\ning of the diaper against tender skin, initiating a frictionrash. This type of rash is not seen in the skin folds. It maybe more pronounced around the edges of the diaper, atthe waist and leg bands. The baby generally doesn’tappear to experience much discomfort. Sometimes thechemicals or detergents in the diaper are contributingfactors and may result in contact dermatitis . These\nrashes should clear up easily with proper attention.\nIgnoring the condition may lead to a secondary infectionthat is more difficult to resolve.\nFriction of skin against itself can cause a rash in the\nbaby’s skin folds, called intertrigo. This rash appears asreddened areas that may ooze and is often uncomfortablewhen the diaper is wet. Intertrigo can also be found onother areas of the body where there are deep skin foldsthat tend to trap moisture.\nSeborrheic dermatitis is the diaper area equivalent\nof cradle cap. It is scaly and greasy in appearance andmay be worse in the folds of the skin.\nYeast, or candidal dermatitis, is the most common\ninfectious cause of diaper rash. The affected areas areraised and quite red with distinct borders, and satellitelesions may occur around the edges. Yeast is part of thenormal skin flora, and is often an opportunistic invaderwhen simple diaper rash is untreated. It is particularlycommon after treatment with antibiotics , which kill the\ngood bacteria that normally keep the yeast population incheck. Usual treatments for diaper rash will not clear it up.Repeated or difficult to resolve episodes of yeast infectionmay warrant further medical attention, since this is some-times associated with diabetes or immune problems.\nAnother infectious cause of diaper rash is impetigo .\nThis bacterial infection is characterized by blisters thatooze and crust.\nDiagnosis\nThe presence of skin lesions in the diaper area\nmeans that the baby has diaper rash. However, there areseveral types of rash that may require specific treatment\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1062Diaper rashin order to heal. It is useful to be able to distinguish them\nby appearance as described above.\nA baby with a rash that does not clear up within two\nto three days or a rash with blisters or bleeding should beseen by a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are generally prescribed for rashes\ncaused by bacteria, particularly impetigo. This may be atopical or oral formulation, depending on the size of thearea involved and the severity of the infection.\nOver-the-counter antifungal creams, such as Lotrim-\nin, are often recommended to treat a rash resulting fromyeast. If topical treatment is not effective, an oral antifun-gal may be prescribed.\nMild steroid creams, such as 0.5–1% hydrocorti-\nsone, can be used for seborrheic dermatitis and some-times intertrigo. Prescription strength creams may beneeded for short-term treatment of more stubborn cases.\nAlternative treatment\nGood diaper hygiene will prevent or clear up many\nsimple cases of diaper rash. Diapers should be checkedvery frequently and changed as soon as they are wet orsoiled. Good air circulation is also important for healthyskin. Babies should have some time without wearing adiaper, and a waterproof pad can be used to protect thebed or other surface. Rubber pants, or other occlusive fab-rics, should not be used over the diaper area. Some cloth-like disposable diapers promote better air circulation thanplastic-type diapers. It may be necessary for mothers toexperiment with diaper types to see if the baby’s skinreacts better to cloth or disposable ones. If disposable dia-pers are used, the baby’s skin may react differently to var-ious brands. If the baby is wearing cloth diapers, theyshould be washed in a mild detergent and double rinsed.\nThe diaper area should be cleaned with something\nmild, even plain water. Some wipes contain alcohol orchemicals that can be irritating for some babies. Plainwater may be the best cleansing substance when there isa rash. Using warm water in a spray bottle (or giving aquick bath) and then lightly patting the skin dry can pro-duce less skin trauma than using wipes. In the event ofsuspected yeast, a tablespoon of cider vinegar can beadded to a cup of warm water and used as a cleansingsolution. This is dilute enough that it should not burn, butacidifies the skin pH enough to hamper the yeast growth.\nBarrier ointments can be valuable to treat rashes.\nThose that contain zinc oxide are especially effective.These creams and ointments protect already irritated skinfrom the additional insult of urine and stool, particularly\nif the baby has diarrhea . Cornstarch powder may be\nused on rashes that are moist, such as impetigo.\nNutrition\nWhat the baby eats can make a difference in stool fre-\nquency and acidity. Typically, breast-fed babies will havefewer problems with rashes. When adding a new food tothe diet, the baby should be observed closely to seewhether rashes are produced around the baby’s mouth oranus. If this occurs, the new food should be discontinued.\nBabies who are taking antibiotics are more likely to\nget rashes due to yeast. To help bring the good bacterialcounts back to normal, Lactobacillus bifidus can be\nadded to the diet. It is available in powder form frommost health food stores.\nHerbal treatment\nSome herbal preparations can be useful for diaper\nrash. Calendula reduces inflammation, tightens tissues,and disinfects. It has been recommended for seborrheicdermatitis as well as for general inflammation of theskin. The ointment should be applied at each diaperchange. Chickweed ointment can also be soothing forirritated skin and may be applied once or twice daily.\nPrognosis\nTreated appropriately, diaper rash will resolve fairly\nquickly if there is no underlying health problem or skindisease.\nPrevention\nFrequent diaper changes are important to keep the\nskin dry and healthy. Application of powders and oint-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1063Diaper rash\nBaby with severe diaper rash.

    "content": "Diaphragm (birth control)\nDefinition\nDiaphragms are dome-shaped barrier methods of\ncontraception that block sperm from entering the uterus.\nThey are made of latex (rubber) and formed like a shal-low cup. Since vaginas vary in size, each patient willneed to be fitted by a doctor or nurse with a diaphragmthat conforms to the shape and contour of the vagina aswell as the strength of the muscles in the vaginal walls.Diaphragms must be used with spermicidal cream orjelly. The device should cause no discomfort, and neitherthe woman nor her partner should feel that it is there.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a diaphragm is to prevent access to\nthe womb (uterus) by the sperm and thus prevent concep-tion. The level of effectiveness is about 95%.\nPrecautions\nEach client will undergo a physical examination and\na Pap smear. If these are normal, the physician will fit thepatient for the device and give instructions on how toinsert, remove, and clean the object. She will also betaught the signs and symptoms of potential complications.KEY TERMS\nDermatitis —Inflammation of the skin.Description\nPrior to insertion, the inside of the dome and the rim\nare covered with a thick layer (perhaps a tablespoon) of aspermicide that is compatible with the diaphragm beingused. The domed area covers the opening into the uterus(cervix) and keeps the spermicide in place. As a result,any sperm that might get under the diaphragm will bedestroyed.\nDiaphragms may be inserted two to three hours prior\nto intercourse, and must be left in place for six to eighthours following sexual relations. During this time thewoman may not swim, bathe, or douche, but she mayshower. If she desires to have intercourse again beforethe six to eight hours have passed, the diaphragm shouldnot be removed. Instead, an applicator full of spermicideshould be deposited into the vagina.\nA diaphragm will last for a year or more. It should\nbe examined weekly for holes. This can be done by hold-ing it up to the light or filling it with water.\nPreparation\nBefore inserting the diaphragm, the woman should\nempty her bladder and wash her hands with soap andwater. The device should be checked for leaks by fillingit with water or holding it up to the light. A spermicidaljelly is then applied to the inside and outside, and espe-cially around the rim. While standing with one foot ele-vated on a chair or step, lying down, or squatting, thewoman folds the diaphragm inward toward the middleand inserts it into the vagina as far as it will go.\nAftercare\nWhen removed, the diaphragm should be washed\nwith a mild soap and water. After being dried, it can bedusted with corn starch before being returned to its con-tainer. The diaphragm should always be stored awayfrom sunlight and heat in a cool, dry place. It should notbe washed with harsh or perfumed soaps or used withperfumed powders because either of these substances candamage the diaphragm.\nRisks\nAlthough rare, wearing the diaphragm longer than\nthe recommended time can result in toxic shock syn-\ndrome . The signs and symptoms of this serious illness\ninclude sudden onset of high fever , vomiting, diarrhea ,\ndizziness , faintness, weakness, aching muscles and\njoints, and rash. The doctor must be notified immediatelyif any of these conditions appear. An allergic reaction tothe spermicide or the material from which the device is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1064Diaphragm (birth control)made is also possible. Diaphragm use is also associated\nwith an increased risk of bladder infections.\nIt should be noted that the diaphragm can become\ndislodged during intercourse, which could result in anunwanted pregnancy . To ensure a secure fit, a woman\nshould be examined for a refitting if she gains or losesmore than 10 lbs (4.5 kg), or after she gives birth.\nNormal results\nConsumers can expect an efficiency rate of about\n95% in preventing pregnancy. Using a male condom in\nconjunction with the diaphragm decreases the potentialfor pregnancy. Diaphragms provide no protection againstAIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases .\nResources\nBOOKS\nDickason, Elizabeth Jean, Bonnie Lang Silverman, and Judith\nA. Kaplan.

Barstow, RN\nDiaphragmatic hernia seeHerniaKEY TERMS\nSpermicide —A substance that kills sperm.\nToxic shock syndrome —An uncommon, but poten-\ntially fatal, disease that has been associated with theuse of diaphragms and vaginal tampons. The symp-toms include high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.Diarrhea\nDefinition\nTo most individuals, diarrhea means an increased\nfrequency or decreased consistency of bowel move-ments; however, the medical definition is more exactthan this. In many developed countries, the average num-ber of bowel movements is three per day. However,researchers have found that diarrhea best correlates withan increase in stool weight; stool weights above 10 oz(300 g) per day generally indicates diarrhea. This ismainly due to excess water, which normally makes up60–85% of fecal matter. In this way, true diarrhea is dis-tinguished from diseases that cause only an increase inthe number of bowel movements (hyperdefecation), orincontinence (involuntary loss of bowel contents).\nDiarrhea is also classified by physicians into acute,\nwhich lasts one to two weeks, and chronic, which contin-ues for longer than 23 weeks. Viral and bacterial infec-tions are the most common causes of acute diarrhea.\nDescription\nIn many cases, acute infectious diarrhea is a mild,\nlimited annoyance. However, worldwide acute infectiousdiarrhea has a huge impact, causing over five milliondeaths per year. While most deaths are among childrenunder five years of age in developing nations, the impact,even in developed countries, is considerable. For exam-ple, over 250,000 individuals are admitted to hospitals inthe United States each year because of one of theseepisodes. Rapid diagnosis and proper treatment can pre-vent much of the suffering associated with these devas-tating illnesses.\nChronic diarrhea also has a considerable effect on\nhealth, as well as on social and economic well being.Patients with celiac disease , inflammatory bowel dis-\nease, and other prolonged diarrheal illnesses developnutritional deficiencies that diminish growth and immu-nity. They affect social interaction and result in the lossof many working hours.\nCauses and symptoms\nDiarrhea occurs because more fluid passes through\nthe large intestine (colon) than that organ can absorb. Asa rule, the colon can absorb several times more fluid thanis required on a daily basis. However, when this reservecapacity is overwhelmed, diarrhea occurs.\nDiarrhea is caused by infections or illnesses that\neither lead to excess production of fluids or preventabsorption of fluids. Also, certain substances in the colon,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1065Diarrheasuch as fats and bile acids, can interfere with water\nabsorption and cause diarrhea. In addition, rapid passageof material through the colon can also do the same.\nSymptoms related to any diarrheal illness are often\nthose associated with any injury to the gastrointestinaltract, such as fever , nausea, vomiting, and abdominal\npain . All or none of these may be present depending on\nthe disease causing the diarrhea. The number of bowelmovements can vary—up to 20 or more per day. In somepatients, blood or pus is present in the stool. Bowelmovements may be difficult to flush (float) or containundigested food material.\nThe most common causes of acute diarrhea are\ninfections (the cause of traveler’s diarrhea ),food\npoisoning , and medications. Medications are a fre-\nquent and often over-looked cause, especially antibi-\notics and antacids . Less often, various sugar free\nfoods, which sometimes contain poorly absorbablematerials, cause diarrhea.\nChronic diarrhea is frequently due to many of the\nsame things that cause the shorter episodes (infections,medications, etc.); symptoms just last longer. Someinfections can become chronic. This occurs mainly withparasitic infections (such as Giardia ) or when patients\nhave altered immunity ( AIDS ).\nThe following are the more usual causes of chronic\ndiarrhea:\n• AIDS\n• colon cancer and other bowel tumors\n• endocrine or hormonal abnormalities (thyroid, diabetes\nmellitus , etc.)\n• food allergy• inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn’s disease and\nulcerative colitis )\n• lactose intolerance• malabsorption syndromes (celiac and Whipple’s dis-\nease)\n• other (alcohol, microscopic colitis, radiation, surgery)\nComplications\nThe major effects of diarrhea are dehydration ,mal-\nnutrition , and weight loss. Signs of dehydration can be\nhard to notice, but increasing thirst, dry mouth , weak-\nness or lightheadedness (particularly if worsening onstanding), or a darkening/decrease in urination are sug-gestive. Severe dehydration leads to changes in thebody’s chemistry and could become life-threatening.Dehydration from diarrhea can result in kidney failure,neurological symptoms, arthritis, and skin problems.Diagnosis\nMost cases of acute diarrhea never need diagnosis or\ntreatment, as many are mild and produce few problems.But patients with fever over 102°F (38.9°C), signs ofdehydration, bloody bowel movements, severe abdomi-nal pain, known immune disease, or prior use of antibi-otics need prompt medical evaluation.\nWhen diagnostic studies are needed, the most use-\nful are stool culture and examination for parasites;\nhowever these are often negative and a cause cannot befound in a large number of patients. The earlier cul-tures are performed, the greater the chance of obtain-ing a positive result. For those with a history of antibi-otic use in the preceding two months, stool samplesneed to be examined for the toxins that cause antibiot-\nic-associated colitis . Tests are also available to check\nstool samples for microscopic amounts of blood andfor cells that indicate severe inflammation of the colon.Examination with an endoscope is sometimes helpfulin determining severity and extent of inflammation.Tests to check changes in blood chemistry (potassium,magnesium, etc.) and a complete blood count (CBC)\nare also often performed.\nChronic diarrhea is quite different, and most patients\nwith this condition will receive some degree of testing.Many exams are the same as for an acute episode, assome infections and parasites cause both types of diar-rhea. A careful history to evaluate medication use,dietary changes, family history of illnesses, and othersymptoms is necessary. Key points in determining theseriousness of symptoms are weight loss of over 10 lb(4.5 kg), blood in the stool, and nocturnal diarrhea(symptoms that awaken the patient from sleep).\nBoth prescription and over-the-counter medications\ncan contain additives, such as lactose and sorbitol, thatwill produce diarrhea in sensitive individuals. Review ofallergies or skin changes may also point to a cause.\nSocial history may indicate if stress is playing a role or\nidentify activities which can be associated with diarrhea(for example, diarrhea that occurs in runners).\nA combination of stool, blood, and urine tests may\nbe needed in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea; in addi-tion a number of endoscopic and x-ray studies are fre-quently required.\nTreatment\nTreatment is ideally directed toward correcting the\ncause; however, the first aim should be to prevent or treatdehydration and nutritional deficiencies. The type offluid and nutrient replacement will depend on whetheroral feedings can be taken and the severity of fluid loss-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1066Diarrheaes. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids\nare the choices; ORS is preferred if possible.\nA physician should be notified if the patient is dehy-\ndrated, and if oral replacement is suggested then com-mercial (Pedialyte and others) or homemade preparationscan be used. The World Health Organization (WHO) hasprovided this easy recipe for home preparation, whichcan be taken in small frequent sips:\n• Table salt—3/4 tsp• Baking powder—1 tsp\n• Orange juice—1 c\n• Water—1 qt (1 L)\nWhen feasible, food intake should be continued even\nin those with acute diarrhea. A physician should be con-sulted as to what type and how much food is permitted.\nAnti-motility agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate)\nare useful for those with chronic symptoms; their use islimited or even contraindicated in most individuals withacute diarrhea, especially in those with high fever orbloody bowel movements. They should not be takenwithout the advice of a physician.\nOther treatments are available, depending on the\ncause of symptoms. For example, the bulk agent psylli-um helps some patients by absorbing excess fluid andsolidifying stools; cholestyramine, which binds bileacids, is effective in treating bile salt induced diarrhea.Low fat diets or more easily digestible fat is useful in\nsome patients. New antidiarrheal drugs that decrease\nexcessive secretion of fluid by the intestinal tract isanother approach for some diseases. Avoidance of med-ications or other products that are known to cause diar-rhea (such as lactose) is curative in some, but should bediscussed with a physician.\nAlternative treatment\nIt is especially important to find the cause of diar-\nrhea, since stopping diarrhea when it is the body’s way ofeliminating something foreign is not helpful and can beharmful in the long run.\nOne effective alternative approach to preventing and\ntreating diarrhea involves oral supplementation ofaspects of the normal flora in the colon with the yeastsLactobacillus acidophilus ,L. bifidus , or Saccharomyces\nboulardii . In clinical settings, these “biotherapeutic”\nagents have repeatedly been helpful in the resolution ofdiarrhea, especially antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Theireffectiveness is also supported by the results of aresearch study published in the Journal of the American\nMedical Association in 1996.KEY TERMS\nAnti-motiltiy medications —Medications such as\nloperamide (Imodium), diphenoxylate (Lomotil),or medications containing codeine or narcoticsthat decrease the ability of the intestine to con-tract. These can worsen the condition of a patientwith dysentery or colitis.\nColitis —Inflammation of the colon.\nEndoscope —An endoscope, as used in the field of\ngastroenterology, is a thin flexible tube that uses alens or miniature camera to view various areas ofthe gastrointestinal tract. Both diagnosis, throughbiopsies or other means, and therapeutic proce-dures can be done with this instrument.\nEndoscopy —The performance of an exam using\nan endoscope is known generally as endoscopy.\nLactose intolerance —An inability to properly\ndigest milk and dairy products.\nOral rehydration solution (ORS) —A liquid prepa-\nration developed by the World Health Organiza-tion that can decrease fluid loss in persons withdiarrhea. Originally developed to be preparedwith materials available in the home, commercialpreparations have recently come into use.\nSteatorrhea —Excessive amounts of fat in the feces.\nNutrient replacement also plays a role in preventing\nand treating episodes of diarrhea. Zinc especially appearsto have an effect on the immune system, and deficiencyof this mineral can lead to chronic diarrhea. Also, zincreplacement improves growth in young patients. Plentyof fluids, especially water, should be taken by individualssuffering from diarrhea to prevent dehydration. TheBRAT diet also can be useful in helping to resolve diar-rhea. This diet limits food intake to bananas, rice, apple-sauce, and toast. These foods provide soluble and insolu-ble fiber without irritation. If the toast is slightly burnt,the charcoal can help sequester toxins and pull themfrom the body.\nAcute homeopathic remedies can be very effective for\ntreating diarrhea especially in infants and young children.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis is related to the cause of the diarrhea; for\nmost individuals in developed countries, a bout of acute,infectious diarrhea is at best uncomfortable. However, in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1067Diarrheaboth industrialized and developing areas, serious compli-\ncations and death can occur.\nFor those with chronic symptoms, an extensive num-\nber of tests are usually necessary to make a proper diag-nosis and begin treatment; a specific diagnosis is foundin 90% of patients. In some, however, no specific causeis found and only treatment with bulk agents or anti-motility agents is indicated.\nPrevention\nProper hygiene and food handling techniques will\nprevent many cases. Traveler’s diarrhea can be avoidedby use of Pepto-Bismol and/or antibiotics, if necessary.The most important action is to prevent the complica-tions of dehydration.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFine, Kenneth D. “Diarrhea.” In Sleisenger & Fordtran’s Gas-\ntrointestinal and Liver Disease , ed.

    "content": "Diets\nDefinition\nHumans may alter their usual eating habits for many\nreasons, including weight loss, disease prevention ortreatment, removing toxins from the body, or to achieve ageneral improvement in physical and mental health. Oth-ers adopt special diets for religious reasons. In the caseof some vegetarians and vegans, dietary changes aremade out of ethical concerns for the rights of animals.\nPurpose\nPeople who are moderately to severely overweight\ncan derive substantial health benefits from a weight-lossdiet. A weight reduction of just 10–20 (4.5–9.1 kg) canresult in reduced cholesterol levels and lower blood pres-sure. Weight-related health problems include heart dis-ease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high levels ofblood sugar and cholesterol.\nIn individuals who are not overweight, dietary\nchanges may also be useful in the prevention or treat-ment of a range of ailments including acquired immun-odeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ),cancer ,osteoporosis ,\ninflammatory bowel disease, chronic pulmonary disease,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1068Dietsrenal disease, Parkinson’s disease , seizure disorders,\nand food allergies and intolerances.\nDescription\nOrigins\nThe practice of altering diet for special reasons\nhas existed since antiquity. For example, Judaism hasincluded numerous dietary restrictions for thousandsof years. One ancient Jewish sect, the Essenes, is saidto have developed a primitive detoxification diet\naimed at preparing the bodies, minds, and spirits of itsmembers for the coming of a “messiah” who woulddeliver them from their Roman captors. Preventativeand therapeutic diets became quite popular during thelate twentieth century. Books promoting the latestdietary plan continue to make the bestseller lists,although not all of the information given is consideredauthoritative.\nThe idea of a healthful diet is to provide all of the\ncalories and nutrients needed by the body for optimalperformance, at the same time ensuring that neithernutritional deficiencies nor excesses occur. Diet plansthat claim to accomplish those objectives are so numer-ous they are virtually uncountable. These diets employ a\nvariety of approaches, including the following:\n• Fixed-menu: Offers little choice to the dieter. Specifies\nexactly which foods will be consumed. Easy to follow,but may be considered “boring” to some dieters.\n• Formula: Replaces some or all meals with a nutritional-\nly balanced liquid formula or powder.\n• Exchange-type: Allows the dieter to choose between\nselected foods from each food group.\n• Flexible: Doesn’t concern itself with the overall diet,\nsimply with one aspect such as fat or energy.\nDiets may also be classified according to the types\nof foods they allow. For example, an omnivorous dietconsists of both animal and plant foods, whereas a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet permits no animal flesh, but doesinclude eggs, milk, and dairy products. A vegan diet is astricter form of vegetarianism in which eggs, cheese,\nand other milk products are prohibited.\nA third way of classifying diets is according to their\npurpose: religious, weight-loss, detoxification, lifestyle-related, or aimed at prevention or treatment of a specificdisease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1069Diets\nFats, oils, sweets\n(use sparingly)\nMilk, yogurt, cheese\n(2–3 servingsper day)\nVegetables\n(3–5 servings per day)\nBread, rice, cereal, pasta\n(6–11 servings per day)Meat, poultry, fish,\neggs, beans, nuts(2–3) servings per day)\nFruits\n(2–4 servings per day)\nCereal\nBreadMILK\nSuggested daily food servings. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Precautions\nDieters should be cautious about plans that severely\nrestrict the size of food portions, or that eliminate entirefood groups from the diet. It is highly probable that theywill become discouraged and drop out of such programs.The best diet is one that can be maintained indefinitelywithout ill effects, that offers sufficient variety and bal-ance to provide everything needed for good health, andthat is considerate of personal food preferences.\nLow-fat diets are not recommended for children\nunder the age of two. Young children need extra fat tomaintain their active, growing bodies. Fat intake may begradually reduced between the ages of two and five, afterwhich it should be limited to a maximum of 30% of totalcalories through adulthood. Saturated fat should berestricted to no more than 10% of total calories.\nWeight-loss dieters should be wary of the “yo-yo”\neffect that occurs when numerous attempts are made toreduce weight using high-risk, quick-fix diets. This con-tinued “cycling” between weight loss and weight gaincan slow the basal metabolic rate and can sometimes leadto eating disorders. The dieter may become discouragedand frustrated by this success/failure cycle. The endresult of “yo-yo” dieting is that it becomes more difficultto maintain a healthy weight.\nCaution should also be exercised about weight-loss\ndiets that require continued purchases of special prepack-aged foods. Not only do these tend to be costly and over-processed, they may also prevent dieters from learningthe food-selection and preparation skills essential tomaintenance of weight loss. Further, dieters should con-sider whether they want to carry these special foods towork, restaurants, or homes of friends.\nConcern has been expressed about weight-loss diet\nplans that do not include exercise , considered essential\nto long-term weight management. Some diets and sup-plements may be inadvisable for patients with specialconditions or situations.\nCertain fad diets purporting to be official diets of\ngroups such as the American Heart Association and theMayo Clinic are in no way endorsed by those institu-tions. Patients thinking of starting such a diet shouldcheck with the institution to ensure its name has not beenmisappropriated by an unscrupulous practitioner.\nSide effects\nA wide range of side effects (some quite serious) can\nresult from special diets, especially those that are nutri-tionally unbalanced. Further problems can arise if thedieter is taking high doses of dietary supplements. Foodis essential to life, and improper nutrition can result in\nserious illness or death .\nResearch and general acceptance\nIt is agreed among traditional and complementary\npractitioners that many patients could substantially bene-fit from improved eating habits. Specialized diets haveproved effective against a wide variety of conditions anddiseases. However, dozens of unproved but widely publi-cized “fad diets” emerge each year, prompting wide-spread concerns about their usefulness, cost to the con-sumer, and their safety.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Dietetic Association. 216 West Jackson Blvd.,\nChicago, IL 60606-6995.

    "title": "Diffuse esophageal spasm",
    "content": "Diffuse esophageal spasm\nDefinition\nDiffuse esophageal spasm is a term used to define an\nuncoordinated or spastic esophagus.\nDescription\nThe esophagus is a muscular tube that actively trans-\nports food from the throat to the stomach by rhythmiccontractions known as peristalsis. The actual mechanismand anatomy are quite complex, involving three distinctsegments and allowing a person to swallow even whenupside-down. Diffuse esophageal spasm describes a con-dition where the entire esophagus is spastic—along itsentire length, the muscular activity is increased anduncoordinated. The name corkscrew esophagus describesperfectly the appearance of this disorder on x rays.\nX rays may reveal a slightly different appearance\nand result in the designation rosary bead esophagus, butthe cause is still diffuse spasm, and the two entitiesbehave in the same way.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause appears to be disruption of the complex\nsystem of nerves that coordinates the muscular activity.The result is difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and pain\nthat feels like a heart attack and can involve the entire\nchest, jaw, and arms.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1070Diffuse esophageal spasmDiagnosis\nSwallowing problems usually call for esopha-\ngograms. In the x ray department, the patient is given acontrast agent to drink. During swallowing, x rays recordthe passage of the agent down the esophagus and into thestomach. Instead of a straight tube with well-coordinatedwaves of contraction, the resulting x rays show awrithing organ resembling a giant corkscrew.\nAnother test that is used in many disorders of\nesophageal motility is manometry. Pressures inside theesophagus are measured every inch or so using a balloondevice that is passed all the way down to the stomach.The result is a precise record of its activity that yields aspecific diagnosis.\nTreatment\nSoft and liquid foods pass more easily than solid\npieces. Medications of several types are helpful—nifedipine, hydralazine, isoproterenol, and nitrates beingthe most successful. Several other treatments have uncer-tain results. For severe cases, relief is obtained two-thirdsof the time by cutting the muscles along the entire lengthof the esophagus. This is a major surgical procedure.\nPrognosis\nThis condition does not go away, nor is treatment\nentirely satisfactory. Patients need to be careful of whatthey eat and continue on medication if a beneficial one isfound. Fortunately, the condition does not get progres-sively worse as time passes.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med-\nicine. Philadelphia: W. B.

    "content": "DiGeorge syndrome\nDefinition\nDiGeorge syndrome (also called congenital thymic\nhypoplasia, or third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syn-drome) is a birth defect that is caused by an abnormalchromosome and affects the baby’s immune system. Thesyndrome is marked by absence or underdevelopment ofthe thymus and parathyroid glands. It is named for thepediatrician who first described it in 1965.\nDescription\nThe prevalence of DiGeorge syndrome is debated;\nthe estimates range from 1:4000 to 1:6395. Becausethe symptoms caused by the chromosomal abnormalityvary somewhat from patient to patient, the syndromeprobably occurs much more often than was previouslythought. DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes describedas one of the “CATCH 22” disorders, so namedbecause of their characteristics—cardiac defects,abnormal facial features, thymus underdevelopment,cleft palate, and hypocalcemia—caused by a deletionof several genes in chromosome 22. The specific facialfeatures associated with DiGeorge syndrome includelow-set ears, wide-set eyes, a small jaw, and a shortgroove in the upper lip. The male/female ratio is 1:1.The syndrome appears to be equally common in allracial and ethnic groups.\nCauses and symptoms\nDiGeorge syndrome is caused either by inheritance\nof a defective chromosome 22 or by a new defect in chro-mosome 22 in the fetus. The type of defect that isinvolved is called deletion. A deletion occurs when thegenetic material in the chromosomes does not recombineproperly during the formation of sperm or egg cells. Thedeletion means that several genes from chromosome 22are missing in DiGeorge syndrome patients. Accordingto a 1999 study, 6% of children with DiGeorge syndromeinherited the deletion from a parent, while 94% had anew deletion. Other conditions that are associated with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1071DiGeorge syndromeDiGeorge syndrome are diabetes (a condition where the\npancreas no longer produces enough insulin) in themother and fetal alcohol syndrome (a pattern of birth\ndefects and learning and behavioral problems affecting\nindividuals whose mothers consumed alcohol duringpregnancy ).\nThe loss of the genes in the deleted material means\nthat the baby’s third and fourth pharyngeal pouches failto develop normally during the twelfth week of pregnan-cy. This developmental failure results in a completely orpartially absent thymus gland and parathyroid glands. Inaddition, 74% of fetuses with DiGeorge syndrome havesevere heart defects. The child is born with a defectiveimmune system and an abnormally low level of calciumin the blood.\nThese defects usually become apparent within 48\nhours of birth. The infant’s heart defects may lead to heart\nfailure , or there may be seizures and other evidence of a\nlow level of calcium in the blood ( hypocalcemia ).\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome can be made by\nultrasound examination around the eighteenth week ofpregnancy, when abnormalities in the development of theheart or the palate can be detected. Another techniquethat is used to diagnose the syndrome before birth iscalled fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH. Thistechnique uses DNA probes from the DiGeorge regionon chromosome 22. FISH can be performed on cell sam-ples obtained by amniocentesis as early as the fourteenth\nweek of pregnancy. It confirms about 95% of cases ofDiGeorge syndrome.\nIf the mother has not had prenatal testing, the diag-\nnosis of DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes suggested bythe child’s facial features at birth. In other cases, the doc-tor makes the diagnosis during heart surgery when he orshe notices the absence or abnormal location of the thy-mus gland. The diagnosis can be confirmed by bloodtests for calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormonelevels, and by the sheep cell test for immune function.\nTreatment\nHypocalcemia\nHypocalcemia in DiGeorge patients is unusually dif-\nficult to treat. Infants are usually given calcium and vita-min D by mouth. Severe cases have been treated bytransplantation of fetal thymus tissue or bone marrow.\nHeart defects\nInfants with life-threatening heart defects are treated\nsurgically.Defective immune function\nChildren with DiGeorge syndrome should be kept\non low-phosphorus diets and kept away from crowds or\nother sources of infection. They should not be immu-nized with vaccines made from live viruses or given cor-\nticosteroids .\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis is variable; many infants with DiGe-\norge syndrome die from overwhelming infection,seizures, or heart failure within the first year. Advancesin heart surgery indicate that the prognosis is most close-ly linked to the severity of the heart defects and the par-tial presence of the thymus gland. In most children whosurvive, the number of T cells, a type of white blood cell,in the blood rises spontaneously as they mature. Sur-vivors are likely to be mentally retarded, however, and tohave other developmental difficulties, including psychi-atric problems in later life.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended for parents of\nchildren with DiGeorge syndrome because the disordercan be detected prior to birth. Although most childrenwith DiGeorge syndrome did not inherit the chromosomedeletion from their parents, they have a 50% chance ofpassing the deletion on to their own children.\nBecause of the association between DiGeorge syn-\ndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome, pregnant womenshould avoid drinking alcoholic beverages.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Common Multiple Congenital Anomaly Syndromes.” In\nNeonatology: Management, Procedures, On-Call Prob-lems, Diseases and Drugs , ed.

    "content": "Digitalis drugs\nDefinition\nDigitalis drugs are medicines made from a type of\nfoxglove plant ( Digitalis purpurea ) that have a stimulat-\ning effect on the heart.\nPurpose\nDigitalis drugs are used to treat heart problems such\nas congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.KEY TERMS\nDeletion —A genetic abnormality in which a seg-\nment of a chromosome is lost. DiGeorge syn-drome is caused by a deletion on human chromo-some 22.\nFetal alcohol syndrome —A cluster of birth defects\nthat includes abnormal facial features and mentalretardation, caused by the mother’s consumptionof alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.\nFluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) —A tech-\nnique for diagnosing DiGeorge syndrome beforebirth by analyzing cells obtained by amniocentesiswith DNA probes. FISH is about 95% accurate.\nHypocalcemia —An abnormally low level of calci-\num in the blood.\nHypoplasia —A deficiency or underdevelopment\nof a tissue or body structure.\nT cells —A type of white blood cell produced in\nthe thymus gland. T cells are an important part ofthe immune system. Infants born with an underde-veloped or absent thymus do not have a normallevel of T cells in their blood.These medicines help make the heart stronger and more\nefficient. This, in turn, improves blood circulation andhelps relieve the swelling of the hands and ankles that iscommon in people with heart problems.\nDescription\nDigitalis drugs, also known as digitalis glycosides,\nare available only with a physician’s prescription. Theyare sold in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms.Commonly used digitalis drugs are digitoxin (Crystodi-gin) and digoxin (Lanoxin).\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage is different for each\npatient. The physician who prescribes the medicine willdetermine the correct dose. Taking exactly the rightamount of medicine and taking it exactly as directed arevery important. Never take larger or more frequent doses.During treatment with a digitalis heart medicine, thephysician will monitor blood levels of the drug and willdecide whether the dose needs to be changed. Patientsshould never change the dose of this medicine unless toldto do so by their physicians.\nPrecautions\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking digitalis\ndrugs is very important. The physician will check tomake sure the medicine is working as it should and willmake any necessary changes in dosage or in instructionsfor taking the medicine.\nPatients taking digitalis drugs should learn to take\ntheir pulse and should check it regularly while undertreatment with this medicine. Changes in pulse rate,rhythm, or force could be signs of side effects.\nDo not stop taking this medicine suddenly without\nchecking with the physician who prescribed it. Thiscould cause a serious change in heart function.\nDigitalis drugs are responsible for many accidental\npoisonings in children. Keep this medicine out of thereach of children.\nBe alert to the signs of overdose. Overdosing is a\nserious concern with digitalis drugs, because the amountof medicine that most people need to help their heartproblems is very close to the amount that can cause prob-lems from overdose. If any of these signs of overdoseoccur, check with a physician as soon as possible:\n• loss of appetite\n• nausea\n• vomiting\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1073Digitalis drugs• pain in the lower stomach\n• diarrhea• extreme tiredness or weakness• extremely slow or irregular heartbeat (or fast heartbeat\nin children)\n• blurred vision or other vision changes\n• drowsiness• confusion or depression• headache• fainting\nAnyone who is taking digitalis drugs should be sure\nto tell the health care professional in charge before hav-ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-gency treatment. Physicians may advise people takingdigitalis drugs to wear or carry medical identificationindicating that they are taking this medicine.\nPatients need to be very careful not to accidentally\ntake this medicine in place of another medicine thatlooks similar. Patients who are taking other medicines\nthat look like their digitalis medicine should ask theirpharmacists for suggestions on how to avoid mix-ups.\nAnyone who has had unusual reactions to digitalis\ndrugs in the past should let his or her physician knowbefore taking the drugs again. The physician should alsobe told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,\nor other substances.\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who\nmay become pregnant should check with their physiciansbefore using digitalis drugs.\nOlder people may be especially sensitive to the\neffects of digitalis drugs, which may increase the chanceof overdose.\nBefore using digitalis drugs, people with any of the\nfollowing medical problems should make sure theirphysicians are aware of their conditions:\n• heart disease\n• heart rhythm problems• severe lung disease\n• kidney disease\n• liver disease• thyroid disease\nSide effects\nSide effects are rare with this medicine. Check with\na physician as soon as possible if a skin rash, hives, or\nany other unusual or troublesome symptoms occur.Watch for signs of overdose.\nInteractions\nDigitalis drugs may interact with a number of other\nmedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects maybe greater. For example:\n• Taking digitalis drugs with other heart medicines,\namphetamines, or diet pills could increase the risk ofheart rhythm problems.\n• Calcium channel blockers, used to treat high blood\npressure, may cause higher than usual levels of digitalisdrugs in the body that could lead to symptoms of over-dose as covered in the above section.\n• Diuretics (water pills) or other medicines that lower the\namount of potassium in the body may increase the sideeffects of digitalis drugs.\n• Medicines that increase the amount of potassium in the\nbody may raise the risk of serious heart rhythm prob-lems when taken with digitalis drugs.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1074Digitalis drugs\nDigitalis purpurea. (Photo Researcher, Inc. Reproduced by\npermission.)• Diarrhea medicine or cholesterol-lowering drugs such as\ncholestyramine (Questran) and colestipol (Colestid) maykeep digitalis medicines from being absorbed into thebody. To prevent this problem, digitalis drugs should betaken several hours before or after taking these medicines.\nThe list above does not include every drug that may\ninteract with digitalis drugs. Be sure to check with aphysician or pharmacist before taking any other prescrip-tion or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.\nIn addition, a diet high in fiber may interfere with\nthe effects of digitalis drugs by preventing the medicinefrom being absorbed into the body. To avoid this prob-lem, eat high fiber foods (such as bran products, wholewheat bread, and fresh fruits and vegetables) severalhours before or after taking digitalis medicine.\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\nDigoxin seeDigitalis drugs; Antiarrhythmic\ndrugs"

This process ofopening the cervix is called dilation.\nOnce the cervix is dilated, the physician inserts a\nspoon-shaped surgical device called a curette into theuterus. The curette is used to scrape away the uterine lin-ing. One or more small tissue samples from the lining ofthe uterus or the cervical canal are sent for analysis bymicroscope to check for abnormal cells.\nAlthough simpler, less expensive techniques such as\na vacuum aspiration are quickly replacing the D & C as adiagnostic method, it is still often used to diagnose andtreat a number of conditions.\nPreparation\nBecause opening the cervix can be painful, sedatives\nmay be given before the procedure begins.

    "title": "Diphtheria",
    "content": "Diphtheria\nDefinition\nDiphtheria is a potentially fatal, contagious disease\nthat usually involves the nose, throat, and air passages,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1076Diphtheriabut may also infect the skin. Its most striking feature is\nthe formation of a grayish membrane covering the tonsilsand upper part of the throat.\nDescription\nLike many other upper respiratory diseases, diphthe-\nria is most likely to break out during the winter months.At one time it was a major childhood killer, but it is nowrare in developed countries because of widespreadimmunization. Since 1988, all confirmed cases in theUnited States have involved visitors or immigrants. Incountries that do not have routine immunization againstthis infection, the mortality rate varies from 1.5–25%.\nPersons who have not been immunized may get\ndiphtheria at any age. The disease is spread most often bydroplets from the coughing or sneezing of an infectedperson or carrier. The incubation period is two to sevendays, with an average of three days. It is vital to seekmedical help at once when diphtheria is suspected,because treatment requires emergency measures foradults as well as children.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe symptoms of diphtheria are caused by toxins\nproduced by the diphtheria bacillus, Corynebacterium\ndiphtheriae (from the Greek for “rubber membrane”). In\nfact, toxin production is related to infections of the bacil-lus itself with a particular bacteria virus called a phage(from bacteriophage; a virus that infects bacteria). Theintoxication destroys healthy tissue in the upper area ofthe throat around the tonsils, or in open wounds in the\nskin. Fluid from the dying cells then coagulates to formthe telltale gray or grayish green membrane. Inside themembrane, the bacteria produce an exotoxin, which is apoisonous secretion that causes the life-threateningsymptoms of diphtheria. The exotoxin is carried through-out the body in the bloodstream, destroying healthy tis-sue in other parts of the body.\nThe most serious complications caused by the exo-\ntoxin are inflammations of the heart muscle ( myocardi-\ntis) and damage to the nervous system. The risk of seri-\nous complications is increased as the time between onsetof symptoms and the administration of antitoxin increas-es, and as the size of the membrane formed increases.The myocarditis may cause disturbances in the heartrhythm and may culminate in heart failure . The symp-\ntoms of nervous system involvement can include seeingdouble (diplopia), painful or difficult swallowing, andslurred speech or loss of voice, which are all indicationsof the exotoxin’s effect on nerve functions. The exotoxinmay also cause severe swelling in the neck (“bull neck”).The signs and symptoms of diphtheria vary accord-\ning to the location of the infection:\nNasal\nNasal diphtheria produces few symptoms other than\na watery or bloody discharge. On examination, there maybe a small visible membrane in the nasal passages. Nasalinfection rarely causes complications by itself, but it is apublic health problem because it spreads the diseasemore rapidly than other forms of diphtheria.\nPharyngeal\nPharyngeal diphtheria gets its name from the phar-\nynx, which is the part of the upper throat that connectsthe mouth and nasal passages with the voice box. This isthe most common form of diphtheria, causing the charac-teristic throat membrane. The membrane often bleeds ifit is scraped or cut. It is important not to try to removethe membrane because the trauma may increase thebody’s absorption of the exotoxin. Other signs and symp-toms of pharyngeal diphtheria include mild sore throat ,\nfever of 101–102°F (38.3–38.9°C), a rapid pulse, and\ngeneral body weakness.\nLaryngeal\nLaryngeal diphtheria, which involves the voice box\nor larynx, is the form most likely to produce seriouscomplications. The fever is usually higher in this form ofdiphtheria (103–104°F or 39.4–40°C) and the patient isvery weak. Patients may have a severe cough , have diffi-\nculty breathing, or lose their voice completely. Thedevelopment of a “bull neck” indicates a high level ofexotoxin in the bloodstream. Obstruction of the airwaymay result in respiratory compromise and death .\nSkin\nThis form of diphtheria, which is sometimes called\ncutaneous diphtheria, accounts for about 33% of diphthe-ria cases. It is found chiefly among people with poorhygiene. Any break in the skin can become infected withdiphtheria. The infected tissue develops an ulcerated areaand a diphtheria membrane may form over the wound butis not always present. The wound or ulcer is slow to healand may be numb or insensitive when touched.\nDiagnosis\nBecause diphtheria must be treated as quickly as\npossible, doctors usually make the diagnosis on the basisof the visible symptoms without waiting for test results.\nIn making the diagnosis, the doctor examines the\npatient’s eyes, ears, nose, and throat in order to rule out\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1077Diphtheriaother diseases that may cause fever and sore throat, such\nas infectious mononucleosis , a sinus infection, or strep\nthroat . The most important single symptom that sug-\ngests diphtheria is the membrane. When a patient devel-ops skin infections during an outbreak of diphtheria, thedoctor will consider the possibility of cutaneous diphthe-ria and take a smear to confirm the diagnosis.\nLaboratory tests\nThe diagnosis of diphtheria can be confirmed by the\nresults of a culture obtained from the infected area. Mater-ial from the swab is put on a microscope slide and stainedusing a procedure called Gram’s stain. The diphtheriabacillus is called Gram-positive because it holds the dyeafter the slide is rinsed with alcohol. Under the micro-scope, diphtheria bacilli look like beaded rod-shaped cells,grouped in patterns that resemble Chinese characters.Another laboratory test involves growing the diphtheriabacillus on a special material called Loeffler’s medium.\nTreatment\nDiphtheria is a serious disease requiring hospital\ntreatment in an intensive care unit if the patient hasdeveloped respiratory symptoms. Treatment includes acombination of medications and supportive care:\nAntitoxin\nThe most important step is prompt administration of\ndiphtheria antitoxin, without waiting for laboratoryresults. The antitoxin is made from horse serum andworks by neutralizing any circulating exotoxin. The doc-tor must first test the patient for sensitivity to animalserum. Patients who are sensitive (about 10%) must bedesensitized with diluted antitoxin, since the antitoxin isthe only specific substance that will counteract diphthe-ria exotoxin. No human antitoxin is available for thetreatment of diphtheria.\nThe dose ranges from 20,000–100,000 units,\ndepending on the severity and length of time of symp-toms occurring before treatment. Diphtheria antitoxin isusually given intravenously.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics are given to wipe out the bacteria, to\nprevent the spread of the disease, and to protect thepatient from developing pneumonia . They are not a sub-\nstitute for treatment with antitoxin. Both adults and chil-dren may be given penicillin, ampicillin, or ery-thromycin. Erythromycin appears to be more effectivethan penicillin in treating people who are carriersbecause of better penetration into the infected area.Cutaneous diphtheria is usually treated by cleansing\nthe wound thoroughly with soap and water, and givingthe patient antibiotics for 10 days.\nSupportive care\nDiphtheria patients need bed rest with intensive\nnursing care, including extra fluids, oxygenation, andmonitoring for possible heart problems, airway blockage,or involvement of the nervous system. Patients withlaryngeal diphtheria are kept in a croup tent or high-\nhumidity environment; they may also need throat suc-tioning or emergency surgery if their airway is blocked.\nPatients recovering from diphtheria should rest at\nhome for a minimum of two to three weeks, especially ifthey have heart complications. In addition, patientsshould be immunized against diphtheria after recovery,because having the disease does not always induce anti-toxin formation and protect them from reinfection.\nPrevention of complications\nDiphtheria patients who develop myocarditis may be\ntreated with oxygen and with medications to preventirregular heart rhythms. An artificial pacemaker may beneeded. Patients with difficulty swallowing can be fedthrough a tube inserted into the stomach through thenose. Patients who cannot breathe are usually put onmechanical respirators.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the size and location of\nthe membrane and on early treatment with antitoxin; thelonger the delay, the higher the death rate. The most vul-nerable patients are children under age 15 and those whodevelop pneumonia or myocarditis. Nasal and cutaneousdiphtheria are rarely fatal.\nPrevention\nPrevention of diphtheria has four aspects:\nImmunization\nUniversal immunization is the most effective means\nof preventing diphtheria. The standard course of immu-nization for healthy children is three doses of DPT(diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) preparation given betweentwo months and six months of age, with booster dosesgiven at 18 months and at entry into school. Adultsshould be immunized at 10 year intervals with Td(tetanus-diphtheria) toxoid. A toxoid is a bacterial toxinthat is treated to make it harmless but still can induceimmunity to the disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1078DiphtheriaIsolation of patients\nDiphtheria patients must be isolated for one to\nseven days or until two successive cultures show thatthey are no longer contagious. Children placed in isola-\ntion are usually assigned a primary nurse for emotional\nsupport.\nIdentification and treatment of contacts\nBecause diphtheria is highly contagious and has a\nshort incubation period, family members and other con-tacts of diphtheria patients must be watched for symp-toms and tested to see if they are carriers. They are usual-ly given antibiotics for seven days and a booster shot ofdiphtheria/tetanus toxoid.\nReporting cases to public health authorities\nReporting is necessary to track potential epidemics,\nto help doctors identify the specific strain of diphtheria,and to see if resistance to penicillin or erythromycin hasdeveloped.KEY TERMS\nAntitoxin —An antibody against an exotoxin, usu-\nally derived from horse serum.\nBacillus —A rod-shaped bacterium, such as the\ndiphtheria bacterium.\nCarrier —A person who may harbor an organism\nwithout symptoms and may transmit it to others.\nCutaneous —Located in the skin.\nDiphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) —The standard\npreparation used to immunize children againstdiphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough.

    "title": "Discoid lupus erythematosus",
    "content": "Discoid lupus erythematosus\nDefinition\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a disease in\nwhich coin-shaped (discoid) red bumps appear on the skin.\nDescription\nThe disease called discoid lupus erythematosus only\naffects the skin, although similar discoid skin lesions can\noccur in the serious disease called systemic lupus ery-\nthematosus (SLE). Only about 10% of all patients with\nDLE will go on to develop the multi-organ disease SLE.\nThe tendency to develop DLE seems to run in fami-\nlies. Although men or women of any age can developDLE, it occurs in women three times more frequently thanin men. The typical DLE patient is a woman in her 30s.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1079Discoid lupus erythematosusCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of DLE is unknown. It is thought that\nDLE (like SLE) may be an autoimmune disorder.Autoimmune disorders are those that occur when cells\nof the immune system are misdirected against the body.Normally, immune cells work to recognize and helpdestroy foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and fungi.In autoimmune disorders, these cells mistakenly recog-nize various tissues of the body as foreign invaders, andattack and destroy these tissues. In SLE, the misdirectedimmune cells are antibodies. In DLE, the damaging cellsare believed to be a type of white blood cell called a Tlymphocyte. The injury to the skin results in inflamma-tion and the characteristic discoid lesions.\nIn DLE, the characteristic skin lesion is circular and\nraised. The reddish rash is about 5–10 mm in diameter,with the center often somewhat scaly and lighter in colorthan the darker outer ring. The surface of these lesions issometimes described as “warty.” There is rarely any itch-\ningor pain associated with discoid lesions. They tend to\nappear on the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, back, andarms. As DLE lesions heal, they leave thickened, scarredareas of skin. When the scalp is severely affected, theremay be associated hair loss ( alopecia ).\nPeople with DLE tend to be quite sensitive to the\nsun. They are more likely to get a sunburn , and the sun\nis likely to worsen their discoid lesions.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of DLE usually requires a skin biopsy . A\nsmall sample of a discoid lesion is removed, speciallyprepared, and examined under a microscope. Usually, thelesion has certain microscopic characteristics that allow itto be identified as a DLE lesion. Blood tests will notreveal the type of antibodies present in SLE, and physical\nexamination usually does not reveal anything other than\nthe skin lesions. If antibodies exist in the blood, or if othersymptoms or physical signs are found, it is possible thatthe discoid lesions are a sign of SLE rather than DLE.\nTreatment\nTreatment of DLE primarily involves the use of a\nvariety of skin creams. Sunscreens are used for protec-\ntion. Steroid creams can be applied to decrease inflamma-tion. Occasionally, small amounts of a steroid preparationwill be injected with a needle into a specific lesion.Because of their long list of side effects, steroid prepara-tions taken by mouth are avoided. Sometimes, short-termtreatment with oral steroids will be used for particularlysevere DLE outbreaks. Medications used to treat theinfectious disease malaria are often used to treat DLE.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments for DLE include eating a\nhealthy diet, low in red meat and dairy products and highin fish containing omega-3 fatty acids. These types offish include mackerel, sardines, and salmon. Following ahealthy diet is thought to decrease inflammation. Dietarysupplements believed to be helpful include vitamins B,\nC, E, and selenium. Vitamin A is also recommended toimprove DLE lesions. Constitutional homeopathic treat-ment can help heal DLE as well as help prevent it devel-oping into SLE.\nPrognosis\nFor the most part, the prognosis for people with\nDLE is excellent. While the lesions may be cosmeticallyunsightly, they are not life threatening and usually do notcause a patient to change his or her lifestyle. Only about10% of patients with DLE will go on to develop SLE.\nPrevention\nDLE cannot be prevented. Recommendations to pre-\nvent flares of DLE in patients with the disease includeavoiding exposure to sun and consistently using sun-screen.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAaseng, Nathan. Autoimmune Diseases.

    "title": "Disk removal",
    "content": "Disk removal\nDefinition\nOne of the most common types of back surgery is\ndisk removal (diskectomy), the removal of an interverte-bral disk, the flexible plate that connects any two adja-cent vertebrae in the spine. Intervertebral disks act asshock absorbers, protecting the brain and spinal cord\nfrom the impact produced by the body’s movements.\nPurpose\nAbout 150,000 Americans undergo disk removal\neach year in the United States. Removing the invertebralKEY TERMS\nAntibody —Specialized cells of the immune sys-\ntem that can recognize organisms invading thebody (like bacteria, viruses, and fungi). The anti-bodies are then able to start a complex chain ofevents designed to kill these foreign invaders.\nAutoimmune disorder —A disorder in which the\nbody’s antibodies mistake the body’s own tissuesfor foreign invaders. The immune system thenattacks and causes damage to these tissues.\nImmune system —The system of specialized organs,\nlymph nodes, and blood cells throughout the bodythat work together to defend the body against for-eign invaders (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.).disk is performed to treat back pain that has lasted at least\nsix weeks as a result of an abnormal disk and that has notresponded to conservative treatment. Surgery is also per-formed if there is pressure on the lumbosacral nerve rootsthat causes weakness or bowel or bladder disfunction.\nAs a person ages, the disks between the vertebrae\ndegenerate and dry out, and the fibers holding them inplace tear. Eventually, the disk can form a blister-likebulge, compressing nerves in the spine and causing pain.This is called a “prolapsed” (or herniated) disk. If such adisk causes muscle weakness or interferes with bladderor bowel function because it is pressing on a nerve root,immediate surgery to remove the disk may be needed.\nThe aim of the surgery is to try to relieve all pressure\non nerve roots by removing the pulpy material from thedisk, or the disk itself. If it is necessary to remove materi-al from several nearby vertebrae, the spine may becomeunsteady. In this case, the surgeon will perform a spinalfusion, removing all the disks between two or more verte-brae and roughening the bones so that the vertebrae healtogether. Bone strips taken from the patient’s leg or hipmay be used to help hold the vertebrae together. Spinalfusion decreases pain but it also decreases spinal mobility.\nPrecautions\nThe doctor will obtain x rays, neuroimaging stud-\nies, including computed tomography scan (CT scan)myelogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\nand clinical exams to determine the precise location ofthe affected disk.\nDescription\nThe surgery is done under general anaesthesia,\nwhich puts the patient to sleep and affects the wholebody. Operating on the patient’s back, the neurosurgeonor orthopedic surgeon makes an opening into the verte-bral canal, and then moves the dura and the bundle ofnerves called the “cauda equina” (horse’s tail) aside,which exposes the disk. If a portion of the disk hasmoved from between the vertebrae out into the nervecanal, it is simply removed. If the disk itself has becomefragmented and partially displaced, or not fragmentedbut bulging extensively, the surgeon will remove thebulging or displaced part of the disk and the part that liesin the space between the vertebrae.\nPreparation\nThe patient is given an injection an hour before the\nsurgery to dry up internal fluids and encourage drowsi-ness.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1081Disk removalAftercare\nAfter the operation, the patient will awaken lying\nflat and face down, and must remain this way for severaldays, changing position only to avoid bedsores . There\nmaybe slight pain or stiffness in the back area.\nPatients should sleep on a firm mattress and avoid\nbending at the waist, lifting heavy weights, or sitting inone spot for a long time (such as riding in a car).\nAfter surgery, patients can usually leave the hospital\non the fourth or fifth day. They must:\n• avoid sitting for more than 15–20 minutes\n• use a reclined chair• avoid bending, twisting, or lifting• begin gentle walking (indoors or outdoors), gradually\nincreasing\n• begin stationary biking or gentle swimming after two\nweeks\n• continue exercise for the next four weeks\n• slow down if they experience more than minor pain in\nthe back or leg\nRisks\nAll surgery carries some risk due to heart and lung\nproblems or the anesthesia itself, but this risk is generallyKEY TERMS\nDiskectomy —The surgical removal of a portion of\nan invertebral disk.\nDura —The strongest and outermost of three mem-\nbranes that protect the brain, spinal cord, andnerves of the cauda equina.\nHerniated disk —A blisterlike bulging or protrusion\nof the contents of the disk out through the fibersthat normally hold them in place. It is also called aruptured disk, slipped disk, or displaced disk.\nIntervertebral disk —Cylindrical elastic-like gel\npads that separate and join each pair of vertebraein the spine.\nLaminectomy —An operation in which the sur-\ngeon cuts through the covering of a vertebra toreach a herniated disk in order to remove it.\nVertebra —The bones that make up the back bone\n(spine).extremely small. (The risk of death from general anes-\nthesia for all types of surgery, for example, is only about1 in 1,600.)\nThe most common risk of the surgery is infection,\nwhich occurs in 1–2% of cases. Rarely, the surgery candamage nerves in the lower back or major blood vesselsin front of the disk. Occasionally, there may be someresidual paralysis of a particular leg or bladder muscle\nafter surgery, but this is the result of the disk problemthat necessitated the surgery, not the operation itself.\nWhile disk removals can relieve pain in 90% of\ncases, there are some people who do not get pain relief,depending on how long they had the condition requiringsurgery and other factors.\nNormal results\nAfter about five days, most patients can leave the\nhospital. They can resume all normal activities, includingwork, after four to six weeks of recuperation at home.\nIn properly evaluated patients, there is a very good\nchance that disk removal will be successful in easingpain. Even in patients over age 60, disk surgery has a“good to excellent” result for 87% of patients. Disksurgery can relieve both back and leg pain, but the great-est pain relief will occur with the leg pain.\nResources\nBOOKS\nWhite III, Augustus. Your Aching Back.

    "content": "Dislocations and subluxations\nDefinition\nIn medicine, the terms dislocation and subluxation\nrefer to the displacement of bones that form a joint.These conditions affecting the joint most often resultfrom trauma that causes adjoining bones to no longeralign with each other. A partial or incomplete dislocationis called a subluxation.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1082Dislocations and subluxationsDescription\nIn a healthy joint, the bones are normally held\ntogether with tough, fibrous bands called ligaments.These ligaments are attached to each bone along with afibrous sac surrounding the joint called the articular cap-sule or joint capsule. The ligaments and joint capsule arerelatively strong and nonelastic but permit movementwithin normal limits for each particular joint. In the eventof a dislocation, one of the bones making up the joint isforced out of its natural alignment from excessivestretching and tearing of the joint ligaments and capsule.Muscles and tendons surrounding the joint are usuallystretched and injured to some degree.\nCauses and symptoms\nA violent movement at the joint that exceeds normal\nlimits usually causes a joint dislocation. Although dislo-cations often result from trauma, they sometimes occuras a result of disease affecting the joint structures. In theprocess of the dislocation, there is tearing of the liga-ments and the articular capsule, which are vital structuresfor connecting the bone. Following a dislocation, thebones affected are often immobile and the affected limbmay be locked in an abnormal position; fractures are\nalso a concern with severe dislocations.\nImportant factors in recognizing a dislocation or\nsubluxation include a history of experiencing a fall orreceiving a blow in a particular joint followed by the sud-den onset of loss of function to the involved limb. Imme-diately after the dislocation, the joint almost alwaysswells significantly and feels painful when pressure isapplied (point tenderness). If trauma to the joint causingthe dislocation or subluxation is violent in nature, smallchips of bone can be torn away with the supporting struc-tures. Chronic recurrent dislocations may take placewithout severe pain because of the somewhat slack con-\ndition of the surrounding muscles and other supportingtissues. A first-time dislocation is considered and treatedas a possible fracture. Risk factors that can increase sus-ceptibility of joint dislocation and subluxation are shal-low or abnormally formed joint surfaces present at birth(congenital) and/or other diseases of ligaments and tissuearound a joint. Some infants are born with a hip disloca-tion. Both sexes and all ages are affected.\nDiagnosis\nA thorough medical history and physical exam by a\nphysician is the first step in the correct diagnosis of dis-locations and subluxations. X rays of the joint and adja-cent bones can locate and help determine the extent ofdislocated jointsTreatment\nImmediately after the dislocation, the application of\nice is helpful to control swelling and decrease pain. If thepatient needs to be transported, it is important to preventthe joint from moving ( immobilization ). At times, a cast\nor splint may be used to immobilize the joint and ensureproper alignment and healing. The treatment of realign-ing bones following a dislocation is called reduction.This may include simple maneuvers that manipulate thejoint to reposition the bones or surgical procedures torestore the joint to its normal position. A general anesthe-sia or muscle relaxant may be used to help make jointreduction possible by relaxing surrounding muscles inspasm. Acetaminophen or aspirin are sometimes used\nto control moderate pain, and narcotics may be pre-scribed by the physician if the pain is severe. Recurringdislocation may require surgical reconstruction orreplacement of the joint. It is not recommended toattempt to reset a dislocated joint outside of a medical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1083Dislocations and subluxations\nThis x ray shows the dislocation between two bones in a\nfinger. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)environment with experienced medical personnel,\nbecause a fracture may be present.\nAlternative treatment\nChiropractic care has been shown to be effective\nfor joint subluxation and dislocation, especially in thespine. Swelling can be addressed using botanical thera-pies. Bromelain, a pineapple enzyme, and tumeric ( Cur-\ncuma longa ) are the most potent botanical remedies for\nthis purpose. Acute homeopathic care with arnica ( Arni-\nca montana ) can reduce the trauma to the body. Liga-\nment and tendon strengthening can be assisted bothbotanically and homeopathically.\nPrognosis\nJoint ligaments have poor blood supply and, there-\nfore, heal slowly. This healing process continues longafter the symptoms of the dislocation injury havediminished. Once a joint has been either subluxated orcompletely dislocated, the connective tissue binding orholding it in correct alignment is stretched to such an\nextent that the joint becomes extremely vulnerable torepeated dislocations. However, this chance of recur-rent dislocation and subluxation will decrease if aproper rehabilitation program is implemented to\nstrengthen surrounding muscles of the joint. Most jointdislocations are curable with prompt treatment. Afterthe dislocation has been corrected, the joint mayrequire immobilization with a cast or sling for two toeight weeks.\nPrevention\nWhen an individual is involved in strenuous\nsports or heavy work, involved joints may be protect-ed by elastic bandage wraps, tape wraps, knee andshoulder pads, or special support stockings. Keepingthe muscles surrounding the joint strong will alsohelp prevent dislocations. Long-term problems mayalso be prevented by allowing an adequate amount oftime for an injured joint to rest and heal prior toresuming full activity.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1084Dislocations and subluxationsAnterior temporal \nmandibular dislocation\nPosterior dislocation of hip Dislocation of thumbSubcoracoid \ndislocation (shoulder)\nDislocations and subluxations refer to the displacement of bones that form a joint.

    "title": "Dissociative disorders",
    "content": "Dissociative disorders\nDefinition\nThe dissociative disorders are a group of mental dis-\norders that affect consciousness are defined as causingsignificant interference with the patient’s general func-tioning, including social relationships and employment.KEY TERMS\nArticular capsule —An envelope of tissue that sur-\nrounds a free moving joint, composed of an exter-nal layer of white fibrous tissue and an externalsynovial membrane that secretes a lubricant intothe joint.Description\nIn order to have a clear picture of these disorders,\ndissociation should first be understood. Dissociation is amechanism that allows the mind to separate or compart-mentalize certain memories or thoughts from normalconsciousness. These split-off mental contents are noterased. They may resurface spontaneously or be trig-gered by objects or events in the person’s environment.\nDissociation is a process that occurs along a spec-\ntrum of severity. It does not necessarily mean that a per-son has a dissociative disorder or other mental illness. Amild degree of dissociation occurs with some physicalstressors; people who have gone without sleep for a longperiod of time, have had “laughing gas” for dentalsurgery, or have been in a minor accident often havebrief dissociative experiences. Another commonplaceexample of dissociation is a person becoming involvedin a book or movie so completely that the surroundingsor the passage of time are not noticed. Another examplemight be driving on the highway and taking several exitswithout noticing or remembering. Dissociation is relatedto hypnosis in that hypnotic trance also involves a tem-porarily altered state of consciousness. Most patientswith dissociative disorders are highly hypnotizable.\nPeople in other cultures sometimes have dissociative\nexperiences in the course of religious (in certain trancestates) or other group activities. These occurrencesshould not be judged in terms of what is considered “nor-mal” in the United States.\nModerate or severe forms of dissociation are caused\nby such traumatic experiences as childhood abuse , com-\nbat, criminal attacks, brainwashing in hostage situations,or involvement in a natural or transportation disaster.Patients with acute stress disorder ,post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD), or conversion disorder and\nsomatization disorder may develop dissociative symp-toms. Recent studies of trauma indicate that the humanbrain stores traumatic memories in a different way thannormal memories. Traumatic memories are notprocessed or integrated into a person’s ongoing life inthe same fashion as normal memories. Instead they aredissociated, or “split off,” and may erupt into conscious-ness from time to time without warning. The affectedperson cannot control or “edit” these memories. Over aperiod of time, these two sets of memories, the normaland the traumatic, may coexist as parallel sets withoutbeing combined or blended. In extreme cases, differentsets of dissociated memories may alter subpersonalitiesof patients with dissociative identity disorder ( multiple\npersonality disorder ).\nThe dissociative disorders vary in their severity and\nthe suddenness of onset. It is difficult to give statistics\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1085Dissociative disordersfor their frequency in the United States because they are\na relatively new category and are often misdiagnosed.And, criterion for diagnosis require significant impair-ment in social or vocational functioning.\nDissociative amnesia\nDissociative amnesia is a disorder in which the\ndistinctive feature is the patient’s inability to remem-ber important personal information to a degree thatcannot be explained by normal forgetfulness. In manycases, it is a reaction to a traumatic accident or wit-nessing a violent crime. Patients with dissociativeamnesia may develop depersonalization or trancestates as part of the disorder, but they do not experi-ence a change in identity.\nDissociative fugue\nDissociative fugue is a disorder in which a person\ntemporarily loses his or her sense of personal identity andtravels to another location where he or she may assume anew identity. Again, this condition usually follows amajor stressor or trauma. Apart from inability to recalltheir past or personal information, patients with dissocia-tive fugue do not behave strangely or appear disturbed toothers. Cases of dissociative fugue are more common inwartime or in communities disrupted by a natural disaster.\nDepersonalization disorder\nDepersonalization disorder is a disturbance in\nwhich the patient’s primary symptom is a sense ofdetachment from the self. Depersonalization as a symp-tom (not as a disorder) is quite common in college-agepopulations. It is often associated with sleep deprivationor “recreational” drug use. It may be accompanied by“derealization” (where objects in an environment appearaltered). Patients sometimes describe depersonalizationas feeling like a robot or watching themselves from theoutside. Depersonalization disorder may also involvefeelings of numbness or loss of emotional “aliveness.”\nDissociative identity disorder (DID)\nDissociative identity disorder (DID) is the newer\nname for multiple personality disorder (MPD). DID isconsidered the most severe dissociative disorder andinvolves all of the major dissociative symptoms.\nDissociative disorder not otherwise specified\n(DDNOS)\nDDNOS is a diagnostic category ascribed to patients\nwith dissociative symptoms that do not meet the full cri-teria for a specific dissociative disorder.Causes and symptoms\nThe moderate to severe dissociation that occurs in\npatients with dissociative disorders is understood toresult from a set of causes:\n• an innate ability to dissociate easily\n• repeated episodes of severe physical or sexual abuse in\nchildhood\n• the lack of a supportive or comforting person to coun-\nteract abusive relative(s)\n• the influence of other relatives with dissociative symp-\ntoms or disorders\nThe relationship of dissociative disorders to child-\nhood abuse has led to intense controversy and lawsuitsconcerning the accuracy of childhood memories. Thebrain’s storage, retrieval, and interpretation of memoriesare still not fully understood. Controversy also existsregarding how much individuals presenting dissociativedisorders have been influenced by books and movies todescribe a certain set of symptoms (scripting).\nThe major dissociative symptoms are:\nAmnesia\nAmnesia in a dissociative disorder is marked by\ngaps in a patient’s memory for long periods of time or fortraumatic events. Doctors can distinguish this type ofamnesia from loss of memory caused by head injuries ordrug intoxication, because the amnesia is “spotty” andrelated to highly charged events and feelings.\nDepersonalization\nDepersonalization is a dissociative symptom in\nwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unreal, ischanging, or is dissolving. Some patients experiencedepersonalization as being outside their bodies or watch-ing a movie of themselves.\nDerealization\nDerealization is a dissociative symptom in which the\nexternal environment is perceived as unreal. The patientmay see walls, buildings, or other objects as changing inshape, size, or color. In some cases, the patient may feelthat other persons are machines or robots, though thepatient is able to acknowledge the unreality of this feeling.\nIdentity disturbances\nPatients with dissociative fugue, DDNOS, or DID\noften experience confusion about their identities oreven assume new identities. Identity disturbances resultfrom the patient having split off entire personality traits\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1086Dissociative disordersor characteristics as well as memories. When a stressful\nor traumatic experience triggers the reemergence ofthese dissociated parts, the patient may act differently,answer to a different name, or appear confused by his orher surroundings.\nDiagnosis\nWhen a doctor is evaluating a patient with dissocia-\ntive symptoms, he or she will first rule out physical con-ditions that sometimes produce amnesia, depersonaliza-tion, or derealization. These physical conditions includeepilepsy, head injuries, brain disease, side effects of med-ications, substance abuse, intoxication, AIDS, dementia\ncomplex, or recent periods of extreme physical stress\nand sleeplessness. In some cases, the doctor may give thepatient an electroencephalogram (EEG) to excludeepilepsy or other seizure disorders.\nIf the patient appears to be physically normal, the\ndoctor will rule out psychotic disturbances, includingschizophrenia . In addition, doctors can use some psy-\nchological tests to narrow the diagnosis. One is a screen-\ner, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). If thepatient has a high score on this test, he or she can be eval-uated further with the Dissociative Disorders InterviewSchedule (DDIS) or the Structured Clinical Interview forDSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). It is also pos-\nsible for doctors to measure a patient’s hypnotizability aspart of a diagnostic evaluation.\nTreatment\nTreatment of the dissociative disorders often com-\nbines several methods.\nPsychotherapy\nPatients with dissociative disorders often require\ntreatment by a therapist with some specialized under-standing of dissociation. This background is particularlyimportant if the patient’s symptoms include identityproblems. Many patients with dissociative disorders arehelped by group as well as individual treatment.\nMedications\nSome doctors will prescribe tranquilizers or antide-\npressants for the anxiety and/or depression that often\naccompany dissociative disorders. Patients with dissocia-tive disorders are, however, at risk for abusing or becom-ing dependent on medications. As of 2001, there is nodrug that can reliably counteract dissociation itself.\nHypnosis\nHypnosis is frequently recommended as a method of\ntreatment for dissociative disorders, partly because hyp-KEY TERMS\nAmnesia —A general medical term for loss of\nmemory that is not due to ordinary forgetfulness.Amnesia can be caused by head injuries, braindisease, or epilepsy, as well as by dissociation.\nDepersonalization —A dissociative symptom in\nwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unre-al, is changing, or is dissolving.\nDerealization —A dissociative symptom in which\nthe external environment is perceived as unreal.\nDissociation —A psychological mechanism that\nallows the mind to split off traumatic memories ordisturbing ideas from conscious awareness.\nFugue —A dissociative experience during which a\nperson travels away from home, has amnesia fortheir past, and may be confused about their identi-ty but otherwise appear normal.\nHypnosis —The means by which a state of extreme\nrelaxation and suggestibility is induced: used totreat amnesia and identity disturbances that occurin dissociative disorders.\nMultiple personality disorder (MPD) —An older\nterm for dissociative identity disorder (DID).\nTrauma —A disastrous or life-threatening event\nthat can cause severe emotional distress, includ-ing dissociative symptoms and disorders.\nnosis is related to the process of dissociation. Hypnosis\nmay help patients recover repressed ideas and memories.Therapists treating patients with DID sometimes usehypnosis in the process of “fusing” the patient’s alternatepersonalities.\nPrognosis\nPrognoses for dissociative disorders vary. Recovery\nfrom dissociative fugue is usually rapid. Dissociativeamnesia may resolve quickly, but can become a chronicdisorder in some patients. Depersonalization disorder,DDNOS, and DID are usually chronic conditions.

    "title": "Diuretics",
    "content": "Diuretics\nDefinition\nDiuretics are medicines that help reduce the amount\nof water in the body.\nPurpose\nDiuretics are used to treat the buildup of excess fluid\nin the body that occurs with some medical conditionssuch as congestive heart failure , liver disease, and kid-\nney disease. Some diuretics are also prescribed to treathigh blood pressure. These drugs act on the kidneys toincrease urine output. This reduces the amount of fluid inthe bloodstream, which in turn lowers blood pressure.\nDescription\nThere are several types of diuretics, also called water\npills:\n• Loop diuretics, such as bumetanide (Bumex) and\nfurosemide (Lasix), get their name from the loop-shaped part of the kidneys where they have their effect.\n• Thiazide diuretics include such commonly used diuret-\nics as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL, Esidrix),chlorothiazide (Diuril), and chlorthalidone (Hygroton).\n• Potassium-sparing diuretics prevent the loss of potassi-\num, which is a problem with other types of diuretics.Examples of potassium-sparing diuretics are amiloride(Midamor) and triamterene (Dyrenium).\nIn addition, some medicines contain combinations\nof two diuretics. The brands Dyazide and Maxzide, forexample, contain the thiazide diuretic hydrochloroth-iazide with the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene.\nSome nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines\ncontain diuretics. However, the medicines describedhere cannot be bought without a physician’s prescrip-tion. They are available in tablet, capsule, liquid, andinjectable forms.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\ndiuretic and may be different for different patients.Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or thepharmacist who filled the prescription for the correctdosage, and take the medicine exactly as directed.\nPrecautions\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking a diuretic\nis important. The physician will check to make sure themedicine is working as it should and will watch forunwanted side effects.\nSome people feel unusually tired when they first\nstart taking diuretics. This effect usually becomes lessnoticeable over time, as the body adjusts to the medicine.\nBecause diuretics increase urine output, people who\ntake this medicine may need to urinate more often, evenduring the night. Health care professionals can helppatients schedule their doses to avoid interfering withtheir sleep or regular activities.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1088DiureticsFor patients taking the kinds of diuretics that rob\npotassium from the body, physicians may recommendadding potassium-rich foods or drinks, such as citrus fruitsand juices, to the diet. Or they may suggest taking a potas-sium supplement or taking another medicine that keeps thebody from losing too much potassium. If the physicianrecommends any of these measures, be sure to closely fol-low his or her directions. Do not make other diet changeswithout checking with the physician. People who are tak-ing potassium-sparing diuretics should not add potassiumto their diets , as too much potassium may be harmful.\nPeople who take diuretics may lose too much water\nor potassium when they get sick, especially if they havesevere vomiting and diarrhea . They should check with\ntheir physicians if they become ill.\nThese medicines make some people feel lighthead-\ned, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lyingdown. Older people are especially likely to have thisproblem. Drinking alcohol, exercising, standing for longperiods, or being in hot weather may make the problemworse. To lessen the problem, get up gradually and holdonto something for support if possible. Avoid drinkingtoo much alcohol and be careful in hot weather or whenexercising or standing for a long time.\nAnyone who is taking a diuretic should be sure to\ntell the health care professional in charge before havingsurgical or dental procedures, medical tests or emergencytreatment.\nSome diuretics make the skin more sensitive to sun-\nlight. Even brief exposure to sun can cause a severe sun-\nburn ,itching , a rash, redness, or other changes in skin\ncolor. While being treated with this medicine, avoidbeing in direct sunlight, especially between 10 a.m. and 3p.m.; wear a hat and tightly woven clothing that coversthe arms and legs; use a sunscreen with a skin protectionfactor (SPF) of at least 15; protect the lips with a sunblock lipstick; and do not use tanning beds, tanningbooths, or sunlamps. People with fair skin may need touse a sunscreen with a higher skin protection factor.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or who\nare taking certain other medicines may have problems ifthey take diuretics. Before taking these drugs, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-\ntions to diuretics or sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) in the\npast should let his or her physician know before usinga diuretic. The physician should also be told about anyallergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-\nstances.PREGNANCY. Diuretics will not help the swelling of\nhands and feet that some women have duringpregnancy . In general, pregnant women should not use\ndiuretics unless a physician recommends their use.Although studies have not been done on pregnantwomen, studies of laboratory animals show that somediuretics can cause harmful effects when taken duringpregnancy.\nBREASTFEEDING. Some diuretics pass into breast\nmilk, but no reports exist of problems in nursing babieswhose mothers use this medicine. However, thiazidediuretics may decrease the flow of breast milk. Womenwho are breastfeeding and need to use a diuretic shouldcheck with their physicians.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Side effects of\nsome diuretics may be more likely in people who havehad a recent heart attack or who have liver disease or\nsevere kidney disease. Other diuretics may not workproperly in people with liver disease or severe kidneydisease. Diuretics may worsen certain medical condi-tions, such as gout ,kidney stones ,pancreatitis , lupus\nerythematosus, and hearing problems. In addition, peo-ple with diabetes should be aware that diuretics mayincrease blood sugar levels. People with heart or bloodvessel disease should know that some diuretics increasecholesterol or triglyceride levels. The risk of an allergicreaction to certain diuretics is greater in people withbronchial asthma . Before using diuretics, people with\nany of these medical problems should make sure theirphysicians are aware of their conditions. Also, peoplewho have trouble urinating or who have high potassiumlevels in their blood may not be able to take diuretics andshould check with a physician before using them.\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking diuretics with\ncertain other drugs may affect the way the drugs work ormay increase the chance of side effects.\nSide effects\nSome side effects, such as loss of appetite, nausea\nand vomiting , stomach cramps, diarrhea and dizziness ,\nusually lessen or go away as the body adjusts to the med-icine. These problems do not need medical attentionunless they continue or interfere with normal activities.\nPatients taking potassium-sparing diuretics should\nknow the signs of too much potassium and should checkwith a physician as soon as possible if any of these symp-toms occur:\n• irregular heartbeat\n• breathing problems\n• numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1089Diuretics• confusion or nervousness\n• unusual tiredness or weakness• weak or heavy feeling in the legs\nPatients taking diuretics that cause potassium loss\nshould know the signs of too little potassium and shouldcheck with a physician as soon as possible if they haveany of these symptoms:\n• fast or irregular heartbeat\n• weak pulse• nausea or vomiting\n• dry mouth\n• excessive thirst• muscle cramps or pain\n• unusual tiredness or weakness• mental or mood changes\nInteractions\nDiuretics may interact with other medicines. When\nthis happens, the effects of one or both of the drugs maychange or the risk of side effects may be greater. Anyonewho takes a diuretic should let the physician know allother medicines he or she is taking and should ask whetherthe possible interactions can interfere with drug therapy.Among the drugs that may interact with diuretics are:KEY TERMS\nInflammation —Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\nthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.\nLupus erythematosus —A chronic disease that\naffects the skin, joints, and certain internal organs.\nPancreas —A gland located beneath the stomach.\nThe pancreas produces juices that help breakdown food.\nPotassium —A mineral found in whole grains,\nmeat, legumes, and some fruits and vegetables.Potassium is important for many body processes,including proper functioning of the nerves andmuscles.\nTriglyceride —A substance formed in the body from\nfat in the diet. Triglycerides are the main fatty mate-rials in the blood. Together with protein, they makeup high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDLs andLDLs). Triglyceride levels are important in the diag-nosis and treatment of many diseases includinghigh blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease.• Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such\nas benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), andenalapril (Vasotec), used to treat high blood pressure.Taking these drugs with potassium-sparing diureticsmay cause levels of potassium in the blood to be toohigh, increasing the chance of side effects.\n• Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as cholestyramine\n(Questran) and colestipol (Colestid). Taking thesedrugs with combination diuretics such as Dyazide andMaxzide may keep the diuretic from working. Take thediuretic at least one hour before or four hours after thecholesterol-lowering drug.\n• Cyclosporine (Sandimmune), a medicine that suppress-\nes the immune system. Taking this medicine withpotassium-sparing diuretics may increase the chance ofside effects by causing levels of potassium in the bloodto be too high.\n• Potassium supplements, other medicines containing\npotassium, or salt substitutes that contain potassium.Taking these with potassium-sparing diuretics may leadto too much potassium in the blood, increasing thechance of side effects.\n• Lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depres-\nsive illness). Using this medicine with potassium-spar-ing diuretics may allow lithium to build up to poiso-nous levels in the body.\n• Digitalis heart drugs, such as digoxin (Lanoxin). Using\nthis medicine with combination diuretics such as tri-amterene-hydrocholorthiazide (Dyazide, Maxzide) maycause blood levels of the heart medicine to be too high,making side effects such as changes in heartbeat morelikely.\nThe list above does not include every drug that may\ninteract with diuretics. Check with a physician or phar-macist before combining diuretics with any other pre-scription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\nDiverticulitis seeDiverticulosis and\ndiverticulitis\nDiverticulosis and\ndiverticulitis\nDefinition\nDiverticulosis refers to a condition in which the\ninner, lining layer of the large intestine (colon) bulges\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1090Diverticulosis and diverticulitisout (herniates) through the outer, muscular layer. These\noutpouchings are called diverticula. Diverticulitis refersto the development of inflammation and infection in oneor more diverticula.\nDescription\nDiverticula tend to occur most frequently in the\nlast segment of the large intestine, the sigmoid colon.They occur with decreasing frequency as one examinesfurther back toward the beginning of the large intes-tine. The chance of developing diverticula increaseswith age, so that by the age of 50, about 20–50% of allpeople will have some diverticula. By the age of 90,virtually everyone will have developed some diverticu-la. Most diverticula measure about 3 mm to just over 3cm in diameter. Larger diverticula, termed giant diver-ticula, are quite infrequent, but may measure as largeas 15 cm in diameter.\nCauses and symptoms\nDiverticula are believed to be caused by overly\nforceful contractions of the muscular wall of the largeintestine. As areas of this wall spasm, they become weak-er and weaker, allowing the inner lining to bulge through.The anatomically weakest areas of the intestinal walloccur next to blood vessels which course through thewall, so diverticula commonly occur in this location.\nDiverticula are most common in the developed\ncountries of the West (North America, Great Britain,northern and western Europe). This is thought to be dueto the diet of these countries, which tends to be quite lowin fiber. A diet low in fiber results in the production ofsmaller volumes of stool. In order to move this smallerstool along the colon and out of the rectum, the colonmust narrow itself significantly, and does so by contract-ing down forcefully. This causes an increase in pressure,which, over time, weakens the muscular wall of the intes-tine and allows diverticular pockets to develop.\nThe origin of giant diverticula development is not\ncompletely understood, although one theory involves gasrepeatedly entering and becoming trapped in an already-existing diverticulum, causing stretching and expansionof that diverticulum.\nThe great majority of people with diverticulosis will\nremain symptom-free. Many diverticula are quite acci-dentally discovered during examinations for other condi-tions of the intestinal tract.\nSome people with diverticulosis have symptoms such\nas constipation , cramping, and bloating. It is unclear\nwhether these symptoms are actually caused by the diver-ticula themselves, or whether some other gastrointestinalcondition (such as irritable bowel syndrome ) might be\nresponsible. A complication of diverticulosis occursbecause many diverticula develop in areas very nearblood vessels. Therefore, one serious risk of diverticulosisinvolves bleeding. Although an infrequent complication,the bleeding can be quite severe. Seventy-five percent ofsuch bleeding episodes occur due to diverticula located onthe right side of the colon. About 50% of the time, suchbleeding will stop on its own.\nOne of the most common and potentially serious\ncomplications of diverticulosis is inflammation and infec-tion of a particular diverticulum, called diverticulitis.\nDiverticulitis is three times more likely to occur in\nthe left side of the large intestine. Since most diverticulaare located in the sigmoid colon (the final segment of thelarge intestine which empties into the rectum), mostdiverticulitis also takes place in the sigmoid. The elderlyhave the most serious complications from diverticulitis,although very severe infections can also occur in patients\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1091Diverticulosis and diverticulitis\nA barium study x ray showing colonic diverticulosis. (Cus-\ntom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)under the age of 50. Men are three times as likely as\nwomen to be stricken with diverticulitis.\nDiverticulitis is believed to occur when a hardened\npiece of stool, undigested food, and bacteria (called afecalith) becomes lodged in a diverticulum. This block-age interferes with the blood supply to the area, andinfection sets in.\nAn individual with diverticulitis will experience pain\n(especially in the lower left side of the abdomen) and fever .\nIn response to the infection and the irritation of nearby tis-sues within the abdomen, the abdominal muscles maybegin to spasm. About 25% of all patients with diverticuli-tis will have some rectal bleeding, although this rarelybecomes severe. Walled-off pockets of infection, calledabscesses, may appear within the wall of the intestine, oreven on the exterior surface of the intestine. When a diver-ticulum weakens sufficiently, and is filled to bulging withinfected pus, a perforation in the intestinal wall may devel-op. When the infected contents of the intestine spill out intothe abdomen, the severe infection called peritonitis may\noccur. Peritonitis is an infection and inflammation of thelining of the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum. Other com-plications of diverticulitis include the formation of abnor-mal connections between two organs that normally do notconnect (fistulas; for example, the intestine and the blad-der), and scarring outside of the intestine which squeezesoff a portion of the intestine, obstructing it.\nDiagnosis\nAs mentioned, the majority of diverticula do not\ncause any symptoms, and are often found by coincidenceduring an examination being performed for some othermedical condition.\nWhen diverticula are suspected because a patient\nbegins to have sudden rectal bleeding, the location of thebleeding can be studied by performing an angiography .\nAngiography involves inserting a tiny tube through anartery in the leg, and moving it up into one of the majorarteries of the gastrointestinal system. A particular chem-ical (contrast medium) which will show up on x-rayfilms is injected, and the area of bleeding is located bylooking for an area where the contrast is leaking into theinterior (lumen) of the intestine.\nA procedure called endoscopy provides another\nmethod for examining the colon and locating the site ofbleeding. In endoscopy, a small, flexible scope (endo-scope) is inserted through the rectum and into the intes-tine. The scope usually bears a fiber-optic camera, whichallows the view through this endoscope to be projectedonto a television screen. The operator can introduce theendoscope further and further through the intestine tofind the location of the bleeding.Diagnosis of diverticulitis is not difficult in\npatients with previously diagnosed diverticulosis. Thepresence of abdominal pain and fever in such an indi-vidual would make the suspicion of diverticulitis quitehigh. Examination of the abdomen will usually revealtenderness to touch, with the patient’s abdominal mus-cles contracting strongly to protect the tender area.During a rectal exam (performed by inserting a fingerinto the rectum), a doctor may be able to feel anabnormal mass. Touching this mass may prove painfulto the patient.\nWhen a practitioner is suspicious of diverticulitis as\nthe cause for the patient’s symptoms, he or she will mostlikely avoid the types of tests usually used to diagnosegastrointestinal disorders. These include barium enema\nand endoscopy. The concern is that the increased pres-sure exerted on the intestine during these exams mayincrease the likelihood of intestinal perforation. Aftermedical treatment for the diverticulitis, these examina-tions may be performed in order to learn the extent of thepatient’s disease.\nTreatment\nOnly about 20% of patients with diverticulosis ever\nhave symptoms which lead them to seek medical help.Most people never know that they have diverticula. Forthose individuals who have cramping pain and constipa-tion believed to be due to diverticulosis, the usual pre-scription involves increasing the fiber in the diet. Thiscan be done by adding special diet supplements of branor psyllium seed, which increase stool volume. Bleedingdiverticula can usually be treated by bed rest, with bloodtransfusion needed for more severe bleeding (hemor-\nrhaging). In cases of very heavy hemorrhaging, medica-tions which encourage clotting can be injected during thecourse of a diagnostic angiography.\nWhile there are almost no situations when uncom-\nplicated diverticulosis requires surgery, giant diverticulaalways require removal. This is due to the very highchance of infection and perforation of these diverticula.When giant diverticula are diagnosed, the usual treat-ment involves removing that portion of the intestine.\nTreatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis usually\nrequires hospitalization. “Resting the bowel” is a main-stay of treatment, and involves keeping the patient fromeating or sometimes even drinking anything by mouth.Therefore, the patient will need to receive fluids througha needle in the vein (intravenous or IV fluids). Antibi-\notics will also be administered through the IV . Some\nphysicians will agree to try treatment at home for verymildly ill patients. These patients will be put on a liquiddiet and receive oral antibiotics.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1092Diverticulosis and diverticulitisThe various complications of diverticulitis need to\nbe treated aggressively, because the death rate from such\nthings as perforation and peritonitis is quite high.Abscesses can be drained of their infected contents byinserting a needle through the skin of the abdomen andinto the abscess . When this is unsuccessful, open abdom-\ninal surgery will be required to remove the piece of theintestine containing the abscess. Fistulas require surgicalrepair, including the removal of the length of intestinecontaining the origin of the fistula, followed by immedi-ate reconnection of the two free ends of intestine. Peri-tonitis requires open surgery. The entire abdominal cavi-ty is cleaned by being irrigated (washed) with a warmedsterile saltwater solution, and the damaged piece ofintestine is removed. Obstructions require immediatesurgery to prevent perforation. Massive, uncontrollablebleeding, while rare, may require removal of part or allof the large intestine.\nDuring any of these types of operations, the surgeon\nmust make an important decision regarding the quantityof intestine which must be removed. When the amount ofintestine removed is great, it may be necessary to per-form a colostomy . A colostomy involves pulling the end\nof the remaining intestine through the abdominal wall, tothe outside. This bit of intestine is then fashioned so thata bag can be fit over it. The patient’s waste (feces) collectin the bag, because the intestine no longer connects withthe rectum. This colostomy may be temporary, in whichcase another operation will be required to reconnect theintestine, after some months of substantial healing hasoccurred. Other times, the colostomy will need to be per-manent, and the patient will have to adjust to living per-manently with the colostomy bag. Most people withcolostomies are able to go on with a very active life.\nOccasionally, a patient will have such severe diver-\nticular disease that a surgeon recommends planningahead, and schedules removal of a portion of the colon.This is done to avoid the high risk of surgery performedafter a complication has set in. Certain developments in apatient will identify those patients who are at very highrisk of experiencing dangerous complications. Such elec-tive surgery may be recommended:\n• when an older individual has had several attacks of\ndiverticulitis\n• when someone under the age of 50 has had even one\nattack\n• when treatment does not get rid of a painful mass• when the intestine appears to be narrowing on x-ray\nexamination (this could suggest the presence of cancer )\n• when certain patients begin to regularly experience\npainful urination or urinary infections (this suggestsKEY TERMS\nAngiography —An x-ray study of the arteries in a\nparticular part of the body.

    "title": "Dizziness",
    "content": "Dizziness\nDefinition\nAs a disorder, dizziness is classified into three cate-\ngories—vertigo, syncope, and nonsyncope nonvertigo.Each category has a characteristic set of symptoms, allrelated to the sense of balance. In general, syncope isdefined by a brief loss of consciousness ( fainting ) or by\ndimmed vision and feeling uncoordinated, confused, andlightheaded. Many people experience a sensation likesyncope when they stand up too fast. Vertigo is the feelingthat either the individual or the surroundings are spinning.This sensation is like being on a spinning amusementpark ride. Individuals with nonsyncope nonvertigo dizzi-ness feel as though they cannot keep their balance. Thisfeeling may become worse with movement.Description\nThe brain coordinates information from the eyes, the\ninner ear, and the body’s senses to maintain balance. Ifany of these information sources is disrupted, the brainmay not be able to compensate. For example, peoplesometimes experience motion sickness because the\ninformation from their body tells the brain that they aresitting still, but information from the eyes indicates thatthey are moving. The messages don’t correspond anddizziness results.\nVision and the body’s senses are the most important\nsystems for maintaining balance, but problems in theinner ear are the most frequent cause of dizziness. Theinner ear, also called the vestibular system, contains fluidthat helps fine tune the information the brain receivesfrom the eyes and the body. When fluid volume or pres-sure in one inner ear changes, information about balanceis altered. The discrepancy gives conflicting messages tothe brain about balance and induces dizziness.\nCertain medical conditions can cause dizziness,\nbecause they affect the systems that maintain balance.For example, the inner ear is very sensitive to changes inblood flow. Because medical conditions such as highblood pressure or low blood sugar can affect blood flow,these conditions are frequently accompanied by dizzi-ness. Circulation disorders are the most common causesof dizziness. Other causes are head injury , ear infection,\nallergies , and nervous system disorders.\nDizziness often disappears without treatment or with\ntreatment of the underlying problem, but it can be longterm or chronic. According to the National Institutes ofHealth, 42% of Americans will seek medical help fordizziness at some point in their lives. The costs mayexceed a billion dollars and account for five million doc-tor visits annually. Episodes of dizziness increase withage. Among people aged 75 or older, dizziness is themost frequent reason for seeing a doctor.\nCauses and symptoms\nCareful attention to symptoms can help determine\nthe underlying cause of the dizziness. Underlying prob-lems may be benign and easily treated or they may bedangerous and in need of intensive therapy. Not all casesof dizziness can be linked to a specific cause. More thanone type of dizziness can be experienced at the sametime and symptoms may be mixed. Episodes of dizzinessmay last for a few seconds or for days. The length of anepisode is related to the underlying cause.\nThe symptoms of syncope include dimmed vision,\nloss of coordination, confusion, lightheadedness, andsweating. These symptoms can lead to a brief loss of con-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1094Dizzinesssciousness or fainting. They are related to a reduced flow\nof blood to the brain; they often occur when a person isstanding up and can be relieved by sitting or lying down.Vertigo is characterized by a sensation of spinning or turn-ing, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears,headache , or fatigue . An individual may have trouble\nwalking, remaining coordinated, or keeping balance. Non-syncope nonvertigo dizziness is characterized by a feelingof being off balance that becomes worse if the individualtries moving or performing detail-intense tasks.\nA person may experience dizziness for many rea-\nsons. Syncope is associated with low blood pressure,heart problems, and disorders in the autonomic nervoussystem, the system of involuntary functions such asbreathing. Syncope may also arise from emotional dis-tress, pain , and other reactions to outside stressors. Non-\nsyncope nonvertigo dizziness may be caused by rapidbreathing, low blood sugar, or migraine headache ,a s\nwell as by more serious medical conditions.\nVertigo is often associated with inner ear problems\ncalled vestibular disorders. A particularly intense vestibulardisorder, Méniére’s disease, interferes with the volume offluid in the inner ear. This disease, which affects approxi-mately one in every 1,000 people, causes intermittent verti-go over the course of weeks, months, or years. Méniére’sdisease is often accompanied by ringing or buzzing in theear,hearing loss , and a feeling that the ear is blocked.\nDamage to the nerve that leads from the ear to the brain canalso cause vertigo. Such damage can result from headinjury or a tumor. An acoustic neuroma , for example, is a\nbenign tumor that wraps around the nerve. Vertigo can alsobe caused by disorders of the central nervous system andthe circulatory system, such as hardening of the arteries(arteriosclerosis), stroke , or multiple sclerosis .\nSome medications cause changes in blood pressure\nor blood flow. These medications can cause dizziness insome people. Prescription medications carry warningsof such side effects, but common drugs, such as caf-\nfeine or nicotine can also cause dizziness. Certain\nantibiotics can damage the inner ear and cause hearing\nloss and dizziness.\nDiet may cause dizziness. The role of diet may be\ndirect, as through alcohol intake. It may be also be indi-rect, as through arteriosclerosis caused by a high-fat diet.Some people experience a slight dip in blood sugar andmild dizziness if they miss a meal, but this condition israrely dangerous unless the person is diabetic. Food sen-sitivities or allergies can also be a cause of dizziness.Chronic conditions, such as heart disease, and seriousacute problems, such as seizures and strokes, can causedizziness. However, such conditions usually exhibit othercharacteristic symptoms.Diagnosis\nDuring the initial medical examination, an individ-\nual with dizziness should provide a detailed descriptionof the type of dizziness experienced, when it occurs, andhow often each episode lasts. A diary of symptoms mayhelp track this information. Report any symptoms thataccompany the dizziness, such as a ringing in the ear ornausea, any recent injury or infection, and any medica-tion taken.\nBlood pressure, pulse, respiration, and body temper-\nature are checked, and the ear, nose, and throat are scruti-nized. The sense of balance is assessed by moving theindividual’s head to various positions or by tilt-table test-ing. In tilt-table testing, the person lies on a table that canbe shifted into different positions and reports any dizzi-ness that occurs.\nFurther tests may be indicated by the initial exami-\nnation. Hearing tests help assess ear damage. x rays,computed tomography scan (CT scan), and magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) can pinpoint evidence of\nnerve damage, tumor, or other structural problems. If avestibular disorder is suspected, a technique calledelectronystagmography (ENG) may be used. ENG mea-sures the electrical impulses generated by eye move-ments. Blood tests can determine diabetes, high choles-\nterol , and other diseases. In some cases, a heart evalua-\ntion may be useful. Despite thorough testing, an underly-ing cause cannot always be determined.\nTreatment\nTreatment is determined by the underlying cause. If\nan individual has a cold or influenza , a few days of bed\nrest is usually adequate to resolve dizziness. Other caus-es of dizziness, such as mild vestibular system damage,may resolve without medical treatment.\nIf dizziness continues, drug therapy may prove\nhelpful. Because circulatory problems often cause dizzi-ness, medication may be prescribed to control bloodpressure or to treat arteriosclerosis. Sedatives may beuseful to relieve the tension that can trigger or aggravatedizziness. Low blood sugar associated with diabetessometimes causes dizziness and is treated by controllingblood sugar levels. An individual may be asked to avoidcaffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and any substances thatcause allergic reactions. A low-salt diet may also helpsome people.\nWhen other measures have failed, surgery may be\nsuggested to relieve pressure on the inner ear. If thedizziness is not treatable by drugs, surgery, or othermeans, physical therapy may be used and the patient maybe taught coping mechanisms for the problem.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1095DizzinessAlternative treatment\nBecause dizziness may arise from serious conditions,\nit is advisable to seek medical treatment. Alternative treat-ments can often be used alongside conventional medicinewithout conflict. Relaxation techniques, such as yoga and\nmassage therapy that focus on relieving tension, are pop-\nularly recommended methods for reducing stress . Aro-\nmatherapists recommend a warm bath scented with essen-tial oils of lavender, geranium, and sandalwood.\nHomeopathic therapies can work very effectively\nfor dizziness, and are especially applicable when noorganic cause can be identified. An osteopath or chiro-practor may suggest adjustments of the head, jaw, neck,and lower back to relieve pressure on the inner ear.Acupuncturists also offer some treatment options foracute and chronic cases of dizziness. Nutritionists maybe able to offer advice and guidance in choosing dietarysupplements, identifying foods to avoid, and balancingnutritional needs.KEY TERMS\nAcoustic neuroma —A benign tumor that grows on\nthe nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain.As the tumor grows, it exerts pressure on the innerear and causes severe vertigo.\nArteriosclerosis —Hardening of the arteries caused\nby high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure.\nAutonomic nervous system —The part of the ner-\nvous system that controls involuntary functionssuch as breathing and heart beat.\nComputed tomography (CT) —An imaging tech-\nnique in which cross-sectional x rays of the bodyare compiled to create a three-dimensional imageof the body’s internal structures.\nElectronystagmography —A method for measuring\nthe electricity generated by eye movements. Elec-trodes are placed on the skin around the eye andthe individual is subjected to a variety of stimuli sothat the quality of eye movements can be assessed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) —An imaging\ntechnique that uses a large circular magnet andradio waves to generate signals from atoms in thebody. These signals are used to construct images ofinternal structures.\nVestibular system —The area of the inner ear that\nhelps maintain balance.Prognosis\nOutcome depends on the cause of dizziness. Control-\nling or curing the underlying factors usually relieves dizzi-ness. In some cases, dizziness disappears without treat-ment. In a few cases, dizziness can become a permanentdisabling condition and a person’s options are limited.\nPrevention\nMost people learn through experience that certain\nactivities will make them dizzy and they learn to avoidthem. For example, if reading in a car produces motionsickness, an individual leaves reading materials for afterthe trip. Changes to the diet can also cut down onepisodes of dizziness in susceptible people. Relaxationtechniques can help ward off tension and anxiety that\ncan cause dizziness.\nThese techniques can help minimize or even prevent\ndizziness for people with chronic diseases. For example,persons with Méniére’s disease may avoid episodes ofvertigo by leaving salt, alcohol, and caffeine out of theirdiets . Reducing blood cholesterol can help diminish arte-\nriosclerosis and indirectly treat dizziness.\nSome cases of dizziness cannot be prevented.\nAcoustic neuromas, for example, are not predictable orpreventable. When the underlying cause of dizziness can-not be discovered, it may be difficult to recommend pre-ventive measures. Alternative approaches designed torebalance the body’s energy flow, such as acupuncture\nand constitutional homeopathy , may be helpful in cases\nwhere the cause of dizziness cannot be pinpointed.\nResources\nBOOKS\nYardley, Lucy.

Specifically, it is usefulin the work up of stroke patients, in assessing blood flow\nin the abdomen or legs, and in viewing the heart to moni-tor carotid artery diseases.\nPrecautions\nThe test is widely used because it is noninvasive,\nuses no x rays, and gives excellent images. It is harmless,painless, and widely available.\nDescription\nDoppler ultrasonography makes use of two different\nprinciples. The ultrasound principle is this: when a high-frequency sound is produced and aimed at a target, it willbe reflected by its target and the reflected sound can bedetected back at its origin. In addition, it is known thatcertain crystals (called piezoelectric crystals) produce anelectrical pulse when vibrated by a returning sound.\nThe Doppler principle is simply that sound pitch\nincreases as the source moves toward the listener anddecreases as it moves away.\nMedical science utilizes these two principles in the\nfollowing way. A transducer (sometimes called a probe)containing piezoelectric crystals sends a series of shortsound pulses into the body and pauses between eachpulse to listen for the returning sounds. The machinethen determines the direction and depth of each returningsound and coverts this into a point of light on a televisionmonitor. Thousands of these pulses are computed anddisplayed every second to produce an image of the organbeing studied. The image allows the doctor to see theorgan functioning in real time.\nThe newest addition to this test is the addition of\ncolor. Adding color to the image shows the direction andrate of blood flow more clearly.\nDuring a Doppler ultrasonography procedure the\ntechnician will apply a gel to the skin, then place thetransducer against the skin at various angles. The trans-ducer sends the information it receives to a televisionmonitor that shows a moving image of the organ beingstudied. The technician can save these images either onvideo tape, paper, or x-ray film for further study.\nPreparation\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\nThe ultrasound technician may apply a clear gel to the skinin order to help the transducer more freely over the body.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is necessary.\nNormal results\nA Doppler ultrasonography test showing no restrict-\ned blood flow, is a normal finding.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1097Doppler ultrasonography\nUltrasound doppler \ntransducer\nCarotid artery\nDoppler ultrasonography can detect the direction, velocity,\nand turbulence of blood flow.

    "title": "Down syndrome",
    "content": "Down syndrome\nDefinition\nDown syndrome is the most common cause of men-\ntal retardation and malformation in a newborn. It\noccurs because of the presence of an extra chromosome.\nDescription\nChromosomes are the units of genetic information\nthat exist within every cell of the body. Twenty-three dis-tinctive pairs, or 46 total chromosomes, are located with-in the nucleus (central structure) of each cell. When ababy is conceived by the combining of one sperm cellwith one egg cell, the baby receives 23 chromosomesfrom each parent, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Some-times, an accident in the production of a sperm or eggcell causes that cell to contain 24 chromosomes. ThisKEY TERMS\nDoppler effect —The principle that the sound of\nan object moving toward you has a higher pitchthan the sound when it’s moving away from you.\nTransducer —The part of a machine that changes\nsignals in one form into another form.\nUltrasound —Sound that is too high for the human\near to hear.event is referred to as nondisjunction. When this defec-\ntive cell is involved in the conception of a baby, that babywill have a total of 47 chromosomes. The extra chromo-some in Down syndrome is labeled number 21. For thisreason, the existence of three such chromosomes issometimes referred to as Trisomy 21.\nIn a very rare number of Down syndrome cases\n(about 1–2%), the original egg and sperm cells are com-pletely normal. The problem occurs sometime shortlyafter fertilization; during the phase where cells are divid-ing rapidly. One cell divides abnormally, creating a lineof cells with an extra chromosome 21. This form ofgenetic disorder is called a mosaic. The individual withthis type of Down syndrome has two types of cells: thosewith 46 chromosomes (the normal number), and thosewith 47 chromosomes (as occurs in Down syndrome).Some researchers have suggested that individuals withthis type of mosaic form of Down syndrome have lesssevere signs and symptoms of the disorder.\nAnother relatively rare genetic accident which can\ncause Down syndrome is called translocation. During celldivision, the number 21 chromosome somehow breaks. Apiece of the 21 chromosome then becomes attached toanother chromosome. Each cell still has 46 chromosomes,but the extra piece of chromosome 21 results in the signsand symptoms of Down syndrome. Translocations occurin about 3–4% of cases of Down syndrome.\nDown syndrome occurs in about one in every\n800–1,000 births. It affects an equal number of boys andgirls. Less than 25% of Down syndrome cases occur dueto an extra chromosome in the sperm cell. The majorityof cases of Down syndrome occur due to an extra chro-mosome 21 within the egg cell supplied by the mother(nondisjunction). As a woman’s age (maternal age)increases, the risk of having a Down syndrome babyincreases significantly. For example, at younger ages, therisk is about one in 4,000. By the time the woman is age35, the risk increases to one in 400; by age 40 the riskincreases to one in 110; and by age 45 the risk becomesone in 35. There is no increased risk of either mosaicismor translocation with increased maternal age.\nCauses and symptoms\nWhile Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder, a\nbaby is usually identified at birth through observation ofa set of common physical characteristics. Babies withDown syndrome tend to be overly quiet, less responsive,with weak, floppy muscles. Furthermore, a number ofphysical signs may be present. These include:\n• flat appearing face\n• small head\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1098Down syndrome• flat bridge of the nose\n• smaller than normal, low-set nose• small mouth, which causes the tongue to stick out and\nto appear overly large\n• upward slanting eyes\n• extra folds of skin located at the inside corner of each\neye, near the nose (called epicanthal folds)\n• rounded cheeks• small, misshapen ears\n• small, wide hands\n• an unusual, deep crease across the center of the palm\n(called a simian crease)\n• a malformed fifth finger• a wide space between the big and the second toes\n• unusual creases on the soles of the feet\n• overly-flexible joints (sometimes referred to as being\ndouble-jointed)\n• ahorter than normal height\nOther types of defects often accompany Down syn-\ndrome. About 30–50% of all children with Down syn-drome are found to have heart defects. A number of dif-ferent heart defects are common in Down syndrome,including abnormal openings (holes) in the walls thatseparate the heart’s chambers ( atrial septal defect ,ven-\ntricular septal defect ). These result in abnormal patterns\nof blood flow within the heart. The abnormal blood flowoften means that less oxygen is sent into circulationthroughout the body. Another heart defect that occurs inDown syndrome is called Tetralogy of Fallot . Tetralogy\nof Fallot consists of a hole in the heart, along with threeother major heart defects.\nMalformations of the gastrointestinal tract are pre-\nsent in about 5–7% of children with Down syndrome.The most common malformation is a narrowed, obstruct-ed duodenum (the part of the intestine into which thestomach empties). This disorder, called duodenal atresia,interferes with the baby’s milk or formula leaving thestomach and entering the intestine for digestion. Thebaby often vomits forcibly after feeding, and cannot gainweight appropriately until the defect is repaired.\nOther medical conditions that occur in patients with\nDown syndrome include an increased chance of develop-ing infections, especially ear infections and pneumonia ;\ncertain kidney disorders; thyroid disease (especially lowor hypothyroid); hearing loss ; vision impairment requir-\ning glasses (corrective lenses); and a 20-times greaterchance of developing leukemia (a blood disorder).\nDevelopment in a baby and child with Down syn-\ndrome occurs at a much slower than normal rate.Because of weak, floppy muscles (hypotonia), babies\nlearn to sit up, crawl, and walk much later than their nor-mal peers. Talking is also quite delayed. The level ofmental retardation is considered to be mild-to-moderatein Down syndrome. The actual IQ range of Down syn-drome children is quite varied, but the majority of suchchildren are in what is sometimes known as the trainablerange. This means that most people with Down syn-drome can be trained to do regular self-care tasks, func-tion in a socially appropriate manner in a normal homeenvironment, and even hold simple jobs.\nAs people with Down syndrome age, they face an\nincreased chance of developing the brain disease calledAlzheimer’s (sometimes referred to as dementia or\nsenility). Most people have a six in 100 risk of develop-ing Alzheimer’s, but people with Down syndrome have a25 in 100 chance of the disease. Alzheimer’s disease\ncauses the brain to shrink and to break down. The num-ber of brain cells decreases, and abnormal deposits andstructural arrangements occur. This process results in aloss of brain functioning. People with Alzheimer’s havestrikingly faulty memories. Over time, people withAlzheimer’s disease will lapse into an increasingly unre-sponsive state. Some researchers have shown that evenDown syndrome patients who do not appear to haveAlzheimer’s disease have the same changes occurring tothe structures and cells of their brains.\nAs people with Down syndrome age, they also have\nan increased chance of developing a number of other ill-nesses, including cataracts , thyroid problems, diabetes,\nand seizure disorders.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is usually suspected at birth, when the\ncharacteristic physical signs of Down syndrome arenoted. Once this suspicion has been raised, genetic test-\ning(chromosome analysis) can be undertaken in order to\nverify the presence of the disorder. This testing is usuallydone on a blood sample, although chromosome analysiscan also be done on other types of tissue, including skin.The cells to be studied are prepared in a laboratory.Chemical stain is added to make the characteristics of thecells and the chromosomes stand out. Chemicals areadded to prompt the cells to go through normal develop-ment, up to the point where the chromosomes are mostvisible, prior to cell division. At this point, they areexamined under a microscope and photographed. Thephotograph is used to sort the different sizes and shapesof chromosomes into pairs. In most cases of Down syn-drome, one extra chromosome 21 will be revealed. Thefinal result of such testing, with the photographed chro-mosomes paired and organized by shape and size, iscalled the individual’s karyotype.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1099Down syndromeTreatment\nNo treatment is available to cure Down syndrome.\nTreatment is directed at addressing the individual con-cerns of a particular patient. For example, heart defectswill many times require surgical repair, as will duodenalatresia. Many Down syndrome patients will need to wearglasses to correct vision. Patients with hearing impair-ment benefit from hearing aids .\nA new drug, referred to as a “smart drug,” has been\nreceiving some attention in the treatment of Down syn-drome patients. This drug, piracetam, has not beenproven to increase intellectual ability, despite testimoni-als that have been receiving attention on television andthe Internet. Piracetam has not been approved for use inthe United States, although it is being sold via the Inter-net. The National Down Syndrome Society and theNational Down Syndrome Congress do not recommendthe use of this drug as of 2001.\nWhile some decades ago, all Down syndrome chil-\ndren were quickly placed into institutions for lifelongcare. Research shows very clearly that the best outlookfor children with Down syndrome is a normal family lifein their own home. This requires careful support and edu-cation of the parents and the siblings. It is a life-changingevent to learn that a new baby has a permanent conditionthat will effect essentially all aspects of his or her devel-opment. Some community groups exist to help familiesdeal with the emotional effects of this new information,and to help plan for the baby’s future. Schools arerequired to provide services for children with Down syn-drome, sometimes in separate special education class-rooms, and sometimes in regular classrooms (this iscalled mainstreaming or inclusion).\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis in Down syndrome is quite variable,\ndepending on the types of complications (heart defects,susceptibility to infections, development of leukemia) ofeach individual baby. The severity of the retardation canalso vary significantly. Without the presence of heartdefects, about 90% of children with Down syndrome liveinto their teens. People with Down syndrome appear togo through the normal physical changes of aging more\nrapidly, however. The average age of death for an indi-\nvidual with Down syndrome is about 50–55 years.\nStill, the prognosis for a baby born with Down syn-\ndrome is better than ever before. Because of modernmedical treatments, including antibiotics to treat infec-\ntions and surgery to treat heart defects and duodenal atre-sia, life expectancy has greatly increased. Communityand family support allows people with Down syndrometo have rich, meaningful relationships. Because of educa-\ntional programs, some people with Down syndrome areable to hold jobs.\nMen with Down syndrome appear to be uniformly\nsterile (meaning that they are unable to have offspring).Women with Down syndrome, however, are fully capa-ble of having babies. About 50% of these babies, howev-er, will also be born with Down syndrome.\nPrevention\nEfforts at prevention of Down syndrome are aimed\nat genetic counseling of couples who are preparing to\nhave babies. A counselor needs to inform a woman thather risk of having a baby with Down syndrome increaseswith her increasing age. Two types of testing is availableduring a pregnancy to determine if the baby being car-\nried has Down syndrome.\nScreening tests are used to estimate the chance that\nan individual woman will have a baby with Down syn-drome. At 14–17 weeks of pregnancy, measurements of asubstance called AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) can be per-formed. AFP is normally found circulating in the bloodof a pregnant woman, but may be unusually high or lowwith certain disorders. Carrying a baby with Down syn-drome often causes AFP to be lower than normal. Thisinformation alone, or along with measurements of twoother hormones, is considered along with the mother’sage to calculate the risk of the baby being born withDown syndrome. These results are only predictions, andare only correct about 60% of the time.\nThe only way to definitively establish (with about\n98–99% accuracy) the presence or absence of Down syn-drome in a developing baby, is to test tissue from thepregnancy itself. This is usually done either by amnio-\ncentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In amnio-\ncentesis, a small amount of the fluid in which the baby isfloating is withdrawn with a long, thin needle. In chori-onic villus sampling, a tiny tube is inserted into the open-ing of the uterus to retrieve a small sample of the placen-ta (the organ that attaches the growing baby to the moth-er via the umbilical cord, and provides oxygen andnutrition ). Both amniocentesis and CVS allow the\nbaby’s own karyotype to be determined. A couple mustthen decide whether to use this information in order tobegin to prepare for the arrival of a baby with Down syn-drome, or to terminate the pregnancy.\nOnce a couple has had one baby with Down syn-\ndrome, they are often concerned about the likelihood offuture offspring also being born with the disorder. Mostresearch indicates that this chance remains the same asfor any woman at a similar age. However, when the baby\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1100Down syndromewith Down syndrome has the type that results from a\ntranslocation, it is possible that one of the two parents isa carrier of that defect. A carrier “carries” the geneticdefect, but does not actually have the disorder. Whenone parent is a carrier of a translocation, the chance offuture offspring having Down syndrome is greatlyincreased. The specific risk will have to be calculated bya genetic counselor.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarey, John C. “Chromosomal Disorders.” In Rudolph’s Pedi-\natrics, ed. Abraham M. Rudolph.

Interactions can lessen or magnify the desiredtherapeutic effect of a drug, or may cause unwanted orunexpected side effects. There are thousands of possibledrug-to-drug and drug-to-food interactions, and manymedications and supplements are contraindicated (notrecommended) under certain conditions or in patientswith specific diseases and disorders. This is why it isimperative that patients always keep their physician fullyinformed about all drugs and dietary supplements(including herbal remedies) they are taking.\nDescription\nThe primary site of drug metabolism is the liver, the\norgan that plays a major role in metabolism, digestion,detoxification, and elimination of substances from the\nbody. Enzymes in the liver are responsible for chemicallychanging drug components into substances known asmetabolites. Metabolites are then bound to other sub-stances for excretion through the lungs, or bodily fluidssuch as saliva, sweat, breast milk, and urine, or throughreabsorption by the intestines. The primary mode ofexcretion is through the kidneys.\nThe family of liver isoenzymes known as cytochrome\nP-450 are crucial to drug metabolism. These enzymes(labeled CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, andCYP3A4) have a catabolic action on substances, breakingthem down into metabolites. Consequently, they also act tolower the concentration of medication in the bloodstream.\nDrug interactions can occur when one drug inhibits\nor induces a P-450 that acts on another drug. An exam-ple is nicotine, a drug contained in tobacco, and knownto induce P-450s. Individuals with liver disease (e.g.,cirrhosis ) may also have insufficient levels of P-450\nenzymes. As a result, the concentration of drugs metab-olized by these enzymes (e.g., amprenavir and otherprotease inhibitors ) remains high and can build up to\ntoxic levels in the bloodstream. In addition, certainmedications and foods, such as grapefruit juice, caninactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of P-450s.Changing the drug dosage can alleviate the problem insome cases.\nThe metabolic rate can vary significantly from per-\nson to person, and drug dosages that work quickly andeffectively in one individual may not work well foranother. Factors such as genetics, environment, nutri-\ntion and age also influence drug metabolism; infants\nand elderly patients may have a reduced capacity tometabolize certain drugs, and may require adjustmentsin dosage.Causes and symptoms\nDrugs that commonly interact with other medica-\ntions include:\n•Diuretics . Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide can\nreduce serum potassium and sodium electrolyte levelswhen taken with digoxin and lithium, respectively.\n• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOI antide-\npressants can cause convulsions and other serious sideeffects when used with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g.,Imipramine, Nortriptyline), selective serotonin reup-\ntake inhibitors (SSRIs), or sympathomimetic drugs\n(e.g., amphetamines).\n•Antibiotics . Antibiotics may reduce the efficiency of\noral contraceptives.\n• Metals. Medications containing metals, such as\nantacids with aluminum additives and iron supple-\nments, can reduce the absorption of tetracyclines and\nfluoroquinolones.\n• Drugs that inhibit liver enzyme function. Drugs that\nslow drug metabolism include ciprofloxacin, ery-thromycin, fluoxetine, nefazodone, paroxetine, andritonavir. The therapeutic effect of other medicationstaken with these drugs may be amplified. Warfarin, ablood thinner, should be used with great caution in indi-viduals taking these drugs.\nFoods and beverages that may interact with drugs\ninclude:\n• Grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice inhibits the metabo-\nlism of many medications, including cyclosporine,felodipine, nifedipine, nitrendipine, nisoldipine, carba-mazepine, triazolam, and midazolam.\n• Foods and beverages with tyramines. Red wine, malted\nbeers, smoked foods (e.g., fish and meats), dried fruits,and aged cheeses may contain tyramines, and can causea severe and dangerous elevation in blood pressurewhen taken with MAOI inhibitors (a class of antide-pressants).\n• Dairy products. Milk, cream, and other dairy products\ncontaining calcium can prevention the absorption ofantibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, andciprofloxacin when they are taken with the drug. Inaddition, whole milk with vitamin D can cause milk-alkali syndrome in patients taking aluminum hydroxideantacids.\n• Caffeinated beverages. The caffeine contained in cof-\nfee and colas can influence drug metabolism.\n• Alcohol. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant,\nand should not be taken with other CNS depressants\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1102Drug metabolism/interactions(e.g., antipsychotics, antihistamines ). In addition, cer-\ntain fermented beverages may contain tyramines \nThis list is not all-inclusive and individuals should\nalways let their doctor and pharmacist know when theyare taking other medications, herbal remedies, or dietarysupplements. Anyone who experiences a serious reactionto a drug that is not consistent with its product labellingshould report the event to their doctor and/or the Med-Watch adverse event reporting system of the UnitedStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nAlternative treatment\nThe growing use of herbal supplements has also\nincreased the opportunity for adverse drug and herbalinteractions. In 2000, the FDA issued a warning on thepopular herb St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum ).\nThe supplement was found to inhibit the effect of indi-navir, a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV . Itmay also affect the action of cyclosporine and other pro-tease inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, ritonavir). Further clin-ical studies are still necessary to determine the full meta-bolic effects of the herb.\nOther herbs which may interact with allopathic med-\nications include gingko bilboa, ginseng, and garlic, whichmay all heighten the blood thinning effect of the anticoagu-lant warfarin.

A 2001 study by University ofFlorida researchers found that less than half of the womenparticipating disclosed their use of herbal therapies to theirhealthcare providers. In cases where a serious drug or herbinteraction occurs, withholding this information can delaydiagnosis and put the patient at increased risk.\nTreatment\nTreatment of a drug interaction is dependant on a\nnumber of factors, including the medication(s) or supple-ments used and the medical history of the patient.

    "title": "Drug overdose",
    "content": "Drug overdose\nDefinition\nA drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use\nof a drug or medicine in an amount that is higher than isnormally used.\nDescription\nAll drugs have the potential to be misused, whether\nlegally prescribed by a doctor, purchased over-the-counter at the local drug store, or bought illegally on thestreet. Taken in combination with other drugs or withalcohol, even drugs normally considered safe can causedeath or serious long term consequences. Children are\nparticularly at risk for accidental overdose, accountingfor over one million poisonings each year from drugs,alcohol, and other chemicals and toxic substances. Peo-ple who suffer from depression and who have suicidalthoughts are also at high risk for drug overdose.\nCauses and symptoms\nAccidental drug overdose may be the result of mis-\nuse of prescription medicines or commonly used medica-tions like pain relievers and cold remedies. Symptoms\ndiffer depending on the drug taken. Some of the drugscommonly involved in overdoses are listed below alongwith symptoms and outcomes.\nAcetaminophen is the generic name for the com-\nmonly used pain reliever Tylenol. Overdose of this drugcauses liver damage with symptoms that include loss ofappetite, tiredness, nausea and vomiting , paleness, and\nsweating. The next stage of symptoms indicates liverfailure and includes abdominal pain and tenderness,swelling of the liver, and abnormal blood tests for liverenzymes. In the last stage of this poisoning , liver failure\nadvances and the patient becomes jaundiced, with yel-lowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. They may alsoexperience kidney failure, bleeding disorders, andencephalopathy (swelling of the brain).\nAnticholinergic drugs (drugs that block the action of\nacetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) like atropine, scopo-lamine, belladonna, antihistamines , and antipsychotic\nagents cause the skin and moist tissues (like in the mouthand nose) to become dry and flushed. Dilated pupils, aninability to urinate, and mental disturbances are alsosymptoms. Severe toxicity can lead to seizures, abnormalheart rhythms, extremely high blood pressure, and coma .\nAntidepressant drugs like amitriptyline, desi-\npramine, and nortriptyline can cause irregular heart rate,vomiting, low blood pressure, confusion, and seizures. Anoverdose of antidepressants also causes symptoms similarto those seen with anticholinergic drug overdoses.\nCholinergic drugs (drugs that stimulate the\nparasympathetic nervous system) like carbamate andpilocarpine cause nausea, diarrhea , increased secretion\nof body fluids (sweat, tears, saliva, and urine), fatigue ,\nand muscle weakness. Convulsions are possible. Deathcan occur due to respiratory failure and heart failure .\nCocaine and crack cocaine overdoses cause seizures,\nhigh blood pressure, increased heart rate, paranoia , and\nother changes in behavior. Heart attack or stroke are\nserious risks within three days after cocaine overdose.\nDepressant drugs (tranquilizers, antianxiety drugs ,\nsleeping pills) cause sleepiness, slowed or slurred speech,difficulty walking or standing, blurred vision, impairedability to think, disorientation, and mood changes. Over-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1104Drug overdosedose symptoms can include slowed breathing, very low\nblood pressure, stupor, coma, shock , and death.\nDigoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause\nirregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite,and blurred vision.\nNarcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine,\nand codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) arealso in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causessedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart\nrate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where theblack centers of the eyes become smaller than normal,are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugsare taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun-teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that thepatient will stop breathing.\nSalicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or\nointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay),and creams for psoriasis , a skin condition. Initial symp-\ntoms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever , and vomiting,\npossibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose willcause metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis , con-\nditions where the body’s acid/base balance is malfunc-tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fastbreathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion,hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An\nincreased tendency to bleed is also common. Seriouscomplications include acute renal failure, coma, and heartfailure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the\nsymptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten-sive damage to the body before significant symptomsdevelop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be ableto tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. Thepatient’s recent medical and social history may also helpin a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that thepatient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumedrecently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hoursbefore the overdose, can be valuable in determining whatwas taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system.\nDifferent drugs have varying effects on the body’s\nacid/base balance and on certain elements in the bloodlike potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used todetect changes in body chemistry that may give clues towhat drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened forvarious drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug isidentified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fastthe drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests canalso be used to screen for some drugs and to detectchanges in the body’s chemistry. Blood and urine testsmay show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a\nresult of the overdose.\nTreatment\nImmediate care\nIf a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and\nthe person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is notbreathing, call for emergency help immediately. If theperson who took the drug is not having symptoms, don’twait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison controlcenter immediately. Providing as much information aspossible to the poison control center can help determinewhat the next course of action should be.\nThe poison control center, paramedics, and emer-\ngency room staff will want to know:\n• what drug(s) were taken—try to locate the drug’s con-\ntainer.\n• how much of the drug was taken\n• when was the drug taken\n• was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or\nchemicals\n• what is the age of the patient\n• what symptoms are the patient experiencing\n• is the patient conscious\n• is the patient breathing\nThe poison control center may recommend trying to\nget the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup,\nwhich is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar-macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom-mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house-holds with children. This medication should be used onlyon the advice of a medical professional. V omiting shouldnot be induced if the patient is unconscious.\nEmergency care\nEmergency medical treatment may include:\n• Assessment of the patient’s airway and breathing to\nmaking sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, isnot blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted throughthe mouth and into the trachea to help the patientbreath. This procedure is called intubation.\n• Assessment of the patient’s heart rate, blood pressure,\nbody temperature, and other physical signs that mightindicate the effects of the drug.\n• Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for\nthe presence of the suspected overdose drug, and anyother drugs or alcohol that might be present.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1105Drug overdose• Elimination of the drug that has not yet been absorbed is\nattempted. V omiting may be induced using ipecac syrupor other drugs that cause vomiting. Ipecac syrup shouldnot be given to patients who overdosed with tricyclicantidepressants, theophylline, or any drug that causes asignificant change in mental status. If a patient vomitswhile unconscious, there is a serious risk of choking .\n• Gastric lavage, or washing out the stomach, may be\nattempted. For this procedure a tube flexible tube isinserted through the nose, down the throat, and into thestomach. The contents of the stomach are then suc-tioned out through the tube. A solution of saline (saltwater) is injected into the tube to rinse out the stomach.This solution is then suctioned out. This is the processused when someone has his/her stomach pumped.\n• Activated charcoal is sometimes given to absorb the\ndrug.\n• Medication to stimulate urination or defecation may be\ngiven to try to flush the excess drug out of the bodyfaster.\n• Intravenous (IV) fluids may be given. An intravenous\nline, a needle inserted into a vein, may be put into thearm or back of the hand. Fluids, either sterile saline(salt water solution) or dextrose (sugar water solution),can be administered through this line. Increasing fluidscan help to flush the drug out of the system and toreestablish balance of fluids and minerals in the body.\nThe pH (acid/base balance) of the body may need to becorrected by administering electrolytes like sodium,potassium, and bicarbonate through this IV line. Ifdrugs need to be administered quickly, they can also beinjected directly into the IV line.\n• Hemodialysis is a procedure where blood is circulated\nout of the body, pumped through a dialysis machine,then reintroduced back into the body.

An\nantidote is another drug that counteracts or blocks theoverdose drug. For example, acetaminophen overdosecan be treated with an oral medication, N-acetylcys-teine (Mucomyst), if the level of acetaminophen foundin the blood is extremely high. Naloxone is an anti-nar-cotic drug that is given to counteract narcotic poison-ing. Nalmefen or methadone may also be used.\n• Psychiatric evaluation may be recommended if the drug\noverdose was taken deliberately.\nPrognosis\nWhile many victims of drug overdose recover with-\nout long term effects, there can be serious consequences.Some drug overdoses cause the failure of major organslike the kidneys or liver, or failure of whole systems likethe respiratory or circulatory systems. Patients who sur-vive drug overdose may need kidney dialysis , kidney or\nliver transplant, or ongoing care as a result of heart fail-ure, stroke, or coma. Death can occur in almost any drugoverdose situation, particularly if treatment is not startedimmediately.\nPrevention\nTo protect children from accidental drug overdose,\nall medications should be stored in containers with childresistant caps. All drugs should be out of sight and out ofreach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Pre-scription medications should be used according to direc-tions and only by the person whose name is on the label.Threats of suicide need to be taken seriously and appro-priate help sought for people with depression or othermental illness that may lead to suicide.\nResources\nBOOKS\nClinical Manual of Poisoning and Drug Overdose.

    "title": "Drug therapy monitoring",
    "content": "Drug therapy monitoring\nDefinition\nDrug therapy monitoring, also known as Therapeutic\nDrug Monitoring (TDM), is a means of monitoring druglevels in the blood.\nPurpose\nTDM is employed to measure blood drug levels so\nthat the most effective dosage can be determined, withtoxicity prevented. TDM is also utilized to identify non-compliant patients (those patients who, for whatever rea-son, either cannot or will not comply with drug dosagesas prescribed by the physician).\nPrecautions\nBecause so many different factors influence blood\ndrug levels, the following points should be taken intoconsideration during TDM: the age and weight of thepatient; the route of administration of the drug; the drug’sabsorption rate, excretion rate, delivery rate, and dosage;other medications the patient is taking; other diseases thepatient has; the patient’s compliance regarding the drugtreatment regimen; and the laboratory methods used totest for the drug.\nDescription\nTDM is a practical tool that can help the physician\nprovide effective and safe drug therapy in patients whoneed medication. Monitoring can be used to confirm ablood drug concentration level that is above or below thetherapeutic range, or if the desired therapeutic effect ofthe drug is not as expected. If this is the case, anddosages beyond normal then have to be prescribed, TDMcan minimize the time that elapses.TDM is important for patients who have other dis-\neases that can affect drug levels, or who take other medi-cines that may affect drug levels by interacting with thedrug being tested. As an example, without drug monitor-ing, the physician cannot be sure if a patient’s lack ofresponse to an antibiotic reflects bacterial resistance, oris the result of failure to reach the proper therapeuticrange of antibiotic concentration in the blood. In cases oflife-threatening infections, timing of effective antibiotictherapy is critical to success. It is equally crucial to avoidtoxicity in a seriously ill patient. Therefore, if toxicsymptoms appear with standard dosages, TDM can beused to determine changes in dosing.\nDrawn blood, used for TDM, demonstrates a drug\naction in the body at any specific time, whereas drug lev-els examined from urine samples reflect the presence of adrug over many days (depending on the rate of excre-tion). Therefore, blood testing is the procedure of choicewhen definite data are required. However, for adequateabsorption and therapeutic levels to be accurate, it isimportant to allow for sufficient time to pass between theadministration of the medication and the collection of theblood sample.\nBlood specimens for drug monitoring can be taken\nat two different times: during the drug’s highest thera-peutic concentration (“peak” level), or its lowest(“trough” level). Occasionally called residual levels,trough levels show sufficient therapeutic levels; whereaspeak levels show poisoning (toxicity). Peak and trough\nlevels should fall within the therapeutic range.\nPreparation\nIn preparing for this test, the following guidelines\nshould be observed:\n• Depending on the drug to be tested, the physician\nshould decide if the patient is to be fasting (nothing\nto eat or drink for a specified period of hours) beforethe test.\n• For patients suspected of symptoms of drug toxicity,\nthe best time to draw the blood specimen is when thesymptoms are occurring.\n• If there is a question as to whether an adequate dose of\nthe drug is being achieved, it is best to obtain trough(lowest therapeutic concentration) levels.\n• Peak (highest concentration) levels are usually obtained\none to two hours after oral intake, approximately onehour after intramuscular (IM) administration (a shot inthe muscle), and approximately 30 minutes after intra-venous (IV) administration. Residual, or trough, levelsare usually obtained within 15 minutes of the nextscheduled dose.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1107Drug therapy monitoringRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after blood is drawn, or accumulationof blood under the puncture site (hematoma).\nResources\nBOOKS\nLane, Keryn A.

Decreased salivation can make swal-lowing difficult, can decrease taste sensation, and canpromote tooth decay .\nCauses and symptoms\nDry mouth, resulting from thickened or reduced\nsalvia flow, can be caused by a number of factors: med-ications, both prescription and over-the-counter; sys-temic diseases, such as anemia or diabetes, manifesta-tions of Sjögren’s syndrome (as rheumatoid arthritis ,\nlupus, chronic hardening and thickening of the skin, orchronic and progressive inflammation of sketal muscles);infections of the salivary glands; blockage of the salivaryducts caused by stones or tumors forming in the ductsthrough which the saliva passes; dehydration ; medical\ntherapies, such as local surgery or radiation; secretionreduction normally involved in the aging proces; and\nemotional stress .\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of dry mouth is not difficult. The\npatient will state that his or her saliva is very thick ornon-existent. Finding the cause of the dry mouth may bemore difficult and require some laboratory testing. Sali-vary gland biopsy for stones or tumors should be per-formed if indicated.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of dry mouth involves the manage-\nment of the condition causing it. If dry mouth is causedby medication, the medication should be changed. If drymouth is caused by blockage of the salivary ducts, thecause of the blockage should be investigated. When sys-temic diseases, such as diabetes and anemia, are broughtunder control dry mouth problems may decrease.\nThe use of caffeine-containing beverages, alcoholic\nbeverages, and mouthwashes containing alcohol shouldbe minimized. The drinking of water and fruit juices willdecrease dry mouth problems. Chewing gum and lemondrops can be used to stimulate saliva flow. Bitters alsocan initiate salivary flow as long as the salivary glandsand ducts are functional.

Duodenal obstruction\nDefinition\nDuodenal obstruction is a failure of food to pass out of\nthe stomach either from a complete or partial obstruction.\nDescription\nThe duodenum is the first part of the intestine, into\nwhich the stomach, the gall bladder, and the pancreasempty their contents. The pylorus connects the duode-num with the stomach and contains the valve that regu-lates stomach emptying. Obstruction usually occurs rightat this outlet, so that the gall bladder and pancreas areunable to drain their secretions without hindrance.\nCauses and symptoms\nObstruction of the duodenum occurs in adults and\ninfants, each for a different set of reasons. In adults, theusual cause is a peptic ulcer of such antiquity that repeat-ed cycles of injury and scarring have narrowed the pas-sageway. Medical treatment of ulcers has progressed tothe point where such obstinate ulcer disease is rarelyseen any more. In infants, the conditions are congeni-tal—either the channel is underdeveloped or the pylorusis overdeveloped. The first type is called duodenalhypoplasia and the second is termed hypertrophicpyloric stenosis . In rare cases, the channel may be miss-\ning altogether, a condition called duodenal atresia. To saythat these anomalies are congenital is not to say theircause is understood. As with most birth defects , the spe-\ncific cause is not known.\nFood that cannot exit the stomach in the forward\ndirection will return whence it came. V omiting is theconstant symptom of duodenal obstruction. It may bepreceded by indigestion and nausea as the stomach\nattempts to squeeze its contents through an ever narrow-ing outlet.\nHypertrophic pyloric stenosis appears soon after\nbirth. The infant will vomit feedings, lose weight, and berestless and irritable.\nDiagnosis\nX rays taken with contrast material in the stomach\nreadily demonstrate the site of the blockage and often theulcer that caused it. Gastroscopy is another way to evalu-ate the problem. In infants, x rays may not be necessary todetect pyloric stenosis. It is often possible to feel theenlarged pylorus, like an olive, deep under the ribs and seethe stomach rippling as it labors to force food through.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1110Duodenal obstructionTreatment\nBowel obstruction requires a surgeon, sometimes\nimmediately. Newer surgical techniques constantlyimprove the outcome, but obstruction is a mechanicalproblem that needs a mechanical solution. Most adultswho come to surgery for obstruction have suffered foryears from peptic ulcer disease. They will usually benefitfrom ulcer surgery at the same time their obstruction is\nrelieved. The surgeon will therefore select a procedurethat combines relief of obstruction with remedy for ulcerdisease. There are many choices. In fact, even withoutobstruction, functional considerations require ulcersurgery to include enhancement of stomach emptying.\nTo treat an infant with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,\nsome surgeons have had success with forceful balloondilation of the pylorus done through a gastroscope, butthe standard procedure is to cut across the overdevelopedcircular muscle that is constricting the stomach outlet.There are reports of infant hypertrophic pyloric stenosisremitting without surgery following a very careful feed-ing schedule, but mortality is unacceptably high.\nPrognosis\nA functioning and unrestricted intestine is a prereq-\nuisite for living independent of the most advanced andcontinuous medical care available. Achieving this desir-able goal is the rule with surgery for duodenal obstruc-tions of all types. The bowel is so malleable that there isa rearrangement to suit every occasion. The variety ofpossible configurations is limited only by the surgeon’simagination.\nPrevention\nPrompt and effective treatment of peptic ulcers will\nprevent chronic scarring and narrowing. Drugs devel-oped over the past few decades have all but eliminatedthe need for ulcer surgery.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBarker, L. Randol, ed., et al. Principles of Ambulatory Medi-\ncine.

About half the casesoccur in women over 45 years of age, and about one fifthoccur in women under age 20.\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is diagnosed when\nother causes of uterine bleeding have been eliminated.Failure of the ovary to release an egg during the menstru-al cycle occurs in about 70% of women with DUB. Thisis probably related to a hormonal imbalance.\nDUB is common in women who have polycystic\novary syndrome (cysts on the ovaries). Women who are\non dialysis may also have heavy or prolonged periods. Sodo some women who use an intrauterine device ( IUD )\nfor birth control.\nDUB is similar to several other types of uterine bleed-\ning disorders and sometimes overlaps these conditions.\nMenorrhagia\nMenorrhagia, sometimes called hypermenorrhea, is\nanother term for abnormally long, heavy periods. Thistype of period can be a symptom of DUB, or many otherdiseases or disorders. In menorrhagia, menstrual periodsoccur regularly, but last more than seven days, and bloodloss exceeds 3 oz (88.7 ml). Passing blood clots is com-mon. Between 15–20% of healthy women experiencedebilitating menorrhagia that interferes with their normalactivities. Menorrhagia may or may not signify a seriousunderlying problem.\nMetrorrhagia\nMetrorrhagia is bleeding between menstrual periods.\nBleeding is heavy and irregular as opposed to ovulatoryspotting which is light bleeding, in mid-cycle, at the timeof ovulation.\nPolymenorrhea\nPolymenorrhea describes the condition of having\ntoo frequent periods. Periods occur more often thanevery 21 days, and ovulation usually does not occur dur-ing the cycle.\nCauses and symptoms\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding often occurs when\nthe endometrium, or lining of the uterus, is stimulated togrow by the hormone estrogen. When exposure to estro-gen is extended, or not balanced by the presence of prog-esterone, the endometrium continues to grow until it out-grows its blood supply. Then it sloughs off, causingirregular bleeding. If the bleeding is heavy enough and\nfrequent enough, anemia can result.\nMenorrhagia is representative of DUB. It is caused\nby many conditions including some outside the repro-ductive system. Causes of menorrhagia include:\n• adenomyosis (a benign condition characterized by\ngrowths in the area of the uterus)\n• imbalance between the hormones estrogen and proges-\nterone\n• fibroid tumors\n• pelvic infection•endometrial cancer (cancer of the inner mucous\nmembrane of the uterus)\n• endometrial polyps•endometriosis (a condition in which endometrial or\nendrometrial-like tissue appears outside of its normalplace in the uterus)\n• use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception\n• hypothyroidism• blood clotting problems (rare)\n• lupus erythematosus\n• pelvic inflammatory disease• steroid therapy• advanced liver disease• renal (kidney) disease• chemotherapy (cancer treatment with chemicals)\nTo diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding, many of\nthe potential causes mentioned above must be eliminat-ed. When all potential causes connected with pregnancy,infection, and tumors (benign or malignant) are eliminat-ed, then menorrhagia is presumed to be caused by dys-functional uterine bleeding.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of any menstrual irregularity begins with\nthe patient herself. The doctor will ask for a detaileddescription of the problem, and take a history of howlong it has existed, and any patterns the patient hasobserved. A woman can assist the doctor in diagnosingthe cause of abnormal uterine bleeding by keeping arecord of the time, frequency, length, and quantity ofbleeding. She should also tell the doctor about any ill-nesses, including long-standing conditions, like diabetes\nmellitus . The doctor will also inquire about sexual activ-\nity, use of contraceptives, current medications, and pastsurgical procedures.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1112Dysfunctional uterine bleedingLaboratory tests\nAfter taking the woman’s history, the gynecologist\nor family practitioner does a pelvic examination and Papsmear. To rule out specific causes of abnormal bleeding,the doctor may also do a pregnancy test and blood teststo check the level of thyroid hormone. Based on the ini-tial test results, the doctor may want to do tests to deter-mine the level of other hormones that play a role inreproduction. A test of blood clotting time and an adrenalfunction test are also commonly done.\nImaging\nImaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval-\nuating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina-tion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to helplocate uterine fibroids , also called uterine leiomyoma, a\ntype of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy—where a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly intothe uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining—isalso used to assess the condition of the uterus.\nHystersalpingography can help outline endometrial\npolyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer.In this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast mediahas been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to\nlocate fibroids and tumors.\nInvasive procedures\nEndometrial biopsy (the removal and examination\nof endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce-dure. It allows the doctor to sample small areas of the uter-ine lining, while cervical biopsy allows the cervix to besampled. Tissues are then examined for any abnormalities.\nDilation and curettage (D & C), once common is\nrarely done today for diagnosis of DUB. It is done whilethe patient is under either general or regional anesthesia.Women over 30 are more likely to need a D & C, as partof the diagnostic procedure, than younger women.\nBecause DUB is diagnosed by eliminating other\npossible disorders, diagnosis can take a long time andinvolve many tests and procedures. Older women arelikely to need more extensive tests than adolescentsbecause the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greaterin this age group, and therefore must be definitivelyeliminated before treating bleeding symptoms.\nTreatment\nTreatment of DUB depends on the cause of the\nbleeding and the age of the patient. When the underlyingcause of the disorder is known, that disorder is treated.KEY TERMS\nDilation and curettage (D & C) —A procedure\nperformed under anesthesia during which thecervix is dilated, and tissue lining the uterus isscraped out with a metal spoon-shaped instrumentor a suction tube. The procedure can be eitherdiagnostic, or to remove polyps.\nEndometrial biopsy —The removal of tissue either\nby suction or scraping of samples of tissue fromthe uterus. The cervix is not dilated. The procedurehas a lower rate of diagnostic accuracy than a D &C, but can be done as an office procedure underlocal anesthesia.\nEndometrial cancer —Cancer of the inner mucous\nmembrane of the uterus.\nFibroids, or fibroid tumors —Fibroid tumors are\nnon-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus.They occur in 30–40% of women over age 40,and do not need to be removed unless they arecausing symptoms that interfere with a woman’snormal activities.\nHypothyroidism —A disorder in which the thyroid\ngland produces too little thyroid hormone causinga decrease in the rate of metabolism with associat-ed effects on the reproductive system.\nLupus erythematosus —A chronic inflammatory\ndisease in which inappropriate immune systemreactions cause abnormalities in the blood vesselsand connective tissue.\nProgesterone —A hormone naturally secreted by\nthe ovary, or manufactured synthetically, thatprepares the uterus for implantation of a fertil-ized egg.\nProstaglandins —A group of chemicals that medi-\nate, or determine the actions of other chemicals inthe cell or body.\nOtherwise the goal of treatment is to relieve the symp-\ntoms to a degree that uterine bleeding does not interferewith a woman’s normal activities or cause anemia.\nGenerally the first approach to controlling DUB is to\nuse oral contraceptives that provide a balance between\nthe hormones estrogen and progesterone. Oral contracep-tives are often very effective in adolescents and youngwomen in their twenties. NSAIDs ( nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs ), like Naprosyn and Motrin, are\nalso used to treat DUB.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1113Dysfunctional uterine bleedingWhen bleeding cannot be controlled by hormone\ntreatment, surgery may be necessary. Dilation and curet-tage sometimes relieves the symptoms of DUB. If thatfails, endometrial ablation removes the uterine lining, butpreserves a woman’s uterus. This procedure is sometimesbe used instead of hysterectomy . However, as it affects\nthe uterus, it can only be used when a woman has com-pleted her childbearing years. The prescription of iron isalso important to decrease the risk of enemia.\nUntil the 1980s, hysterectomy often was used to\ntreat heavy uterine bleeding. Today hysterectomy is usedless frequently to treat DUB, and then only after othermethods of controlling the symptoms have failed. A hys-terectomy leaves a woman unable to bear children, and,therefore, is limited largely to women who are unable to,or uninterested in, bearing children. Still, hysterectomyis a common treatment for long-standing DUB in womendone with childbearing.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative practitioners concentrate on good nutri-\ntion as a way to prevent heavy periods that are not caused\nby uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, endometriosis, orcancer. Iron supplementation (100 mg per day) not onlyhelps prevent anemia, but also appears to reduce menor-rhagia in many women. Other recommended dietary sup-plements include vitamins A and C. Vitamin C improves\ncapillary fragility and enhances iron uptake.\nVitamin E and bioflavonoid supplements are also\nrecommended. Vitamin E can help reduce blood flow,and bioflavonoids help strengthen the capillaries. Vita-min K is known to play a role in clotting and is helpful insituations where heavy bleeding may be due to clottingabnormalities\nBotanical medicines used to assist in treating abnor-\nmal bleeding include spotted cranesbill ( Geranium macu-\nlatum ), birthroot ( Trillium pendulum ), blue cohosh\n(Caulophyllum thalictroides ), witch hazel ( Hamamelis\nvirginiana ), shepherd’s purse ( Capsella bursa-pastoris ),\nand yarrow ( Achillea millifolia ). These are all stiptic\nherbs that act to tighten blood vessels and tissue. Hor-monal balance can also be addressed with herbal formula-tions containing phytoestrogens and phytoprogesterone.\nPrognosis\nResponse to treatment for DUB is highly individual\nand is not easy to predict. The outcome depends largelyon the woman’s medical condition and her age. Manywomen, especially adolescents, are successfully treatedwith hormones (usually oral contraceptives). As a lastresort, hysterectomy removes the source of the problemby removing the uterus, but this operation is not without\nrisk, or the possibility of complications.\nPrevention\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is not a preventable\ndisorder.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDeCherney, Alan H., and Martin L.

    "title": "Dyslexia",
    "content": "Dyslexia\nDefinition\nDyslexia is a learning disability characterized by\nproblems in reading, spelling, writing, speaking, or lis-tening. In many cases, dyslexia appears to be inherited.\nDescription\nThe word dyslexia is derived from the Greek word,\ndys(meaning poor or inadequate) and the word lexis\n(meaning words or language).\nThe National Institutes of Health estimates that\nabout 15% of the United States population is affectedby learning disabilities, mostly with problems in lan-guage and reading. The condition appears in all ages,races, and income levels. Dyslexia is not a disease, butdescribes rather a different kind of mind that learns in adifferent way from other people. Many people with thecondition are gifted and very productive; dyslexia is notat all linked to low intelligence. In fact, intelligence hasnothing to do with dyslexia.\nDyslexic children seem to have trouble learning\nearly reading skills, problems hearing individual soundsin words, analyzing whole words in parts, and blendingsounds into words. Letters such as “d” and “b” may beconfused.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1114DyslexiaWhen a person is dyslexic, there is often an unexpect-\ned difference between achievement and aptitude. However,each person with dyslexia has different strengths and weak-nesses, although many have unusual talents in art, athletics,architecture, graphics, drama, music, or engineering. Thesespecial talents are often in areas that require the ability tointegrate sight, spatial skills, and coordination.\nOften, a person with dyslexia has a problem translat-\ning language into thought (such as in listening or read-ing), or translating thought into language (such as inwriting or speaking).\nCommon characteristics include problems with:\n• identifying single words\n• understanding sounds in words, sound order, or rhymes• spelling\n• transposing letters in words\n• handwriting\n• reading comprehension\n• delayed spoken language\n• confusion with directions, or right/left handedness• confusion with opposites (up/down, early/late, and so on)\n• mathematics\nCauses and symptoms\nThe underlying cause of dyslexia is not known,\nalthough research suggests the condition is often inherit-ed. In 1999, The Centre for Reading Research in Norwaypresented the first research to study the largest familywith reading problems ever known. By studying the read-ing and writing abilities of close to 80 family membersacross four generations the researchers reported, for thefirst time, that chromosome 2 can be involved in theinheritability of dyslexia. When a fault occurs on thisgene it leads to difficulties in processing written lan-guage. Previous studies have pointed out linkages of otherpotential dyslexia genes to chromosome 1, chromosome15 (DYX1 gene), and to chromosome 6 (DYX2 gene).The researchers who pinpointed the newly localized geneon chromosome 2 (DYX3) hope that this finding will leadto earlier and more precise diagnoses of dyslexia.\nNew research suggests a possible link with a subtle\nvisual problem that affects the speed with which affected\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1115Dyslexia\nA student with dyslexia has difficulty copying words. (Photograph by Will & Deni McIntyre, Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced\nby permission.)people can read. Other experts believe that dyslexia is\nrelated to differences in the structure and function of thebrain that manifests differently in different people.\nDiagnosis\nAnyone who is suspected to have dyslexia should\nhave a comprehensive evaluation, including hearing,vision, and intelligence testing. The test should includeall areas of learning and learning processes, not justreading.\nAs further research pinpoints the genes responsible\nfor some cases of dyslexia, there is a possibility that ear-lier testing will be established to allow for timely inter-ventions to prevent the onset of the condition and to treatit when it does occur.\nUnfortunately, in many schools, a child is not identi-\nfied as having dyslexia until after repeated failures.\nTreatment\nIf a child is diagnosed with dyslexia, the parents\nshould find out from the school or the diagnosticianexactly what the problem is, and what method of teach-ing is recommended and why. No single method willwork with every child, and experts often disagree as tothe best method to use.\nThe primary focus of treatment is aimed at helping\nthe specific learning problem of each affected person.Most often, this may include modifying teaching meth-ods and the educational environment, since traditionaleducational methods will not always work with a dyslex-ic child.\nPeople with dyslexia need a structured language pro-\ngram, with direct instruction in the letter-sound system.Teachers must give the rules governing written language.Most experts agree that the teacher should emphasize theassociation between simple phonetic units with letters orletter groups, rather than an approach that stresses mem-orizing whole words.\nIt is important to teach these students using all the\nsenses: hearing, touching, writing, and speaking, provid-ed by an instructor who is specifically trained in a pro-gram that is effective for dyslexic students.KEY TERMS\nSpatial skills —The ability to locate objects in three\ndimensional world using sight or touch.Prognosis\nMany successful and even famous people have\ndyslexia. How well a person with dyslexia functions inlife depends on the way the disability affects that person.There is a great deal of variation among different peoplewith dyslexia, producing different symptoms and differ-ent degrees of severity.\nPrognosis is usually good if the condition is diag-\nnosed early, and if the person has a strong self imagewith supportive family, friends, and teachers. It is imper-ative for a good outcome that the person be involved in agood remedial program.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDavis, Ronald D., and Eldon M. Braun.

    "title": "Dysmenorrhea",
    "content": "Dysmenorrhea\nDefinition\nDysmenorrhea is the occurrance of painful cramps\nduring menstruation.\nDescription\nMore than half of all girls and women suffer from\ndysmenorrhea (cramps), a dull or throbbing pain that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1116Dysmenorrheausually centers in the lower mid-abdomen, radiating\ntoward the lower back or thighs. Menstruating women ofany age can experience cramps.\nWhile the pain may be only mild for some women,\nothers experience severe discomfort that can significant-ly interfere with everyday activities for several days eachmonth.\nCauses and symptoms\nDysmenorrhea is called “primary” when there is no\nspecific abnormality, and “secondary” when the pain iscaused by an underlying gynecological problem. It isbelieved that primary dysmenorrhea occurs when hor-mone-like substances called “prostaglandins” producedby uterine tissue trigger strong muscle contractions in theuterus during menstruation. However, the level ofprostaglandins doesn’t seem to have anything to do withhow strong a woman’s cramps are. Some women havehigh levels of prostaglandins and no cramps, whereasother women with low levels have severe cramps. This iswhy experts assume that cramps must also be related toother things (such as genetics, stress , and different body\ntypes) in addition to prostaglandins. The first year or two ofa girl’s periods are not usually very painful. However, onceovulation begins, the blood levels of the prostaglandinsrise, leading to stronger contractions.\nSecondary dysmenorrhea may be caused by endo-\nmetriosis , fibroid tumors, or an infection in the pelvis.\nThe likelihood that a woman will have cramps\nincreases if she:\n• has a family history of painful periods\n• leads a stressful life• doesn’t get enough exercise\n• uses caffeine\n• has pelvic inflammatory disease\nSymptoms include a dull, throbbing cramping in the\nlower abdomen that may radiate to the lower back andthighs. In addition, some women may experience nausea\nand vomiting ,diarrhea , irritability, sweating, or dizzi-\nness. Cramps usually last for two or three days at the\nbeginning of each menstrual period. Many women oftennotice their painful periods disappear after they havetheir first child, probably due to the stretching of theopening of the uterus or because the birth improves theuterine blood supply and muscle activity.\nDiagnosis\nA doctor should perform a thorough pelvic exam\nand take a patient history to rule out an underlying condi-tion that could cause cramps.KEY TERMS\nEndometriosis —The growth of uterine tissue out-\nside the uterus.\nHormone —A chemical messenger secreted by a\ngland and released into the blood, which allows itto travel to distant cells where it exerts an effect.\nOvary —One of the two almond-shaped glands in\nthe female body that produces the hormonesestrogen and progesterone.\nOvulation —The monthly release of an egg from\nan ovary.\nProgesterone —The hormone produced by the\novary after ovulation that prepares the uterine lin-ing for a fertilized egg.\nUterus —The female reproductive organ that con-\ntains and nourishes a fetus from implantation untilbirth.\nTreatment\nSecondary dysmenorrhea is controlled by treating\nthe underlying disorder.\nSeveral drugs can lessen or completely eliminate\nthe pain of primary dysmenorrhea. The most popularchoice are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAIDs), which prevent or decrease the formation ofprostaglandins. These include aspirin , ibuprofen\n(Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). For more severe pain,prescription strength ibuprofen (Motrin) is available.These drugs are usually begun at the first sign of theperiod and taken for a day or two. There are many dif-ferent types of NSAIDs, and women may find that oneworks better for them than the others.\nIf an NSAID is not available, acetaminophen\n(Tylenol) may also help ease the pain. Heat applied to thepainful area may bring relief, and a warm bath twice aday also may help. While birth control pills will ease thepain of dysmenorrhea because they lead to lower hor-mone levels, they are not usually prescribed just for pain\nmanagement unless the woman also wants to use them\nas a birth control method. This is because these pills maycarry other more significant side effects and risks.\nNew studies of a drug patch containing glyceryl\ntrinitrate to treat dysmenorrhea suggest that it also mayhelp ease pain. This drug has been used in the past toease preterm contractions in pregnant women.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1117DysmenorrheaAlternative treatment\nSimply changing the position of the body can help\nease cramps. The simplest technique is assuming thefetal position, with knees pulled up to the chest whilehugging a heating pad or pillow to the abdomen. Like-wise, several yoga positions are popular ways to ease\nmenstrual pain. In the “cat stretch,” position, the womanrests on her hands and knees, slowly arching the back.The pelvic tilt is another popular yoga position, in whichthe woman lies with knees bent, and then lifts the pelvisand buttocks.\nDietary recommendations to ease cramps include\nincreasing fiber, calcium, and complex carbohydrates,cutting fat, red meat, dairy products, caffeine, salt, andsugar. Smoking also has been found to worsen cramps.\nRecent research suggests that vitamin B supplements,primarily vitamin B\n6in a complex, magnesium, and fish\noil supplements (omega-3 fatty acids) also may helprelieve cramps.\nOther women find relief through visualization, con-\ncentrating on the pain as a particular color and gainingcontrol of the sensations. Aromatherapy and massage\nmay ease pain for some women. Others find that imagin-ing a white light hovering over the painful area can actu-ally lessen the pain for brief periods.\nExercise may be a way to reduce the pain of men-\nstrual cramps through the brain’s production of endor-phins, the body’s own painkillers. And orgasm can makea woman feel more comfortable by releasing tension inthe pelvic muscles.\nAcupuncture and Chinese herbs are another popu-\nlar alternative treatments for cramps.\nPrognosis\nMedication should lessen or eliminate pain.\nPrevention\nNSAIDs taken a day before the period begins should\neliminate cramps for some women.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie Eisenstat, and Terra Ziporyn.

    "content": "Dyspepsia\nDefinition\nDyspepsia can be defined as painful, difficult, or dis-\nturbed digestion, which may be accompanied by symp-toms such as nausea and vomiting ,heartburn , bloat-\ning, and stomach discomfort.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe digestive problems may have an identifiable\ncause, such as bacterial or viral infection, peptic ulcer,gallbladder, or liver disease. The bacteria Helicobacter\npylori is often found in those individuals suffering from\nduodenal or gastric ulcers. Investigation of recurrentindigestion should rule out these possible causes.\nOften, there is no organic cause for the problem, in\nwhich case dyspepsia is classified as functional or nonul-cer dyspepsia. There is evidence that functional dyspepsiamay be related to abnormal motility of the upper gastroin-testinal tract (a state known as dysmotility in which theesophagus, stomach, and upper intestine behave abnor-mally). These patients may respond to a group of drugscalled prokinate agents. A review of eating habits (e.g.chewing with the mouth open, gulping food, or talkingwhile chewing) may reveal a tendency to swallow air. Thismay contribute to feeling bloated, or to excessive belching.Smoking ,caffeine , alcohol, or carbonated beverages may\ncontribute to the discomfort. When there is sensitivity orallergy to certain food substances, eating those foods maycause gastrointestinal distress. Some medications are asso-ciated with indigestion. Stomach problems may also be aresponse to stress or emotional unrest.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1118DyspepsiaDiagnosis\nA physical examination by a health care profes-\nsional may reveal mid-abdominal pain . A rectal exami-\nnation may be done to rule out bleeding. If blood is\nfound on rectal exam, laboratory studies, including ablood count may be ordered. Endoscopy and barium\nstudies may be used to rule out underlying gastrointesti-nal disease. Upper gastrointestinal x-ray studies usingbarium may allow for visualization of abnormalities.Endoscopy permits collection of tissue and culture speci-mens which may be used to further confirm a diagnosis.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of dyspepsia is based on assessment\nof symptoms and suspected causative factors. Clinicalevaluation is aimed at distinguishing those patients whorequire immediate diagnostic work-ups from those whocan safely benefit from more conservative initial treat-ment. Some of the latter may require only reassurance,dietary modifications, or antacid use. Medications toblock production of stomach acids, prokinate agents, orantibiotic treatment may be considered.

    "title": "Ear exam with an otoscope",
    "content": "Ear exam with an otoscope\nDefinition\nAn otoscope is a hand-held instrument with a tiny\nlight and a cone-shaped attachment called an ear specu-lum, which is used to examine the ear canal. An earexamination is a normal part of most physical examina-tions by a doctor or nurse. It is also done when an earinfection or other type of ear problem is suspected.\nPurpose\nAn otoscope is used to look into the ear canal to see\nthe ear drum. Redness or fluid in the eardrum can indi-cate an ear infection. Some otoscopes can deliver a smallpuff of air to the eardrum to see if the eardrum willvibrate (which is normal). This type of ear examinationwith an otoscope can also detect a build up of wax in theear canal, or a rupture or puncture of the eardrum.\nPrecautions\nNo special precautions are required. However, if an\near infection is present, an ear examination may causesome discomfort or pain .\nDescription\nAn ear examination with an otoscope is usually done\nby a doctor or a nurse as part of a complete physicalexamination . The ears may also be examined if an ear\ninfection is suspected due to fever , ear pain, or hearing\nloss. The patient will often be asked to tip the head\nslightly toward the shoulder so the ear to be examined ispointing up. The doctor or nurse may hold the ear lobe asthe speculum is inserted into the ear, and may adjust theposition of the otoscope to get a better view of the earcanal and eardrum. Both ears are usually examined, evenif there seems to be a problem with just one ear.\nPreparation\nNo special preparation is required prior to an ear\nexamination with an otoscope. The ear speculum, whichis inserted into the ear, is cleaned and sanitized before itis used. The speculums come in various sizes, and thedoctor or nurse will select the size that will be most com-fortable for the patient’s ear.\nAftercare\nIf an ear infection is diagnosed, the patient may\nrequire treatment with antibiotics . If there is a buildup of\nwax in the ear canal, it might be rinsed or scraped out.\nRisks\nThis type of ear examination is simple and generally\nharmless. Caution should always be used any time anobject is inserted into the ear. This process could irritatean infected external ear canal and could rupture aneardrum if performed improperly or if the patient moves.\nNormal results\nThe ear canal is normally skin-colored and is cov-\nered with tiny hairs. It is normal for the ear canal to havesome yellowish-brown earwax. The eardrum is typicallythin, shiny, and pearly-white to light gray in color. Thetiny bones in the middle ear can be seen pushing on theE\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1121GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1121eardrum membrane like tent poles. The light from the\notoscope will reflect off of the surface of the ear drum.\nAbnormal results\nAn ear infection will cause the eardrum to look red\nand swollen.

Tym-panoplasty (any surgical procedure on the eardrum ormiddle ear) should not be performed on patients withchronic sinus or nasal problems or in some patients withmedical problems such as poorly controlled diabetes andheart disease. Surgery for congenital microtia and atresia(abscense of normal bodily openings, such as the outerear canal) should not be performed if the middle earspace is totally or almost totally absent.\nDescription\nMost ear surgery is microsurgery, performed with an\noperating microscope to enable the surgeon to view thevery small structures of the ear. The use of minimallyinvasive laser surgery for middle ear procedures is\ngrowing. Laser surgery reduces the amount of traumadue to vibration, enhances coagulation, and enables sur-geons to access hard to reach places in the middle ear.Laser surgery can be performed in an office operatingsuite. Types of ear surgery include stapedectomy, tym-panoplasty, myringotomy and ear tube surgery, earsurgery to repair a perforated eardrum ,cochlear\nimplants , and tumor removal .\nStapedectomy\nTo restore hearing loss, which is usually due to oto-\nsclerosis , stapedectomy is performed. Stapedectomy is\nthe removal of all or part of the stapes, one of the bones inthe middle ear, and replacement with a tiny prosthesis. Anincision is made in the middle ear, the small bones areidentified, and the stapes is removed. The stainless steelwire and cellulose sponge prosthesis is inserted, blood\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1122Ear surgeryGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1122and fluid are drained, and the wound is closed. Performed\nin a hospital or outpatient surgical facility under local orgeneral anesthetic, full recovery takes about three weeksbut hearing should improve immediately.\nTympanoplasty\nTympanoplasty is performed to reconstruct the\neardrum after partial or total conductive hearing loss,usually caused by chronic middle ear infections, or per-forations that do not heal. This is usually a same daysurgery, performed under either local or general anesthe-sia. After making an incision in the ear to view the perfo-ration, the ear drum is elevated away from the ear canaland lifted forward. If the bones of hearing (ossicularchain) are functioning, tissue is taken from the ear andgrafted to the eardrum to close the perforation. A thinsheet of silastic and Gelfoam hold the graft in place. Theear is stitched together, and a sterile patch is placed onthe outside of the ear canal. Tympanoplasty is successfulin over 90% of all cases. The need for ossicular recon-struction (reconstruction of tiny bones of the middle ear)is sometimes known before surgery and and even whenidentified during surgery, can usually be done whilereconstructing the eardrum. If the gap between the anvilbone and the stapes is small, a small piece of bone or car-tilage from the patient can be inserted; if is is large, theincus bone is removed, modelled into a prosthesis, andreinserted between the stapes and the malleus. Recon-struction could also be achieved by inserting a strut madefrom artificial bone. For tympanoplasty with ossicularreconstruction, the patient usually stays in the hospitalovernight. The recovery period is about four weeks.\nMyringotomy and ear tube surgery\nMyringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed to\ndrain ear fluid and prevent ear infections when antibi-\notics don’t work or when ear infections are chronic. The\nprocess normalizes pressure in the middle ear anddecreases fluid accumulation. It is most commonly per-formed on infants and children, in whom ear infectionsare most frequent, and may be done on one or both ears.The surgeon makes a small hole in the ear drum, thenuses suction to remove fluid. A small ear tube of metal orplastic is inserted into the ear drum to allow continualdrainage. The tube prevents infections as long as it staysin place, which varies from six months to three years.When the tube falls out, the hole grows over. As many of25% of children under the age of two who need ear tubesmay need them again. Myringotomy and ear tube surgeryis performed in a hospital, using a general anesthetic formost children and a local anesthetic for older children oradults. No anesthetic may be used for infants. The proce-dure usually takes about two hours. Most patients can gohome the same day; children under three years of age and\nthose with chronic diseases usually stay overnight.\nEar surgery for a perforated eardrum\nEar surgery for a perforated eardrum is only per-\nformed in rare cases where it does not heal on its own. Inmost cases, this is performed in a surgeon’s office using atopical anesthetic. The surgeon scratches the undersur-face of the eardrum, stimulating the skin to heal and theeardrum to close. A thin patch placed on the eardrum’souter surface allows the skin under the eardrum to heal.\nCochlear implants\nCochlear implants stimulate nerve ends within the\ninner ear, enabling deaf children to hear. The device has amicrophone that remains outside the ear, a processor thatselects and codes speech sounds, and a receiver/stimulatorto convert the coded sounds to electric signals that stimulatethe hearing nerve and are recognized by the brain as sound.During surgery, an incision is made behind and slightlyabove the ear. A circular hole is drilled in the bone to receivethe device’s internal coil. The mastoid bone leading to themiddle ear is opened to receive the electrodes. The internalcoil is inserted and secured, followed by the electrodes. Thewound is stitched up and when it heals, an external unitcomprised of a stimulator with a microphone is wornbehind the ear. Performed in a hospital under general anes-thesia, the operation takes about two hours and usuallyrequires a hospital stay overnight. The patient can resumenormal activities in two to three weeks.\nEar surgery for tumors\nSome ear tumors can be very serious and should be\nremoved surgically. For a tumor on the skin of the earcanal, the skin is removed surgically, the bone beneath it\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1123Ear surgery\nMicrosurgery being performed in the inner ear.

Reproduced bypermission.)GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1123is drilled away, and a skin graft is placed in the ear canal.\nIf the tumor is near the eardrum, the skin of the ear canaland the eardrum are removed along with the bone sur-rounding the ear canal. A skin graft is placed on the barebone. For basal cell cancers and low grade glandularmalignancies, surgical resection of the ear canal is ade-quate. Squamous cell carcinoma, a serious form of can-\ncer, of the external ear canal requires radical surgery, fol-\nlowed by radiation therapy . Cholesteatoma, a benign\ntumor caused by an infection in a perforated eardrum thatdid not heal properly and can destroy the bones of hear-ing, is removed with microsurgery. Mastoidectomy is\nperformed for mastoiditis , an inflammation of the mid-\ndle ear, if medical therapy does not work. Petrous apicec-tomy is performed to drain the petrous apicitis, the bonebetween the middle ear and the clivis.\nEar surgery for congenital ear defects\nCongenital atresia, the absence of the external ear\ncanal, and congenital microtia, abnormal growth of theexternal ear, often occur together, although atresia canoccur without microtia. Surgery to reconstruct the earusually takes place when the child is four or five years oldand may require several operations. A facial plastic sur-geon and an ear surgeon work together, repairing themicrotia first and then the atresia. During surgery, a bonyopening is created over the bones of hearing. The surfacesof the bony ear canal are then relined with a skin graftfrom the thigh or abdomen. Tissue from behind theeardrum is used to create a new eardrum. In many cases,the middle ear will also need to be reconstructed. Surgeryis performed in a hospital under general anesthesia.\nOther types of ear surgery\nSurgery may also be appropriate to remove multiple\nbony overgrowths of the ear canal or in rare cases ofcompromised auditory tube function, to narrow the tube.KEY TERMS\nAuditory —Relating to the sense of the organs of\nhearing.\nCholesteatoma —A cystic mass of cells in the mid-\ndle ear, occurring as a congential defect or as aserious complication of a disease or traumtic con-dition of the ear.\nOtologic —Relating to the study, diagnosis, and\ntreatment of diseases of the ear and related struc-tures.Preparation\nThe preparation depends upon the type of ear\nsurgery performed.

    "title": "Echinacea",
    "content": "Echinacea\nDefinition\nEchinacea, or purple coneflower, is a perennial herb\nof the Composite family, commonly known as the daisyfamily. Most often referred to as the purple coneflower,this hardy plant also known as Sampson root, Missourisnakeroot, and rudbeckia. The prominent, bristly seedhead inspired the generic name of the plant, taken fromthe Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog.\nDescription\nEchinacea is a North American prairie native, abun-\ndant in the Midwest, and cultivated widely in ornamentaland medicinal gardens. The purple-pink rays of the blos-som droop downward from a brassy hued center conecomposed of many small, tubular florets. The conspicu-ous flowers bloom singly on stout, prickly stems frommid-summer to autumn. Flower heads may grow to 4 in(10.16 cm) across. The dark green leaves are opposite,entire, lanceolate, toothed, and hairy with three promi-nent veins. The narrow upper leaves are attached to thestem with stalks. The lower leaves are longer, emergingfrom the stem without a leaf stalk, and growing to 8 in(20.32 cm) in length. The plant develops deep, slender,black roots. Echinacea propagates easily from seed or byroot cuttings. However, due to its increasing popularityas an herbal supplement, echinacea is numbered amongthe 19 medicinal plants considered at risk by the Vermontnonprofit organization, United Plant Savers.\nPurpose\nThree species of echinacea are useful medicinally:\nEchinacea augustifolia, Echinacea purpurea , and Echi-nacea pallida . The entire plant has numerous medicinal\nproperties that act synergistically to good effect. Echi-nacea is most often used to boost the immune system andfight infection. Research has shown that echinaceaincreases production of interferon in the body. It is anti-septic and antimicrobial, with properties that act toincrease the number of white blood cells available todestroy bacteria and slow the spread of infection. As adepurative, the herbal extract cleanses and purifies thebloodstream, and has been used effectively to treat boils .\nEchinacea is vulnerary, promoting wound healing throughthe action of a chemical substance in the root known ascaffeic acid glycoside. As an alterative and an immuno-modulator, echinacea acts gradually to promote beneficialchange in the entire system. It has also been used to treaturinary infection and Candida albicans infections. Echi-\nnacea is a febrifuge, useful in reducing fevers. It is alsouseful in the treatment of hemorrhoids . A tincture, or a\nstrong decoction of echinacea serves as an effectivemouthwash for the treatment of pyorrhea and gingivitis.\nNative American plains Indians relied on echinacea\nas an all-purpose antiseptic. The Sioux tribe valued theroot as a remedy for snake bite, the Cheyenne tribechewed the root to quench thirst, and another tribewashed their hands in a decoction of echinacea toincrease their tolerance of heat. European settlers learnedof the North American herb’s many uses, and soonnumerous echinacea-based remedies were commerciallyavailable from pharmaceutical companies in the UnitedStates. Echinacea was a popular remedy in the UnitedStates through the 1930s. It was among many medicinalherbs listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia , the official Unit-\ned States government listing of pharmaceutical rawmaterials and recipes. The herb fell out of popular use inthe United States with the availability of antibiotics . In\nWest Germany, over 200 preparations are made from thespecies E. purpurea . Commercially prepared salves, tinc-\ntures, teas, and extracts are marketed using standardizedextracts. Echinacea is regaining its status in the UnitedStates as a household medicine-chest staple in manyhomes. It is one of the best-selling herbal supplements inUnited States health food stores.\nClinical studies have found that the entire plant pos-\nsesses medicinal properties with varying levels of effec-tiveness. Echinacea is of particular benefit in the treatmentof upper respiratory tract infections. Some research hasshown that echinacea activates the macrophages thatdestroy cancer cells and pathogens. When taken after can-\ncer treatments, an extract of the root has been found toincrease the body’s production of white blood cells. Echi-nacea has been shown to be most effective when taken atthe first sign of illness, rather than when used as a dailypreventative. Other research has demonstrated the signifi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1125EchinaceaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1125cant effect of E. purpurea root on reducing the duration\nand severity of colds and flu. Some herbal references listonly the root as the medicinal part, others include the aeri-al parts of the plant, particularly the leaf. But researchstudies in Europe and the United States have concludedthat the entire plant is medicinally effective. Most researchhas been done on the species E. pallida and E. purpurea .\nAll three species of echinacea are rich in vitamins and\nminerals . Echinacea is an herbal source of niacin, chromi-\num, iron, manganese, selenium, silicon, and zinc.\nPreparations\nThe quality of any herbal supplement depends great-\nly on the conditions of weather and soil where the herbwas grown, the timing and care in harvesting, and themanner of preparation and storage.\nDecoction is the best method to extract the mineral\nsalts and other healing components from the coarser herbmaterials, such as the root, bark, and stems. It is preparedby adding 1 oz (28.4 g) of the dried plant materials, or 2oz (56.7 g) of fresh plant parts, to 1 pt (0.47 l) of pure,unchlorinated, boiled water in a non-metallic pot. Sim-mer for about one half hour. Strain and cover. A decoc-tion may be refrigerated for up to two days and retain itshealing qualities.\nAn infusion is the method used to derive benefits\nfrom the leaves, flowers, and stems in the form of anherbal tea. Use twice as much fresh, chopped herb asKEY TERMS\nAlterative —A medicinal substance that acts grad-\nually to nourish and improve the system.\nAntimicrobial —A plant substance that acts to\ninhibit the growth of harmful microorganisms, oracts to destroy them.\nFebrifuge —A plant substance that acts to prevent\nor reduce fever.\nGlycoside —An herbal carbohydrate that exerts\npowerful effect on hormone-producing tissues.The glycoside breaks down into a sugar and anon-sugar component.\nLanceolate —Narrow, leaf shape that is longer\nthan it is wide, and pointed at the end.\nMacrophage —Specialized cells present throughout\nthe lymphoid tissues of the body that circulate in thebloodstream. Macrophages have a surface markerthat stimulates other cells to react to an antigen.dried herb. Steep in 1 pt (0.47 l) of boiled, unchlorinated\nwater for 10–15 minutes. Strain and cover. Drink warm,sweetened with honey if desired. A standard dose is threecups per day. An infusion will keep for up to two days inthe refrigerator and retain its healing qualities.\nA tincture is the usual method to prepare a concen-\ntrated form of the herbal remedy. Tinctures, properly pre-pared and stored, will retain medicinal potency for twoyears or more. Combine 4 oz (114 g) of finely cut freshor powdered dry herb with 1 pt (0.47 l) of brandy, gin, orvodka in a glass container. The alcohol should be enoughto cover the plant parts and have a 50/50 ratio of alcoholto water. Place the mixture away from light for about twoweeks, shaking several times each day. Strain and storein a tightly capped, dark glass bottle. A standard dose is0.14 oz (4 ml ) of the tincture three times a day.\nPrecautions\nEchinacea is considered safe in recommended doses.\nPregnant or lactating women, however, are advised not totake echinacea in injection form. Because the plant hasproven immuno-modulating properties, individuals withsystemic lupus erythmatosus, rheumatoid arthritis ,\ntuberculosis , leukemia, multiple sclerosis , or AIDS\nshould consult their physician before using echinacea.Echinacea should not be given to children under twoyears of age, and it should only be given to children overtwo in consultation with a physician. Research indicatesthat echinacea is most effective when taken at first onsetof symptoms of cold or flu, and when usage is continuedno longer than eight weeks. There is some indication thatthe herb loses its effectiveness when used over a longperiod of time. It is necessary to interrupt use for a mini-mum of several weeks in order to give the body’simmune system the opportunity to rest and adjust.\nSide effects\nNo side effects are reported with oral administration\nof echinacea, either in tincture, capsule, or as a tea, whentaken according to recommended doses. Chills, fever ,\nand allergic reactions have been reported in someresearch studies using an injection of the plant extract.\nInteractions\nNone reported.

One of three forms of the Echinococcus\nspp., E. granulosus , lives on dogs and livestock, and\ninfects humans through contact with these animals. Aller-gic reactions and damage to various organs from cyst for-mation are the most common forms of disease in humans.\nDescription\nE. granulosus is found in many areas of Africa,\nChina, South America, Australia, New Zealand, andMediterranean and eastern Europe, as well as in parts ofthe western United States. The parasite lives in regionswhere dogs and livestock cohabitate. Direct exposure toinfectious dogs as well as parasitic eggs released into theenvironment during shedding are both sources of humaninfection.\nIn humans, cysts containing the larvae develop after\ningestion of eggs. Cysts form primarily in the lungs andliver. Cysts developing in the liver are responsible forabout two-thirds of echinococcosis cases. Echinococco-sis is a significant public health problem in many areas ofKEY TERMS\nAllergenic —A substance capable of causing an\nallergic reaction.\nCholangitis —Infection or inflammation of the bile\nducts; often causes abdominal pain, fever, andjaundice.\nComputed tomography (CT) scan —A specialized\nx-ray procedure in which cross-sections of thearea in question can be examined in detail.\nCyst—A protective sac that includes either fluid or\nthe cell of an organism.

The presence of jaundice is usually, but notalways, a sign of liver disease.\nTapeworm —An intestinal parasite that attaches to\nthe intestine or travels to other organs such as theliver and lungs.\nUltrasound —A noninvasive procedure based on\nchanges in sound waves of a frequency that can-not be heard, but respond to changes in tissuecomposition.\nthe world, but control programs have decreased the rate\nof infection in some regions. In Kenya alone, the num-bers of persons infected each year is as high as 220 per100,000 population.\nCauses and symptoms\nAfter ingestion, the eggs develop into embryos with-\nin the intestines and then travel to the liver and lungsthrough major blood vessels. The embryos then begin toform cysts within the liver and lungs, causing damage asthey enlarge over a period of five to 20 years. Cysts maybecome over 8 in (20.3 cm)or more in size and contain ahuge amount of highly allergenic fluid. Studies show thatwhile the liver is most often targeted, lungs, brain, heart,and bone can also be affected.\nThe major symptoms are due to compression dam-\nage, blockage of vessels and ducts (such as the bileducts), and leakage of fluid from cysts. The followingsymptoms are frequent.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1127EchinococcosisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1127• Liver involvement causes pain and eventually jaundice\nor cholangitis due to blockage of bile ducts. Infection\nof cysts leads to abscesses in up to 20%.\n• Lung cysts cause cough and chest pain.\n• Bone cysts cause fractures and damage to bone tissue.\n• Heart involvement leads to irregularities of heart beat\nand inflammation of the covering of the heart (peri-cardium).\n• Allergic reactions occur from leakage of cyst fluid that\ncontains antigens. Itching ,fever , and rashes are fre-\nquent, and fatal allergic reactions ( anaphylaxis ) have\nbeen reported. Eosinophils, which are blood cellsinvolved in allergic reactions, are increased in manypatients.\nDiagnosis\nX rays, computed tomography scans (CT scans),\nand ultrasound are very helpful in detecting cysts. Somecysts will develop characteristic hardening of organ tis-sues from calcium deposits (calcifications). Blood teststo detect antibodies are useful when positive, but up to50% of patients have negative results. Examination ofaspirated cyst fluid for parasites can be diagnostic, butcarries the danger of a fatal allergic reaction. Treatmentwith anti-parasitic medications before aspiration isreported to decrease allergic complications and decreasethe risk of spread during the procedure.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the size and location of cysts,\nas well as the symptoms they are producing. Surgicalremoval of cysts and/or surrounding tissue is the accept-ed method of treatment, but carries a risk of cyst rupturewith spread or allergic reactions. Recent studies using\nmedication alongside aspiration and drainage of cystsinstead of surgery are very encouraging.\nThe medication albenzadole can be taken before or\nafter surgery or alone without surgery. However, itseffectiveness as a single treatment is still not known.Multiple courses of medication are often necessary,with cure rates of only about 30%. Response to treat-ment is best monitored by serial CT scans or similar x-ray studies.\nPrevention\nGood hand washing, treating infected dogs, and pre-\nventing dogs access to slaughter houses discouragespread of the disease.

    "title": "Echocardiography",
    "content": "Echocardiography\nDefinition\nEchocardiography is a diagnostic test that uses ultra-\nsound waves to create an image of the heart muscle.Ultrasound waves that rebound or echo off the heart canshow the size, shape, and movement of the heart’s valvesand chambers as well as the flow of blood through theheart. Echocardiography may show such abnormalitiesas poorly functioning heart valves or damage to the hearttissue from a past heart attack .\nPurpose\nEchocardiography is used to diagnose certain cardio-\nvascular diseases. In fact, it is one of the most widely useddiagnostic tests for heart disease. It can provide a wealthof helpful information, including the size and shape of theheart, its pumping strength, and the location and extent ofany damage to its tissues. It is especially useful for assess-ing diseases of the heart valves. It not only allows doctorsto evaluate the heart valves, but it can detect abnormalitiesin the pattern of blood flow, such as the backward flow ofblood through partly closed heart valves, known as regur-gitation. By assessing the motion of the heart wall,echocardiography can help detect the presence and assessthe severity of coronary artery disease , as well as help\ndetermine whether any chest pain is related to heart dis-\nease. Echocardiography can also help detect hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy , in which the walls of the heart thicken\nin an attempt to compensate for heart muscle weakness.The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it isnoninvasive (doesn’t involve breaking the skin or enteringbody cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.\nPrecautions\nEchocardiography is an extremely safe procedure\nand no special precautions are required.Description\nEchocardiography creates an image of the heart\nusing ultra-high-frequency sound waves—sound wavesthat are too high in frequency to be heard by the humanear. The technique is very similar to ultrasound scanningcommonly used to visualize the fetus during pregnancy .\nAn echocardiography examination generally lasts\nbetween 15–30 minutes. The patient lies bare-chested onan examination table. A special gel is spread over thechest to help the transducer make good contact and slidesmoothly over the skin. The transducer, a small hand-helddevice at the end of a flexible cable, is placed against thechest. Essentially a modified microphone, the transducerdirects ultrasound waves into the chest. Some of thewaves get echoed (or reflected) back to the transducer.Since different tissues and blood all reflect ultrasoundwaves differently, these sound waves can be translatedinto a meaningful image of the heart, which can be dis-played on a monitor or recorded on paper or tape. Thepatient does not feel the sound waves, and the entire pro-cedure is painless. In fact, there are no known side effects.\nOccasionally, variations of the echocardiography\ntest are used. For example, Doppler echocardiographyemploys a special microphone that allows technicians tomeasure and analyze the direction and speed of bloodflow through blood vessels and heart valves. This makesit especially useful for detecting and evaluating regurgi-tation through the heart valves. By assessing the speed ofblood flow at different locations around an obstruction, itcan also help to precisely locate the obstruction.\nAn exercise echocardiogram is an echocardiogram\nperformed during exercise, when the heart muscle mustwork harder to supply blood to the body.

    "title": "Ectopic pregnancy",
    "content": "Ectopic pregnancy\nDefinition\nIn an ectopic pregnancy , the fertilized egg implants in\na location outside the uterus and tries to develop there. Theword ectopic means “in an abnormal place or position.” Themost common site is the fallopian tube, the tube that nor-mally carries eggs from the ovary to the uterus. However,ectopic pregnancy can also occur in the ovary, the abdomen,and the cervical canal (the opening from the uterus to thevaginal canal). The phrases tubal pregnancy, ovarian preg-nancy, cervical pregnancy, and abdominal pregnancy referto the specific area of an ectopic pregnancy.\nDescription\nOnce a month, an egg is produced in a woman’s ovary\nand travels down the fallopian tube where it meets themale’s sperm and is fertilized. In a normal pregnancy thefertilized egg, or zygote, continues on its passage down thefallopian tube and enters the uterus in three to five days.The zygote continues to grow, implanting itself securely inthe wall of the uterus. The zygote’s cells develop into theembryo (the organism in its first two months of develop-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1130Ectopic pregnancyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1130ment) and placenta (a spongy structure that lines the uterus\nand nourishes the developing organism).\nIn a tubal ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg can-\nnot make it all the way down the tube because of scarringor obstruction. The fallopian tube is too narrow for thegrowing zygote. Eventually the thin walls of the tubestretch and may burst (rupture), resulting in severe bleed-ing and possibly the death of the mother. More than 95%\npercent of all ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopiantube. Only 1.5% develop in the abdomen; less than 1%develop in the ovary or the cervix.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs many as 50% of women with ectopic pregnancies\nhave a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\nThis is an infection of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis)that can spread to the uterus or ovaries. It is most com-monly caused by the organisms Gonorrhea and Chlamy-\ndiaand is usually transmitted by sexual intercourse.\nOther conditions also increase the risk of ectopic\npregnancy. They include:\n•Endometriosis . A condition in which the tissue that\nnormally lines the uterus is found outside the uterus,and can block a fallopian tube.\n• Exposure to diethylsilbestrol (DES) as a fetus. If a\nwoman’s mother took DES (a synthetic version of thehormone estrogen) during pregnancy, the woman mayhave abnormalities in her fallopian tubes that can makeectopic pregnancy more likely.\n• Taking hormones. Estrogen and progesterone are hor-\nmones that regulate the menstrual cycle and may be inmedications prescribed by a doctor for birth control orother reasons. Taking these hormones can affect the inte-rior lining of the fallopian tubes and slow the movementof the fertilized egg down the tube. Women who becomepregnant in spite of taking some progesterone-only con-traceptives have a greater chance of an ectopic pregnan-cy. Ectopic pregnancy is also more likely when theovaries are artificially stimulated with hormones to pro-duce eggs for in vitro fertilization (a procedure in which\neggs are taken from a woman’s body, fertilized, and thenplaced in the uterus in an attempt to conceive a child).\n• Use of an intrauterine device ( IUD). These contracep-\ntive devices are designed to prevent fertilized eggs frombecoming implanted in the uterus, but they have only aminimal effect on preventing ectopic pregnancies.Therefore, if a woman becomes pregnant while usingan IUD for contraception , the fertilized egg is more\nlikely to be implanted someplace other than the uterus.For example, among women who become pregnantwhile using a progesterone-bearing IUD, about 15%have ectopic pregnancies.• Surgery on a fallopian tube. The risk of ectopic preg-\nnancy can be as high as 60% after undergoing electivetubal sterilization, a procedure in which the fallopiantubes are severed to prevent pregnancy. Women whohave successful surgery to reverse the procedure arealso more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy.\nEarly symptoms\nIn an ectopic pregnancy all the hormonal changes\nassociated with a normal pregnancy may occur. The earlysymptoms include: fatigue ; nausea; a missed period; breast\ntenderness; low back pain ; mild cramping on one side of\nthe pelvis; and abnormal vaginal bleeding, usually spotting.\nLater symptoms\nAs the embryo grows too large for the confined\nspace in the tube, the first sign that something is wrongmay be a stabbing pain in the pelvis or abdomen. If the\ntube has ruptured, blood may irritate the diaphragm andcause shoulder pain. Other warning signs are lighthead-edness and fainting .\nDiagnosis\nTo confirm an early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy,\nthe doctor must determine first that the patient is preg-nant and that the location of the embryo is outside theuterus. If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the doctor\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1131Ectopic pregnancy\nOvary\nVaginaUterus\nFallopian tubeEmbryo\nIn an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants in a\nlocation outside the uterus and attempts to develop at thatsite.The most common site of an ectopic pregnancy is thefallopian tube, but it can occur in the ovary, the abdomen,and the cervical wall.

Measurement of thehuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level in thepatient’s blood serum is the most useful laboratory test inthe early stages. In a normal pregnancy, the level of thishormone doubles about every two days during the first10 weeks. In an ectopic pregnancy, the rate of theincrease is much slower and the low hCG for the stage ofthe pregnancy is a strong indication that the pregnancy isabnormal. (It could also represent a miscarriage in\nprogress.) The level is usually tested several times over aperiod of days to determine whether or not it is increas-ing at a normal rate.\nProgesterone levels in the blood are also measured.\nLower than expected levels can indicate that the pregnan-cy is not normal.\nAn ultrasound examination may provide information\nabout whether or not the pregnancy is ectopic.

The sound wavesbounce off of the internal organs and create an image ona screen. The doctor should be able to see whether or notthere is a fetus developing in the uterus after at least fiveweeks of gestation. Before that point, a normal pregnan-cy is too small to see.\nA culdocentesis may also help confirm a diagnosis.\nIn this procedure a needle is inserted into the space at thetop of the vagina, behind the uterus and in front of therectum. Blood in this area may indicate bleeding from aruptured fallopian tube.\nA laparoscopy will enable the doctor to see the\npatient’s reproductive organs and examine an ectopicpregnancy. In this technique, a hollow tube with a lighton one end is inserted through a small incision in theabdomen. Through this instrument the internal organscan be observed.\nTreatment\nEctopic pregnancy requires immediate treatment.\nThe earlier the condition is treated, the better the chanceto preserve the fallopian tube intact for future normalpregnancies.\nMedical\nIf the ectopic pregnancy is discovered in a very early\nstage of development, the drug methotrexate may begiven. The best results are obtained when the pregnancyis less than six weeks old and the tubal mass is no morethan 1.4 in (3.5 cm) in diameter. Methotrexate, which hasbeen used successfully since 1987, works by inhibitingthe growth of rapidly growing cells. (It is also used totreat some cancers.) Most side effects are mild and tem-porary, but the patient must be monitored after treatment.Usually the medication is injected into the muscle in asingle dose, but may also be given intravenously orinjected directly into the fallopian tube to dissolve theembryonic tissue. Methotrexate has also been used totreat ovarian, abdominal, and cervical pregnancies thatare discovered in the early stages.\nSurgical\nWhen a laparoscopy is done to visualize the ectopic\npregnancy, the scope can be fitted with surgical tools andused to remove the ectopic mass immediately after it isidentified. The affected fallopian tube can be repaired orremoved as necessary. This procedure can be done with-out requiring the patient to stay in the hospital overnight.\nWhen the pregnancy has ruptured, a surgical inci-\nsion into the abdomen, or laparotomy, is performed to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1132Catch WordGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1132stop the immediate loss of blood and to remove the\nembryo. This usually requires general anesthesia and ahospital stay. Every effort is made to preserve and repairthe injured fallopian tube. However, if the fallopian tubehas already ruptured, repair is extremely difficult and thetube is usually removed.\nAlternative treatment\nEctopic pregnancy was first described in the eleventh\ncentury and was a potentially fatal condition until theadvent of surgery and blood transfusions in the earlytwentieth century. The sophisticated diagnostic tools andsurgical procedures developed since the 1970s haveequipped modern medicine with the tools to not only savea woman’s life, but also to preserve her future fertility.\nAlthough there are herbal remedies for the tempo-\nrary relief of the common symptoms of anxiety and\nabdominal discomfort, prompt medical treatment is theonly sure remedy for ectopic pregnancy.\nPrognosis\nEctopic pregnancies are the leading cause of preg-\nnancy-related deaths in the first trimester and account for9% of all pregnancy-related deaths in the United States.More than 1% of pregnancies are ectopic, and they arebecoming more common. The reason for this increase isnot clearly understood, though it is thought that the dra-matic increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STD)\nis at least partly responsible.\nThe earlier an ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed and\ntreated, the better the outcome. The chances of having asuccessful pregnancy are lower after an ectopic pregnan-cy, but depend on the extent of permanent fallopian tubedamage. If the tube has been spared, chances are as highas 60%. The chances of a successful pregnancy after theremoval of one tube are 40%.\nPrevention\nMany forms of ectopic pregnancy cannot be prevent-\ned. However, tubal pregnancies, which make up the major-ity of ectopic pregnancies, may be prevented by avoidingconditions that cause damage to the fallopian tubes. Sincehalf of all women who experience ectopic pregnancy havea history of PID, avoiding this infection or getting earlydiagnosis and treatment for sexually transmitted diseaseswill decrease the risk of a future problem.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCunningham, F.

    "title": "Edema",
    "content": "Edema\nDefinition\nEdema is a condition of abnormally large fluid vol-\nume in the circulatory system or in tissues between thebody’s cells (interstitial spaces).\nDescription\nNormally the body maintains a balance of fluid in\ntissues by ensuring that the same of amount of waterentering the body also leaves it. The circulatory systemtransports fluid within the body via its network of bloodvessels. The fluid, which contains oxygen and nutrientsneeded by the cells, moves from the walls of the bloodvessels into the body’s tissues. After its nutrients are usedup, fluid moves back into the blood vessels and returns tothe heart. The lymphatic system (a network of channelsin the body that carry lymph, a colorless fluid containingwhite blood cells to fight infection) also absorbs andtransports this fluid. In edema, either too much fluidmoves from the blood vessels into the tissues, or notenough fluid moves from the tissues back into the bloodvessels. This fluid imbalance can cause mild to severeswelling in one or more parts of the body.\nCauses and symptoms\nMany ordinary factors can upset the balance of fluid\nin the body to cause edema, including:\n• Immobility. The leg muscles normally contract and\ncompress blood vessels to promote blood flow withwalking or running. When these muscles are not used,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1133EdemaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1133blood can collect in the veins, making it difficult for\nfluid to move from tissues back into the vessels.\n• Heat. Warm temperatures cause the blood vessels to\nexpand, making it easier for fluid to cross into sur-rounding tissues. High humidity also aggravates thissituation.\n• Medications. Certain drugs, such as steroids, hormone\nreplacements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAIDs), and some blood pressure medications mayaffect how fast fluid leaves blood vessels.\n• Intake of salty foods. The body needs a constant con-\ncentration of salt in its tissues. When excess salt istaken in, the body dilutes it by retaining fluid.\n• Menstruation and pregnancy . The changing levels of\nhormones affect the rate at which fluid enters andleaves the tissues.\nSome medical conditions may also cause edema,\nincluding:\n•Heart failure . When the heart is unable to maintain\nadequate blood flow throughout the circulatory system,the excess fluid pressure within the blood vessels cancause shifts into the interstitial spaces. Left-sided heart\nfailure can cause pulmonary edema , as fluid shifts into\nthe lungs. The patient may develop rapid, shallow res-pirations, shortness of breath , and a cough . Right-\nsided heart failure can cause pitting edema, a swellingin the tissue under the skin of the lower legs and feet.Pressing this tissue with a finger tip leads to a notice-able momentary indentation.\n• Kidney disease. The decrease in sodium and water\nexcretion can result in fluid retention and overload.\n• Thyroid or liver disease. These conditions can change\nthe concentration of protein in the blood, affecting fluidmovement in and out of the tissues. In advanced liverdisease, the liver is enlarged and fluid may build-up inthe abdomen.\n• Malnutrition. Protein levels are decreased in the blood,\nand in an effort to maintain a balance of concentrations,fluid shifts out of the vessels and causes edema in tissuespaces.\nSome conditions that may cause swelling in just one\nleg include:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1134Edema\nGross lymphedema in the arm of an elderly woman following radiotherapy treatment for breast cancer.

Clots can cause pooling of fluid and may\nbe accompanied by discoloration and pain . In some\ninstances, clots may cause no pain.\n• Weakened veins. Varicose veins , or veins whose walls\nor valves are weak, can allow blood to pool in the legs.This is a common condition.\n• Infection and inflammation. Infection in leg tissues can\ncause inflammation and increasing blood flow to thearea. Inflammatory diseases, such as gout or arthritis,\ncan also result in swelling.\n•Lymphedema . Blocked lymph channels may be caused\nby infection, scar tissue, or hereditary conditions.Lymph that can’t drain properly results in edema. Lym-phedema may also occur after cancer treatments, when\nthe lymph system is impaired by surgery, radiation, orchemotherapy .\n• Tumor. Abnormal masses can compress leg vessels and\nlymph channels, affecting the rate of fluid movement.\nSymptoms vary depending on the cause of edema. In\ngeneral, weight gain, puffy eyelids, and swelling of thelegs may occur as a result of excess fluid volume. Pulserate and blood pressure may be elevated. Hand and neckveins may be observed as fuller.\nDiagnosis\nEdema is a sign of an underlying problem, rather\nthan a disease unto itself. A diagnostic explanationshould be sought. Patient history and presenting symp-toms, along with laboratory blood studies, if indicated,assist the health professional in determining the cause ofthe edema.\nTreatment\nTreatment of edema is based on the cause. Simple\nsteps to lessen fluid build-up may include:\n• Reducing sodium intake. A high sodium level causes or\naggravates fluid retention.\n• Maintaining proper weight. Being overweight slows\nbody fluid circulation and puts extra pressure on theveins.\n•Exercise . Regular exercise stimulates circulation.\n• Elevation of the legs. Placing the legs at least 12 in\n(30.5 cm) above the level of the heart for 10–15 min-utes, three to four times a day, stimulates excess fluidre-entry into the circulatory system.\n• Use of support stocking. Elastic stockings, available at\nmost medical supply or drug stores, will compress theleg vessels, promoting circulation and decreasing pool-ing of fluid due to gravity.KEY TERMS\nDigitalis —A naturally occuring compound used in\nthe preparation of the medication, digoxin, pre-scribed to increase the heart rate and strengthenthe force of the heart’s contractions.\nDiuretics —Medications used in the treatment of\nfluid overload, to promote excretion of sodiumand water.\nInterstitial spaces —Areas of the body occuring\noutside the vessels or organs, between the cells.\nPitting edema —A swelling in the tissue under the\nskin, resulting from fluid accumulation, that ismeasured by the depth of indentation made by fin-ger pressure over a boney prominence.\n• Massage. Massaging the body part can help to stimu-\nlate the release of excess fluids, but should be avoidedif the patient has blood clots in the veins.\n• Travel breaks. Sitting for long periods will increase\nswelling in the feet and ankles. Standing and/or walk-ing at least every hour or two will help stimulate bloodflow.\nThe three “Ds”—diuretics, digitalis, and diet—are\nfrequently prescribed for medical conditions that resultin excess fluid volume. Diuretics are medications that\npromote urination of sodium and water. Digoxin is a dig-italis preparation that is sometimes needed to decreaseheart rate and increase the strength of the heart’s contrac-tions. Dietary recommendations include less sodium inorder to decrease fluid retention. Consideration of ade-quate protein intake is also made.\nFor patients with lymphedema, a combination of\ntherapies may prove effective. Combined decongestivetherapy includes the use of manual lymph drainage(MLD), compression bandaging, garments and pumps,and physical therapy. MLD involves the use of lightmassage of the subcutaneous tissue where the lymphvessels predominate. Massage begins in an area of thebody trunk where there is normal lymph function andproceeds to areas of lymphatic insufficiency, in aneffort to stimulate new drainage tract development.(MLD should not be used for patients with active can-cer, deep vein clots, congestive heart failure, or cel-lulitis.) MLD sessions are followed by application ofcompression garments or pumps. Physical therapy isaimed at strengthening the affected limb and increas-ing joint mobility.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1135EdemaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1135Alternative treatment\nDietary changes, in addition to cutting back the\namount of sodium eaten, may also help reduce edema.Foods that worsen edema, such as alcohol, caffeine ,\nsugar, dairy products, soy sauce, animal protein, choco-late, olives, and pickles, should be avoided. Diuretic herbscan also help relieve edema. One of the best herbs for thispurpose is dandelion ( Taraxacum mongolicum ), since, in\naddition to its diuretic action, it is a rich source of potassi-um. (Diuretics flush potassium from the body and it mustbe replaced to avoid potassium deficiency.)

The extra chromosome is lethal for most babiesborn with this condition. It causes major physical abnor-malities and severe mental retardation , and very few chil-\ndren afflicted with this disease survive beyond a year.\nDescription\nHumans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes.\nChromosomes are numbered 1–22, and the 23rd pair iscomposed of the sex chromosomes, X and Y . A personinherits one set of 23 chromosomes from each parent.Occasionally, a genetic error occurs during egg orsperm cell formation. A child conceived with such anegg or sperm cell may inherit an incorrect number ofchromosomes.\nIn the case of Edwards’ syndrome, the child inherits\nthree, rather than two, copies of chromosome 18. Trisomy18 occurs in approximately one in every 3,000 newbornsand affects girls more often than boys. Women older thantheir early thirties have a greater risk of conceiving a childwith trisomy 18, but it can occur in younger women.\nCauses and symptoms\nA third copy of chromosome 18 causes numerous\nabnormalities. Most children born with Edwards’ syn-drome appear weak and fragile, and they are often under-weight. The head is unusually small and the back of thehead is prominent. The ears are malformed and low-set,and the mouth and jaw are small. The baby may alsohave a cleft lip or cleft palate. Frequently, the hands areclenched into fists, and the index finger overlaps theother fingers. The child may have clubfeet and toes maybe webbed or fused.\nNumerous problems involving the internal organs\nmay be present. Abnormalities often occur in the lungsand diaphragm (the muscle that controls breathing), andheart defects and blood vessel malformations are com-mon. The child may also have malformed kidneys andabnormalities of the urogenital system.\nDiagnosis\nPhysical abnormalities point to Edwards’ syndrome,\nbut definitive diagnosis relies on karyotyping. Karyotyp-ing involves drawing the baby’s blood or bone marrowfor a microscopic examination of the chromosomes.Using special stains and microscopy, individual chromo-somes are identified, and the presence of an extra chro-mosome 18 is revealed.\nTrisomy 18 can be detected before birth. If a preg-\nnant woman is older than 35, has a family history ofgenetic abnormalities, has previously conceived a childwith a genetic abnormality, or has suffered earlier miscar-riages, she may undergo tests to determine whether herchild carries genetic abnormalities. Potential tests includematernal serum analysis or screening, ultrasonography,amniocentesis , and chorionic villus sampling .\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for Edwards’ syndrome. Since tri-\nsomy 18 babies frequently have major physical abnor-malities, doctors and parents face difficult choicesregarding treatment. Abnormalities can be treated to acertain degree with surgery, but extreme invasive proce-dures may not be in the best interests of an infant whoselifespan is measured in days or weeks. Medical therapyoften consists of supportive care with the goal of makingthe infant comfortable, rather than prolonging life.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1136Edwards’ syndromeGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1136Prognosis\nMost children born with trisomy 18 die within their\nfirst year of life. The average lifespan is less than twomonths for 50% of the children, and 90–95% die beforetheir first birthday. The 5–10% of children who survivetheir first year are severely mentally retarded. They needsupport to walk, and learning is limited. Verbal commu-nication is also limited, but they can learn to recognizeand interact with others.\nPrevention\nEdwards’ syndrome cannot be prevented.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGardner, R. J.

    "content": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nDefinition\nThe Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) refer to a\ngroup of inherited disorders that affect collagen structureand function. Genetic abnormalities in the manufacturingof collagen within the body affect connective tissues,causing them to be abnormally weak.\nDescription\nCollagen is a strong, fibrous protein that lends\nstrength and elasticity to connective tissues such as the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1137Ehlers-Danlos syndromeGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1137skin, tendons, organ walls, cartilage, and blood vessels.\nEach of these connective tissues requires collagen tai-lored to meet its specific purposes. The many roles ofcollagen are reflected in the number of genes dedicatedto its production. There are at least 28 genes in humansthat encode at least 19 different types of collagen. Muta-tions in these genes can affect basic construction as wellas the fine-tuned processing of the collagen.\nEDS was originally described by Dr. Van Meekeren\nin 1682. Dr. Ehlers and Dr. Danlos further characterizedthe disease in 1901 and 1908, respectively. Today,according to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation, onein 5,000 to one in 10,000 people are affected by someform of EDS.\nEDS is a group of genetic disorders that usually\naffects the skin, ligaments, joints, and blood vessels. Clas-sification of EDS types was revised in 1997. The newclassification involves categorizing the different forms ofEDS into six major sub-types, including classical, hyper-mobility, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasia, anddermatosparaxis, and a collection of rare or poorlydefined varieties. This new classification is simpler andbased more on descriptions of the actual symptoms.\nClassical type\nUnder the old classification system, EDS classical\ntype was divided into two separate types: type I and typeII. The major symptoms involved in EDS classical typeare the skin and joints. The skin has a smooth, velvetytexture and bruises easily. Affected individuals typically\nhave extensive scaring, particularly at the knees, elbows,forehead, and chin. The joints are hyperextensible, givinga tendency towards dislocation of the hip, shoulder,elbow, knee, or clavicle. Due to decreased muscle tone,affected infants may experience a delay in reaching motormilestones. Children may have a tendency to develop her-nias or other organ shifts within the abdomen. Sprains andpartial or complete joint dilocations are also common.Symptoms can range from mild to severe. EDS classicaltype is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\nThere are three major clinical diagnostic criteria for\nEDS classical type. These include skin hyperextensibili-ty, unusually wide scars, and joint hypermobility. At thistime there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of classi-cal EDS. Both DNA and biochemical studies have beenused to help identify affected individuals. In some cases,a skin biopsy has been found to be useful in confirming\na diagnosis. Unfortunately, these tests are not sensitiveenough to identify all individuals with classical EDS. Ifthere are multiple affected individuals in a family, it maybe possible to perform prenatal diagnosis using a DNAinformation technique known as a linkage study.Hypermobility type\nExcessively loose joints are the hallmark of this EDS\ntype, formerly known as EDS type III. Both large joints,such as the elbows and knees, and small joints, such astoes and fingers, are affected. Partial and total joint dislo-cations are common, and particularly involve the jaw,knee, and shoulder. Many individuals experience chroniclimb and joint pain, although x rays of these joints appear\nnormal. The skin may also bruise easily. Osteoarthritis is\na common occurrence in adults. EDS hypermobility typeis inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\nThere are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for\nEDS hypermobility type. These include skin involvement(either hyperextensible skin or smooth and velvety skin)and generalized joint hypermobility. At this time there isno test for this form of EDS.\nV ascular type\nFormerly called EDS type IV, EDS vascular type is\nthe most severe form. The connective tissue in theintestines, arteries, uterus, and other hollow organs maybe unusually weak, leading to organ or blood vessel rup-ture. Such ruptures are most likely between ages 20 and40, although they can occur any time, and may be life-threatening.\nThere is a classic facial appearance associated with\nEDS vascular type. Affected individuals tend to havelarge eyes, a thin pinched nose, thin lips, and a slim body.The skin is thin and translucent, with veins dramaticallyvisible, particularly across the chest.\nThe large joints have normal stability, but small\njoints in the hands and feet are loose, showing hyperex-tensibility. The skin bruises easily. Other complicationsmay include collapsed lungs, premature aging of the skin\non the hands and feet, and ruptured arteries and veins.After surgery there tends to be poor wound healing, acomplication that tends to be frequent and severe. Preg-\nnancy also carries the risk complications. During and\nafter pregnancy there is an increased risk of the uterusrupturing and of arterial bleeding. Due to the severe com-plications associated with EDS type IV , death usually\noccurs before the fifth decade. A study of 419 individualswith EDS vascular type, completed in 2000, found thatthe median survival rate was 48 years, with a range of sixto 73 years. EDS vascular type is inherited in an autoso-mal dominant manner.\nThere are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for\nEDS vascular type. These include thin translucent skin,arterial/intestinal/uterine fragility or rupture, extensivebruising, and characteristic facial appearance. EDS vascu-lar type is caused by a change in the gene COL3A1,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1138Ehlers-Danlos syndromeGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1138which codes for one of the collagen chains used to build\nCollage type III. Laboratory testing is available for thisform of EDS. A skin biopsy may be used to demonstratethe structurally abnormal collagen. This type of biochem-ical test identifies more than 95% of individuals with EDSvascular type. Laboratory testing is recommended forindividuals with two or more of the major criteria.\nDNA analysis may als be used to identify the change\nwithin the COL3A1 gene. This information may be help-ful for genetic counseling purposes. Prenatal testing is\navailable for pregnancies in which an affected parent hasbeen identified and their DNA mutation is known or theirbiochemical defect has been demonstrated.\nKyphoscoliosis type\nThe major symptoms of kyphoscoliosis type, for-\nmerly called EDS type VI, are general joint looseness. Atbirth, the muscle tone is poor, and motor skill develop-ment is subsequently delayed. Also, infants with this typeof EDS have an abnormal curvature of the spine ( scolio-\nsis). The scoliosis becomes progressively worse with\nage, with affected individuals usually unable to walk byage 20. The eyes and skin are fragile and easily damaged,and blood vessel involvement is a possibility. The bonesmay also be affected as demonstrated by a decrease inbone mass. Kyphoscoliosis type is inherited in an autoso-mal recessive manner.\nThere are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for\nEDS kyphoscoliosis type. These include generaly loosejoints, low muscle tone at birth, scoliosis at birth (whichworsens with age), and a fragility of the eyes, which maygive the white area of the eye a blue tint or cause the eyeto rupture. This form of EDS is caused by a change in thePLOD gene on chromosome 1, which encodes theenzyme lysyl hydroxylase. A laboratory test is availablein which urinary hydroxylysyl pryridinoline is measured.This test, performed on urine is extremely senstive andspecific for EDS kyphoscolios type. Laboratory testing isrecommended for infants with three or more of the majordiagnostic criteria.\nPrenatal testing is available if a pregnancy is known\nto be at risk and an identified affected family member hashad positive laboratory testing. An amniocentesis may\nbe performed in which fetal cells are removed from theamniotic fluid and enzyme activity is measured.\nArthrochalasia type\nDislocation of the hip joint typically accompanies\narthrochalasia type EDS, formerly called EDS type VIIB.Other joints are also unusually loose, leading to recurrentpartial and total dislocations. The skin has a high degreeof stretchability and bruises easily. Individuals with thistype of EDS may also experience mildly diminished\nbone mass, scoliosis, and poor muscle tone. Arthrochala-sia type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\nThere are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for\nEDS arthrochalasia type. These include sever general-ized joing hypermobility and bilateral hip dislocationpresent at birth. This form of EDS is caused by a changein either of two components of Collage type I, calledproa1(I) type A and proa2(I) type B. A skin biopsy maybe preformed to demonstrate an abnormality in eithercomponents. Direct DNA testing is also available.\nDermatosparaxis type\nIndividuals with this type of EDS, once called type\nVIIC, have extremely fragile skin that bruises easily butdoes not scar excessively. The skin is soft and may sag,leading to an aged appearance even in young adults. Indi-viduals may also experience hernias. Dermatosparaxistype is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.\nThere are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for\nEDS dematosparaxis type. These include severe skinfragility and sagging or aged appearing skin. This form ofEDS is caused by a change in the enzyme called procolla-gen I N-terminal peptidase. A skin biopsy may be pre-formed for a definitive diagnosis of Dermatosparaxis type.\nOther types\nThere are several other forms of EDS that have not\nbeen as clearly defined as the aforementioned types.Forms of EDS within this category may present withsoft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronicdiarrhea , joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder\nrupture, or poor wound healing. Inheritance patternswithin this group include X-linked recessive, autosomaldominant, and autosomal recessive.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1139Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nElasticity of the skin is one characteristic of this rare disor-\nder.(Photograph by Biophoto Associates, Photo Researchers,\nInc. Reproduced by permission.)GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1139Causes and symptoms\nThere are numerous types of EDS, all caused by\nchanges in one of several genes. The manner in which EDSis inherited depends on the specific gene involved. Thereare three patterns of inheritance for EDS: autosomal domi-nant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked (extremely rare).\nChromosomes are made up of hundreds of small\nunits known as genes, which contain the genetic materialnecessary for an individual to develop and function.Humans have 46 chromosomes, which are matched into23 pairs. Because chromosomes are inherited in pairs,each individual receives two copies of each chromosomeand likewise two copies of each gene.\nChanges or mutations in genes can cause genetic\ndiseases in several different ways, many of which arerepresented within the spectrum of EDS. In autosomaldominant EDS, only one copy of a specific gene must bechanged for a person to have EDS. In autosomal reces-sive EDS, both copies of a specific gene must be changedfor a person to have EDS. If only one copy of an autoso-mal recessive EDS gene is changed the person is referredto as a carrier, meaning they do not have any of the signsor symptoms of the disease itself, but carry the possibili-KEY TERMS\nArthrochalasia —Excessive loosness of the joints.\nBlood vessels —General term for arteries, veins, and\ncapillaries that transport blood throughout the body.\nCartilage —Supportive connective tissue that cush-\nions bone at the joints or which connects muscle tobone.\nCollagen —The main supportive protein of cartilage,\nconnective tissue, tendon, skin, and bone.\nConnective tissue —A group of tissues responsible\nfor support throughout the body; includes cartilage,bone, fat, tissue underlying skin, and tissues thatsupport organs, blood vessels, and nerves through-out the body.\nDermatosparaxis —Skin fragility caused by abnor-\nmal collagen.\nHernia —A rupture in the wall of a body cavity,\nthrough which an organ may protrude.\nHomeopathic —A holistic and natural approach to\nhealthcare.\nHyperextensibility —The ability to extend a joint\nbeyond the normal range.Hypermobility —Unusual flexibility of the joints,\nallowing them to be bent or moved beyond theirnormal range of motion.\nJoint dislocation —The displacement of a bone.\nKyphoscoliosis —Abnormal front-to-back and side-\nto-side curvature of the spine.\nLigament —A type of connective tissue that con-\nnects bones or cartilage and provides support andstrength to joints.\nOsteoarthritis —A degenerative joint disease that\ncauses pain and stiffness.\nScoliosis —An abnormal, side-to-side curvature of\nthe spine.\nTendon —A strong connective tissue that connects\nmuscle to bone.\nUterus —A muscular, hollow organ of the female\nreproductive tract.

In X-\nlinked EDS a specific gene on the X chromosome mustbe changed. However, this affects males and females dif-ferently because males and females have a different num-ber of X chromosomes.\nAs of 2001 the few X-linked forms of EDS fall under\nthe category of X-linked recessive. As with autosomalrecessive, this implies that both copies of a specific genemust be changed for a person to be affected. However,because males only have one X-chromosome, they areaffected if an X-linked recessive EDS gene is changed ontheir single X-chromosome. That is, they are affectedeven though they have only one changed copy. On theother hand, that same gene must be changed on both ofthe X-chromosomes in a female for her to be affected.\nAlthough there is much information regarding the\nchanges in genes that cause EDS and their various inheri-tance patterns, the exact gene mutation for all types ofEDS is not known.\nDiagnosis\nClinical symptoms such as extreme joint looseness\nand unusual skin qualities, along with family history, can\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1140Ehlers-Danlos syndromeGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1140lead to a diagnosis of EDS. Specific tests, such as skin\nbiopsies are available for diagnosis of certain types ofEDS, including vascular, arthrochalasia, and der-matosparaxis types. A skin biopsy involves removing asmall sample of skin and examining its microscopic struc-ture. A urine test is available for the Kyphoscoliosis type.\nManagement of all types of EDS may include genet-\nic counseling to help the affected individual and theirfamily understand the disorder and its impact on otherfamily members and future children.\nIf a couple has had a child diagnosed with EDS the\nchance that they will have another child with the samedisorder depends on with what form of EDS the child hasbeen diagnosed and if either parent is affected by thesame disease or not.\nIndividuals diagnosed with an autosomal dominant\nform of EDS have a 50% chance of passing the same disor-der on to a child in each pregnancy. Individuals diagnosedwith an autosomal recessive form of EDS have an extreme-ly low risk of having a child with the same disorder.\nX-linked recessive EDS is accompanied by a slight-\nly more complicated pattern of inheritance. If a fatherwith an X-linked recessive form of EDS passes a copy ofhis X chromosome to his children, the sons will be unaf-fected and the daughters will be carriers. If a mother is acarrier for an X-linked recessive form of EDS, she mayhave affected or unaffected sons, or carrier or unaffecteddaughters, depending on the second sex chromosomeinherited from the father.\nPrenatal diagnosis is available for specific forms of\nEDS, including kyphosocliosis type and vascular type.However, prenatal testing is only a possibility in thesetypes if the underlying defect has been found in anotherfamily member.\nTreatment\nMedical therapy relies on managing symptoms and\ntrying to prevent further complications. There is no curefor EDS.\nBraces may be prescribed to stabilize joints, although\nsurgery is sometimes necessary to repair joint damagecaused by repeated dislocations. Physical therapy teachesindividuals how to strengthen muscles around joints andmay help to prevent or limit damage. Elective surgery isdiscouraged due to the high possibility of complications.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are anecdotal reports that large daily doses\n0.04–0.14 oz (1–4 g) of vitamin C may help decreasebruising and aid in wound healing. Constitutional home-opathic treatment may be helpful in maintaining optimal\nhealth in persons with a diagnosis of EDS. An individualwith EDS should discuss these types of therapies withtheir doctor before beginning them on their own. Thera-py that does not require medical consultation involvesprotecting the skin with sunscreen and avoiding activitiesthat place stress on the joints.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for individuals with EDS depends on\nthe type of EDS with which they have been diagnosed.Symptoms vary in severity, even within one sub-type,and the frequency of complications changes on an indi-vidual basis. Some individuals have negligible symptomswhile others are severely restricted in their daily life.Extreme joint instability and scoliosis may limit a per-son’s mobility. Most individuals will have a normal lifes-pan. However, those with blood vessel involvement, par-ticularly those with EDS vascular type, have an increasedrisk of fatal complications.\nEDS is a lifelong condition. Affected individuals\nmay face social obstacles related to their disease on adaily basis. Some people with EDS have reported livingwith fears of significant and painful skin ruptures,becoming pregnant (especially those with EDS vasculartype), their condition worsening, becoming unemployeddue to physical and emotional burdens, and socialstigmatization in general.\nConstant bruises, skin wounds , and trips to the hos-\npital take their toll on both affected children and theirparents. Prior to diagnosis parents of children with EDShave found themselves under suspicion of child abuse .\nSome people with EDS are not diagnosed until well\ninto adulthood and, in the case of EDS vascular type,occasionally not until after death due to complications ofthe disorder. Not only may the diagnosis itself be devas-tating to the family, but in many cases other family mem-bers find out for the first time they are at risk for beingaffected.\nAlthough individuals with EDS face significant\nchallenges, it is important to remember that each personis unique with their own distinguished qualities andpotential. Persons with EDS go on to have families, tohave careers, and to be accomplished citizens, surmount-ing the challenges of their disease.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\n“Clinical and Genetic Features of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome\nType IV , the Vascular Type.” The New England Journal of\nMedicine 342, no. 10 (2000).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1141Ehlers-Danlos syndromeGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1141“Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes: Revised Nosology, Villefranche,\n1997.” American Journal of Medical Genetics 77 (1998):\n31–37.\n“Living a Restricted Life with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.”\nInternational Journal of Nursing Studies 37 (2000):\n111–118.\nORGANIZATIONS\nElhers-Danlos National Foundation. 6399 Wilshire Blvd., Ste\n203, Los Angeles, CA 90048 (323) 651-3038.

    "title": "Ehrlichiosis",
    "content": "Ehrlichiosis\nDefinition\nEhrlichiosis is a bacterial infection that is spread by\nticks. Symptoms include fever , chills, headache , muscle\naches, and tiredness.\nDescription\nEhrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by infec-\ntion with Ehrlichia bacteria. Ticks are small, blood-suck-\ning arachnids. Although some ticks carry disease-causingorganisms, most do not. When an animal or person is bit-ten by a tick that carries bacteria, the bacteria are passedto that person or animal during the tick’s feeding process.It is believed that the tick must remain attached to theperson or animal for at least 24 hours to spread the infec-tion.\nThere are two forms of ehrlichiosis in the United\nStates; human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human gran-ulocytic ehrlichiosis. Monocytic ehrlichiosis is causedby Ehrlichia chaffeensis , which is spread by the Lone\nStar tick, Amblyomma americanum . As of early 1998,\nabout 400 cases of monocytic ehrlichiosis had beenreported in 30 states, primarily in the southeastern andsouth central United States. The bacteria that causesgranulocytic ehrlichiosis is not known, but suspected tobe either Ehrlichia equi or Ehrlichia phagocytophila .\nGranulocytic ehrlichiosis is probably spread by theblacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis (which also spreads\nLyme disease ). About 100 cases of granulocytic ehrli-\nchiosis have been reported in Connecticut, Massachu-setts, Rhode Island, Minnesota, New York, and Wiscon-sin.\nCauses and symptoms\nBoth forms of ehrlichiosis have similar symptoms,\nand the illnesses can range from mild to severe and life-threatening. Risk factors include old age and exposure toticks through work or recreation. Symptoms occur sevento 21 days following a tick bite although patients may notrecall being bitten. Fever, tiredness, headache, muscleaches, chills, loss of appetite, confusion, nausea, andvomiting are common to both diseases. A rash mayoccur.\nDiagnosis\nEhrlichiosis may be diagnosed and treated by doc-\ntors who specialize in blood diseases (hematologists) oran infectious disease specialist. Because ehrlichiosis isnot very common and the symptoms are not unique, itmay be misdiagnosed. A recent history of a tick bite ishelpful in the diagnosis. Blood tests will be done to lookfor antibodies to Ehrlichia . Staining and microscopic\nexamination of the blood sample may show Ehrlichia\nbacteria inside white blood cells. Another test, calledpolymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a very sensitiveassay to detect bacteria in the blood sample, but it is notalways available.\nTreatment\nAntibiotic treatment should begin immediately if\nehrlichiosis is suspected, even if laboratory results arenot available. Treatment with either tetracycline(Sumycin, Achromycin V) or doxycycline (Monodox,Vibramycin) is recommended. Many patients with ehrli-chiosis are admitted to the hospital for treatment.\nPrognosis\nFor otherwise healthy people, a full recovery is\nexpected following treatment for ehrlichiosis. Elderlypatients are at a higher risk for severe disease, which maybe fatal. Serious complications include lung or gastroin-testinal bleeding. Two to 10 patients out of 100 die fromthe disease.\nPrevention\nThe only prevention for ehrlichiosis is to minimize\nexposure to ticks by staying on the trail when walkingthrough the woods, avoiding tall grasses, wearing longsleeves and tucking pant legs into socks, wearing insect\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1142EhrlichiosisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1142repellent, and checking for ticks after an outing.

    "title": "Electric shock injuries",
    "content": "Electric shock injuries\nDefinition\nElectric shock injuries are caused by lightning or\nelectric current from a mechanical source passingthrough the body.\nDescription\nElectric shocks are responsible for about 1,000\ndeaths in the United States each year, or about 1% of allaccidental deaths.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe severity of injury depends on the current’s pres-\nsure (voltage), the amount of current (amperage), thetype of current (direct vs. alternating), the body’s resis-tance to the current, the current’s path through the body,and how long the body remains in contact with the cur-rent. The interplay of these factors can produce effectsranging from barely noticeable tingling to instant death ;\nevery part of the body is vulnerable. Although the severi-KEY TERMS\nTick-borne disease —A disease that is spread to\nanimals by the bite of an infected tick.ty of injury is determined primarily by the voltage, low\nvoltage can be just as dangerous as high voltage underthe right circumstances. People have been killed byshocks of just 50 volts.\nHow electric shocks affect the skin is determined by\nthe skin’s resistance, which in turn is dependent upon thewetness, thickness, and cleanliness of the skin. Thin or wetskin is much less resistant than thick or dry skin. Whenskin resistance is low, the current may cause little or noskin damage but severely burn internal organs and tissues.Conversely, high skin resistance can produce severe skinburns but prevent the current from entering the body.\nThe nervous system (the brain, spinal cord, and\nnerves) is particularly vulnerable to injury. In fact, neuro-logical problems are the most common kind of nonlethalharm suffered by electric shock victims. Some neurologicaldamage is minor and clears up on its own or with medicaltreatment, but some is severe and permanent. Neurologicalproblems may be apparent immediately after the accident,or gradually develop over a period of up to three years.\nDamage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems\nis most acute at the moment of injury. Electric shocks canparalyze the respiratory system or disrupt heart action,causing instant death. Also at risk are the smaller veins andarteries, which dissipate heat less easily than the largerblood vessels and can develop blood clots. Damage to thesmaller vessels is probably one reason why amputation is\noften required following high-voltage injuries.\nMany other sorts of injuries are possible after an\nelectric shock, including cataracts , kidney failure, and\nsubstantial destruction of muscle tissue. The victim maysuffer a fall or be hit by debris from exploding equip-ment. An electric arc may set clothing or nearby flamma-ble substances on fire. Strong shocks are often accompa-nied by violent muscle spasms that can break and dislo-cate bones. These spasms can also freeze the victim inplace and prevent him or her from breaking away fromthe source of the current.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis relies on gathering information about the\ncircumstances of the accident, a thorough physical exami-\nnation , and monitoring of cardiovascular and kidney activ-\nity. The victim’s neurological condition can fluctuate rapid-ly and requires close observation. A computed tomographyscan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nmay be necessary to check for brain injury.\nTreatment\nWhen an electric shock accident happens at home or\nin the workplace, the main power should immediately be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1143Electric shock injuriesGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1143shut off. If that cannot be done, and current is still flowing\nthrough the victim, the alternative is to stand on a dry, non-conducting surface such as a folded newspaper, flattenedcardboard carton, or plastic or rubber mat and use a non-conducting object such as a wooden broomstick (never adamp or metallic object) to push the victim away from thesource of the current. The victim and the source of the cur-rent must not be touched while the current is still flowing,for this can electrocute the rescuer. Emergency medicalhelp should be summoned as quickly as possible. Peoplewho are trained to perform cardiopulmonary resuscita-\ntion (CPR ) should, if appropriate, begin first aid while\nwaiting for emergency medical help to arrive.\nBurn victims usually require treatment at a burn cen-\nter. Fluid replacement therapy is necessary to restore lostfluids and electrolytes. Severely injured tissue is repairedsurgically, which can involve skin grafting or amputa-\ntion. Antibiotics and antibacterial creams are used to\nprevent infection. Victims may also require treatment forkidney failure. Following surgery, physical therapy tofacilitate recovery, and psychological counseling to copewith disfigurement, may be necessary.\nPrognosis\nElectric shocks cause death in 3–15% of cases. Many\nsurvivors require amputation or are disfigured by theirburns. Injuries from household appliances and other low-voltage sources are less likely to produce extreme damage.KEY TERMS\nAntibiotics —Substances used against microorgan-\nisms that cause infection.\nCataract —Clouding of the lens of the eye or its\ncapsule (surrounding membrane).\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan) —A\nprocess that uses x rays to create three-dimension-al images of structures inside the body.\nElectrolytes —Substances that conduct electric\ncurrent within the body and are essential for sus-taining life.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) —The use of\nelectromagnetic energy to create images of struc-tures inside the body.\nSkin grafting —A technique in which a piece of\nhealthy skin from the patient’s body (or a donor’s)is used to cover another part of the patient’s bodythat has lost its skin.Prevention\nParents and other adults need to be alert to possible\nelectric dangers in the home. Damaged electric appliances,wiring, cords, and plugs should be repaired or replaced.Electrical repairs should be attempted only by people withthe proper training. Hair dryers, radios, and other electricappliances should never be used in the bathroom or any-where else they might accidentally come in contact withwater. Young children need to be kept away from electricappliances and should be taught about the dangers of elec-tricity as soon as they are old enough. Electric outletsrequire safety covers in homes with young children.\nDuring thunderstorms, people should go indoors\nimmediately, even if no rain is falling, and boaters shouldreturn to shore as rapidly as possible. People who cannotreach indoor shelter should move away from metallicobjects such as golf clubs and fishing rods and lie down inlow-ground areas. Standing or lying under or next to tall ormetallic structures is unsafe. An automobile is appropriatecover, as long as the radio is off. Telephones, computers,hair dryers, and other appliances that can act as conduitsfor lightning should not be used during thunderstorms.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDimick, Alan R. “Electrical Injuries.” In Harrison’s Principles\nof Internal Medicine , ed.

    "content": "Electrical nerve stimulation\nDefinition\nElectrical nerve stimulation, also called transcuta-\nneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), is a noninva-sive, drug-free pain management technique. By sending\nelectrical signals to underlying nerves, the battery-pow-ered TENS device can relieve a wide range of chronicand acute pain .\nPurpose\nTENS is used to relieve pain caused by a variety of\nchronic conditions, including:\n• neck and lower back pain\n• headache/migraine• arthritis• post-herpetic neuralgia (lingering chronic pain after an\nattack of shingles )\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1144Electrical nerve stimulationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1144• sciatica (pain radiating from lower back, through the\nlegs, to the foot)\n• temporomandibular joint pain• osteoarthritis• amputation (phantom limb)• fibromyalgia (a condition causing aching and stiffness\nthroughout the body)\nThe device is also effective against short-term pain,\nsuch as:\n• shingles (painful skin eruptions along the nerves)\n• bursitis (inflammation of tissue surrounding a joint)• childbirth\n• post-surgical pain\n• fractures• muscle and joint pain• sports injuries• menstrual cramps\nPrecautions\nBecause TENS may interfere with pacemaker func-\ntion, patients with pacemakers should consult a cardiol-\nogist before using a TENS unit. Patients should alsoavoid electrical stimulation in the front of the neck,which can be hazardous. The safety of the device duringpregnancy has not been established.\nTENS doesn’t cure any condition; it simply eases\npain. Patients who are not sure what is causing their painshould consult a physician before using TENS.\nDescription\nThe TENS device is a small battery-powered stimu-\nlator that produces low-intensity electrical signals throughelectrodes on or near a painful area, producing a tinglingsensation that reduces pain. There is no dosage limitation,and the patient controls the amount of pain relief.\nSome experts believe TENS works by blocking pain\nsignals in the spinal cord, or by delivering electricalimpulses to underlying nerve fibers that lessen the expe-rience of pain. Others suspect that the electrical stimula-tion triggers the release of natural painkillers in the body.\nPatients can rent a TENS unit before buying one, to\nsee if it is effective against their pain.\nPreparation\nAfter TENS has been prescribed, a doctor will refer\nthe patient to a TENS specialist, who will explain how touse the machine.

    "title": "Electrocardiography",
    "content": "Electrocardiography\nDefinition\nElectrocardiography is a commonly used, non-inva-\nsive procedure for recording electrical changes in theheart. The record, which is called an electrocardiogram(ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate tothe electrical impulses which occur during each beat ofthe heart. The results are printed on paper or displayedon a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P,Q, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num-ber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present.\nPurpose\nElectrocardiography is a starting point for detecting\nmany cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physicalexaminations and for monitoring the patient’s conditionduring and after surgery, as well as during intensive care.It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise\ntolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms suchas chest pain,shortness of breath , and palpitations .Precautions\nNo special precautions are required.\nDescription\nThe patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec-\ntrodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif-ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, theelectrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may beemployed.\nMuscle movement may interfere with the recording,\nwhich lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases whererhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, thepatient may wear a small Holter monitor in order torecord continuously over a 24-hour period; this is knownas ambulatory monitoring.\nPreparation\nThe skin is cleaned to obtain good electrical contact\nat the electrode positions.\nAftercare\nTo avoid skin irritation from the salty gel used to\nobtain good electrical contact, the skin should be thor-oughly cleaned after removal of the electrodes.\nRisks\nNo complications from this procedure have been\nobserved.\nNormal results\nWhen the heart is operating normally, each part con-\ntracts in a specific order.

These electrical\nimpulses travel through specialized cells that form a con-duction system. Following this pathway ensures that con-tractions will occur in a coordinated manner.\nWhen the presence of all waves is observed in the\nelectrocardiogram and these waves follow the orderdefined alphabetically, the heart is said to show a normalsinus rhythm, and impulses may be assumed to be fol-lowing the regular conduction pathway.\nThe heart is described as showing arrhythmia or dys-\nrhythmia when time intervals between waves, the order,or the number of waves do not fit this pattern. Other fea-tures that may be altered include the direction of wavedeflection and wave widths.\nIn the normal heart, electrical impulses—at a rate of\n60–100 times per minute—originate in the sinus node.The sinus node is located in the first chamber, known asthe right atrium, where blood re-enters the heart. Aftertraveling down to the junction between the upper andlower chambers, the signal stimulates the atrioventricularnode. From here, after a delay, it passes by specializedroutes through the lower chambers or ventricles. In manydisease states, the passage of the electrical impulse canbe interrupted in a variety of ways, causing the heart toperform less efficiently.\nAbnormal results\nSpecial training is required for interpretation of the\nelectrocardiogram. To summarize the features used in inter-pretations in the simplest manner, the P wave of the electro-cardiogram is associated with the contraction of the atria.The QRS series of waves, or QRS complex, is associatedwith ventricular contraction, with the T wave coming afterthe contraction. Finally, the P-Q or P-R interval gives avalue for the time taken for the electrical impulse to travelfrom the atria to the ventricle (normally less than 0.2 sec).The cause of dysrhythmia is ectopic beats. Ectopic\nbeats are premature heart beats that arise from a siteother than the sinus node—commonly from the atria,atrioventricular node, or the ventricle. When these dys-rhythmias are only occasional, they may produce nosymptoms, or a feeling of the heart turning over or “flip-flopping” may be experienced. These occasional dys-rhythmias are common in healthy people, but they alsocan be an indication of heart disease.\nThe varied sources of dysrhythmias provide a wide\nrange of alterations in the form of the electrocardiogram.Ectopic beats that start in the ventricle display an abnor-mal QRS complex. This can indicate disease associatedwith insufficient blood supply to the muscle (myocardialischemia ). Multiple ectopic sites lead to rapid and unco-\nordinated contractions of the atria or ventricles. This con-dition is known as fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, Pwaves are absent, and the QRS complex appears at errat-ic intervals, or “irregularly irregular.”\nWhen the atrial impulse fails to reach the ventricle, a\ncondition known as heart block results. If this is partial,\nthe P-R interval (the time for the impulse to reach the ven-tricle) is prolonged. If complete, the ventricles beat inde-pendently of the atria at about 40 beats per minute, andthe QRS complex is mostly dissociated from the P wave.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAtwood, Sandra, et al.

    "title": "Electroconvulsive therapy",
    "content": "Electroconvulsive therapy\nDefinition\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat-\nment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefullycontrolled amount of electricity is introduced into thebrain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction withanesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces amild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treata variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in thetreatment of severe depression, and provides the mostrapid relief currently available for this illness.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide\nrelief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnessessuch as severe depression, mania , and schizophrenia .\nECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvementbecause they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat ordrink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, orpresent some other danger to themselves. Antidepressantmedications, while effective in many cases, may take twoto six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychoticmedications used to treat mania and schizophrenia havemany uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous sideeffects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel-op allergies and therefore are unable to take their medicine.\nPrecautions\nThe most common risks associated with ECT are\ndisturbances in heart rhythm. Broken or dislocated bonesoccur very rarely.Description\nThe treatment of severe mental illness, such as\nschizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy wasintroduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerlettiand Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con-vulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since,according to their obervations, this disease rarelyoccurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. Theyconcluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi-cally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illnesscould be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari-ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of theirpatients died or suffered severe injuries because thestrength of the convulsions could not be well controlled.\nElectroconvulsive therapy is among the most contro-\nversial of all procedures used to treat mental illness.When it was first introduced, many people were fright-ened simply because it was called “shock treatment.”Many assumed the procedure would be painful, othersthought it was a form of electrocution, and still othersbelieved it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately,unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, andmovies added to these fears.\nIndeed, in those early years, patients and families\nwere rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding thisor other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, noanesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result,\npatients had violent seizures, and even though they didnot remember them, the procedure itself was frightening.\nThe way these treatments are given today is very dif-\nferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently,ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis.Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen,suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR ) in\norder to deal with the rare emergency.\nThe treatment is carried out as follows: approxi-\nmately 30 minutes before the scheduled treatment time,the patient may receive an injection of a medication(such as atropine) that keeps the pulse rate from decreas-ing too much during the convulsion. Next, the patient isplaced on a cot and hooked up to a machine that automat-ically takes and displays vital signs (temperature, pulse,respiration, and blood pressure) on a television-like mon-itor. A mild anesthetic is then injected into a vein, fol-lowed by a medication (such a Anectine) that relaxes allof the muscles in the body so that the seizure is mild, andthe risk of broken bones is virtually eliminated.\nWhen the patient is both relaxed and asleep, an air-\nway is placed in the mouth to aid with breathing. Elec-trodes are placed on the sides of the head in the templeareas. An electric current is passed through the brain bymeans of a machine specifically designed for this pur-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1149Electroconvulsive therapyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1149KEY TERMS\nMania —A mood disorder in which a person expe-\nriences prolonged elation or irritability character-ized by overactivity that can lead to exhaustionand medical emergencies.\nRelapse —A return of the signs and symptoms of\nan illness.\nSchizophrenia —A severe mental illness in which\na person has difficulty distinguishing what is realfrom what is not real. It is often characterized byhallucinations, delusions, and withdrawal frompeople and social activities.pose. The usual dose of electricity is 70–150 volts for\n0.1–0.5 seconds. In the first stage of the seizure (tonicphase), the muscles in the body that have not been para-lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonicphase) that is characterized by twitching movements,usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed armor leg. These are caused by alternating contraction andrelaxation of these same muscles. This stage lastsapproximately 10–60 seconds. The entire procedure,from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes.\nThe total number of treatments a patient will receive\ndepends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, thehistory of illness, family support, and response to thera-py. Patients with depression, for example, usually requiresix to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administeredevery other day, three times a week.\nThe electrodes may be placed on both sides of the\nhead (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateralECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateralECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro-longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment.Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, thenchange to bilateral if the patient is not improving.\nPost-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com-\nmon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT.Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive byproviding patients with factual information about recov-ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas-ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue.These symptoms usually subside with time, but a smallminority of patients state that they have never fullyrecovered from these effects.\nWith the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the\nuse of ECT became less frequent. These new medicationsprovided relief for untold thousands of patients who sufferedgreatly from their illness. However, there are a number ofside effects associated with these drugs, some of which areirreversible. Another drawback is that some medications donot produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. Duringthis time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth-ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond tomedicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For theseindividuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help.\nPreparation\nPatients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being\nshown video tapes that explain both the procedure and therisks involved. The physician then answers any questionsthese individuals may have, and the patient is asked tosign an “Informed Consent Form.” This gives the doctorand the hospital permission to administer the treatment.Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com-\nplete physical examination , and orders a number of\ntests that can help identify any potential problem. Thesetests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram\n(ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and\ncomplete blood count (CBC).\nSome medications, such as lithium and a type of anti-\ndepressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors ,\nshould be discontinued for some time before treatment.Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eighthours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi-bility of vomiting and choking .\nAftercare\nAfter the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery\narea. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until thepatient is fully awake, which may take 15–30 minutes.Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap-pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints ofheadache , muscle pain , or back pain. Such discomfort is\nquickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin .\nRisks\nAdvanced medical technology has substantially\nreduced the complications associated with ECT. Theseinclude slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat(tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons athigh risk for ECT include those with recent heart\nattack , uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and\nprevious spinal injuries.\nNormal results\nECT often produces dramatic improvement in the\nsigns and symptoms of major depression, especially in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1150Electroconvulsive therapyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1150elderly individuals, sometimes during the first week of\ntreatment. While it is estimated that 50% of thesepatients will experience a future return of symptoms, theprognosis for each episode of illness is good. Mania alsooften responds well to treatment. The picture is not asbright for schizophrenia, which is more difficult to treatand is characterized by frequent relapses.\nA few patients are placed on maintenance ECT. This\nmeans they return to the hospital every one to twomonths, as needed, for an additional treatment. Theseindividuals are thus able to keep their illness under con-trol and lead a normal and productive life.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAntai-Otong, Deborah.

    "content": "Electroencephalography\nDefinition\nElectroencephalography, or EEG, is a neurological\ntest that uses an electronic monitoring device to measureand record electrical activity in the brain.\nPurpose\nThe EEG is a key tool in the diagnosis and manage-\nment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It is also usedto assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g.,stroke , tumors, encephalitis ),mental retardation ,sleep\ndisorders , degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s dis-\nease and Parkinson’s disease , and certain mental disor-\nders (e.g., alcoholism ,schizophrenia ,autism ).An EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity\nduring surgery and to determine brain death .\nPrecautions\nElectroencephalography should be administered and\ninterpreted by a trained medical professional only. Datafrom an EEG is only one element of a complete medicaland/or psychological patient assessment, and shouldnever be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis.\nDescription\nBefore the EEG begins, a nurse or technician attach-\nes approximately 16–20 electrodes to the patient’s scalpwith a conductive, washable paste. Depending on thepurpose for the EEG, implantable or invasive electrodesare occasionally used. Implantable electrodes includesphenoidal electrodes, which are fine wires insertedunder the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone; and depth elec-trodes, which are surgically-implanted into the brain.The EEG electrodes are painless, and are used to mea-sure the electrical activity in various regions of the brain.\nFor the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table,\nor comfortable chair and is asked to relax and remain stillduring the EEG testing period. An EEG usually takes nomore than one hour. During the test procedure, thepatient may be asked to breathe slowly or quickly; visualstimuli such as flashing lights or a patterned board maybe used to stimulate certain types of brain activity.Throughout the procedure, the electroencephalographmachine makes a continuous graphic record of thepatient’s brain activity, or brainwaves, on a long strip ofrecording paper or on a computer screen. This graphicrecord is called an electroencephalogram.\nThe sleep EEG uses the same equipment and proce-\ndures as a regular EEG. Patients undergoing a sleep EEGare encouraged to fall asleep completely rather than justrelax. They are typically provided a bed and a quiet roomconducive to sleep. A sleep EEG lasts up to three hours.\nIn an ambulatory EEG, patients are hooked up to a\nportable cassette recorder. They then go about their nor-mal activities, and take their normal rest and sleep for aperiod of up to 24 hours. During this period, the patientand patient’s family record any symptoms or abnormalbehaviors, which can later be correlated with the EEG tosee if they represent seizures.\nMany insurance plans provide reimbursement for\nEEG testing. Costs for an EEG range from $100 to morethan $500, depending on the purpose and type of test(i.e., asleep or awake, and invasive or non-invasive elec-trodes). Because coverage may be dependent on the dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1151ElectroencephalographyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1151order or illness the EEG is evaluating, patients should\ncheck with their individual insurance plan.\nPreparation\nFull instructions should be given to EEG patients\nwhen they schedule their test. Typically, individuals onmedications that affect the central nervous system, suchas anticonvulsants, stimulants, or antidepressants, aretold to discontinue their prescription for a short timeprior to the test (usually one to two days). Patients maybe asked to avoid food and beverages that contain caf-\nfeine , a central nervous system stimulant. However, any\nsuch request should be cleared by the treating physician.Patients may also be asked to arrive for the test withclean hair free of spray or other styling products.\nPatients undergoing a sleep EEG may be asked to\nremain awake the night before their test. They may begiven a sedative prior to the test to induce sleep.\nAftercare\nIf the patient has suspended regular medication for\nthe test, the EEG nurse or technician should advise himwhen he can begin taking it again.Risks\nBeing off medication for one to two days may trigger\nseizures. Certain procedures used during EEG may trig-ger seizures in patients with epilepsy. Those proceduresinclude flashing lights and deep breathing. If the EEG isbeing used as a diagnostic for epilepsy (i.e., to determinethe type of seizures an individual is suffering from), thismay be a desired effect, although the patient needs to bemonitored closely so that the seizure can be aborted ifnecessary. This type of test is known as an ictal EEG.\nNormal results\nIn reading and interpreting brainwave patterns, a\nneurologist or other physician will evaluate the type ofbrainwaves and the symmetry, location, and consistencyof brainwave patterns. He will also look at the brain-wave response to certain stimuli presented during theEEG test (such as flashing lights or noise). There arefour basic types of brainwaves: alpha, beta, theta, anddelta. “Normal” brainwave patterns vary widely,depending on factors of age and activity. For example,awake and relaxed individuals typically register an alphawave pattern of eight to 13 cycles per second.

Electrolytes with a positive chargeinclude sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; thenegative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate.The concentrations of these ions in the bloodstreamremain fairly constant throughout the day in a healthyperson. Changes in the concentration of one or more ofthese ions can occur during various acute and chronicdisease states and can lead to serious consequences.\nPurpose\nTests that measure the concentration of electrolytes\nare useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues forthe diagnosis of specific diseases. Electrolyte tests areused for diagnosing dietary deficiencies, excess loss ofnutrients due to urination, vomiting, and diarrhea ,o r\nabnormal shifts in the location of an electrolyte withinthe body. When an abnormal electrolyte value is detect-ed, the physician may either act to immediately correctthe imbalance directly (in the case of an emergency) orrun further tests to determine the underlying cause of theabnormal electrolyte value. Electrolyte disturbances canoccur with malfunctioning of the kidney (renal failure),infections that produce severe and continual diarrhea orvomiting, drugs that cause loss of electrolytes in theurine ( diuretics ),poisoning due to accidental consump-\ntion of electrolytes, or diseases involving hormones thatregulate electrolyte concentrations.\nPrecautions\nElectrolyte tests are performed from routine blood\ntests. The techniques are simple, automated, and fairlyuniform throughout the United States. During the prepa-ration of blood plasma or serum, health workers musttake care not to break the red blood cells, especiallywhen testing for serum potassium. Because the concen-tration of potassium within red blood cells is much high-er than in the surrounding plasma or serum, broken cellswould cause falsely elevated potassium levels.\nDescription\nElectrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood\nplasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids. Electrolytescan be classified in at least five different ways. One wayis that some electrolytes tend to exist mostly inside cells,or are intracellular, while others tend to be outside cells,or are extracellular. Potassium, phosphate, and magne-sium occur at much greater levels inside the cell thanoutside, while sodium and chloride occur at much greaterlevels extracellularly. A second classification distinguish-es those electrolytes that participate directly in the trans-mission of nerve impulses and those that do not. Sodium,potassium, and calcium are the important electrolytesinvolved in nerve impulses, and disorders affecting themare most closely associated with neurological disorders.A third classification focuses on electrolytes that are ableto form a tight union, or complex, with one another. Cal-cium and phosphate have the greatest tendency to formcomplexes with each other. Disorders that cause anincrease in either plasma calcium or phosphate can resultin the deposit of calcium-phosphate crystals in the softtissues of the body. A fourth classification concerns thoseelectrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of thebloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the blood-stream is normally in the range of 7.35–7.45. A decreasebelow this range is called acidosis, while a pH above thisrange is called alkalosis. The electrolytes most closelyassociated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbon-ate, chloride, and phosphate.\nPreparation\nAll electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma or\nserum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood sam-ple and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical thatprevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum isprepared by withdrawing a blood sample, placing it in atest tube, and allowing it to clot. The blood spontaneouslyclots within a minute of withdrawing the blood from avein. The serum or plasma is then rapidly spun with acentrifuge in order to remove the blood cells or clot.\nNormal results\nElectrolyte concentrations are similar whether mea-\nsured in serum or plasma. Values can be expressed interms of weight per unit volume (mg/deciliter; mg/dL) orin the number of molecules in a volume, or molarity(moles or millimoles/liter; M or mM). The range of nor-mal values sometimes varies slightly between differentage groups, for males and females, and between differentanalytical laboratories.\nThe normal level of serum sodium is in the range of\n136–145 mM. The normal levels of serum potassium are3.5–5.0 mM. Note that sodium occurs at a much higherconcentration than potassium. The normal concentrationof total serum calcium (bound calcium plus free calcium)is in the range of 8.8–10.4 mg/dL. About 40% of the totalcalcium in the plasma is loosely bound to proteins; this\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1157Electrolyte testsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1157calcium is referred to as bound calcium. The normal range\nof free calcium is 4.8–5.2 mg/dL. The normal concentra-tion of serum magnesium is in the range of 2.0–3.0 mg/dL.\nThe normal concentration range of chloride is\n350–375 mg/dL or 98–106 mM. The normal level ofphosphate, as expressed as the concentration of phospho-rus, is 2.0–4.3 mg/dL. Bicarbonate is an electrolyte thatis freely and spontaneously interconvertable with carbon-ic acid and carbon dioxide. The normal concentration ofcarbonic acid (H\n2CO3) is about 1.35 mM. The normal\nconcentration of bicarbonate (HCO3/H11002) is about 27 mM.\nThe concentration of total carbon dioxide is the sum ofcarbonic acid and bicarbonate; this sum is normally inthe range of 26–28 mM. The ratio of bicarbonate/carbon-ic acid is more significant than the actual concentrationsof these two forms of carbon dioxide. Its normal value is27/1.35 (equivalent to 20/1).\nAbnormal results\nPositively charged electrolytes\nHigh serum sodium levels ( hypernatremia ) occur at\nsodium concentrations over 145 mM, with severe hyper-natremia over 152 mM. Hypernatremia is usually causedby diseases that cause excessive urination. In these cases,water is lost, but sodium is still retained in the body. Thesymptoms include confusion and can lead to convulsionsand coma . Low serum sodium levels ( hyponatremia ) are\nbelow 130 mM, with severe hyponatremia at or below 125mM. Hyponatremia often occurs with severe diarrhea,with losses of both water and sodium, but with sodiumloss exceeding water loss. Hyponatremia provokes clinicalproblems only if serum sodium falls below 125 mM, espe-cially if this has occurred rapidly. The symptoms can be asmild as tiredness but may lead to convulsions and coma.\nHigh serum potassium ( hyperkalemia ) occurs at\npotassium levels above 5.0 mM; it is considered severeover 8.0 mM. Hyperkalemia is relatively uncommon, butsometimes occurs in patients with kidney failure who takepotassium supplements. Hyperkalemia can result in abnor-mal beating of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias ). Low\nserum potassium ( hypokalemia ) occurs when serum\npotassium falls below 3.0 mM. It can result from lowdietary potassium, as during starvation or in patients with\nanorexia nervosa ; from excessive losses via the kidneys,\nas caused by diuretic drugs; or by diseases of the adrenalor pituitary glands. Mild hypokalemia causes muscleweakness, while severe hypokalemia can cause paralysis ,\nthe inability to breathe, and cardiac arrhythmias.\nHigh levels of calcium ions ( hypercalcemia ) occur\nat free calcium ion concentrations over 5.2 mg/dL ortotal serum calcium above 10.4 mg/dL. Hypercalcemiausually occurs when the body dissolves bone at an abnor-\nmally fast rate, increasing both serum calcium and serumphosphate. Sudden hypercalcemia can cause vomitingand coma, while prolonged and moderate hypercalcemiaresults in the deposit of calcium phosphate crystals in thekidneys and eye. Hypocalcemia occurs when serum free\ncalcium ions fall below 4.4 mg/dL, or when total serumcalcium falls below 8.8 mg/dL. Hypocalcemia can resultfrom hypoparathyroidism (low parathyroid hormone),\nfrom failure to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, fromlow levels of plasma magnesium, and from phosphatepoisoning (the phosphate enters the bloodstream andforms a complex with the free serum calcium). Hypocal-cemia can cause depression and muscle spasms.\nHypermagnesemia occurs at serum magnesium lev-\nels over 25 mM (60 mg/dL). Hypermagnesemia is rarebut can occur with the excessive consumption of magne-sium salts. Hypomagnesemia occurs when serum magne-sium levels fall below 0.8 mM, and can result from poornutrition . Chronic alcoholism is the most common\ncause of hypomagnesemia, in part because of poor diet.Magnesium levels below 0.5 mM (1.2 mg/dL) causeserum calcium levels to decline. Some of the symptomsof hypomagnesemia, including twitching and convul-sions, actually result from the concurrent hypocalcemia.Hypomagnesemia can also result in hypokalemia andthereby cause cardiac arrhythmias.\nNegatively charged electrolytes\nSerum chloride levels sometimes increase to abnor-\nmal levels as an undesirable side effect of medical treat-ment with sodium chloride or ammonium chloride. Thetoxicity of chloride results not from the chloride itself, butfrom the fact that the chloride occurs as the acid, hydro-gen chloride (more commonly known as hydrochloricacid, or HCl). An overdose of chloride may cause theaccumulation of hydrochloric acid in the bloodstream,with consequent acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis , one of\nmany kidney diseases, involves the failure to release acidinto the urine. The acidosis produces weakness,headache , nausea, and cardiac arrest. Low plasma chlo-\nride leads to the opposite situation: a decline in the acidcontent of the bloodstream. This is known as alkalizationof the bloodstream, or alkalosis. Hydrochloric acid, origi-nally from extracellular fluids, can be lost by vomiting. Atits most severe, alkalosis results in paralysis (tetany).\nHyperphosphatemia occurs at serum phosphate levels\nabove 5 mg/dL. It can result from the failure of the kidneysto excrete phosphate into the urine, causing phosphate toaccumulate in the bloodstream. Hyperphosphatemia canalso be caused by the impaired action of parathyroid hor-mone and by phosphate poisoning. Severe hyperphos-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1158Electrolyte testsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1158phatemia can cause paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac\narrest. These symptoms result because the phosphate,occurring in elevated levels, complexes with free serumcalcium, resulting in hypocalcemia. Tests for heart func-tion (an electrocardiogram) and parathyroid hormone lev-els are used in the diagnosis of hyperphosphatemia.Hypophosphatemia occurs if serum phosphorus falls to2.0 mg/dL or lower. It often results from a shift of inorgan-ic phosphate from the bloodstream to various organs andtissues. This shift can be caused by a rise in pH (alkaliza-tion) of the bloodstream, which can occur during hyper-ventilation, a reaction in various disease states. A shift inphosphate to intracellular tissues may draw calcium awayfrom the bloodstream via the formation of insoluble calci-um phosphate crystals within cells, with consequenthypocalcemia. Thus, tests for abnormalities in phosphatemetabolism also involve tests for serum calcium.\nBicarbonate metabolism involves several com-\npounds. When dietary starches, sugars, and fats are bro-ken down for energy production, carbon dioxide is creat-ed. Much of this carbon dioxide (CO\n2) spontaneously\nconverts to carbonic acid (H2CO3), and some of the car-\nbonic acid spontaneously converts to bicarbonate(HCO\n3/H11002) plus a hydrogen ion (H+). Eventually, almost\nevery molecule of carbon dioxide produced in the body,whether in the form of carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, orbicarbonate, must convert back to carbon dioxide inorder to leave via the lungs during normal breathing.\nIf one holds one’s breath, carbon dioxide cannot\nescape from the lungs, but continues to be generated with-in the body. This results in an increase in production ofcarbonic acid. A portion of the carbonic acid breaks apart(dissociates), causing an increase in hydrogen ions in theplasma, with a resulting acidosis. Tests for serum bicar-bonate levels are accompanied by tests for acidosis (pHtest). Conversely, when one breathes too rapidly (hyper-ventilation), the carbon dioxide is drawn off from thebloodstream and expelled in the breath at an increasedrate. This results in an increase in the rate of combinationof bicarbonate with hydrogen ions, resulting in alkalosis.Acidosis and alkalosis can be produced by means otherthan by altering the rate of breathing. The carbonic acidand bicarbonate in the bloodstream minimize (or buffer)any trend to acidosis or alkalosis. Tests for bicarbonateare generally accompanied by tests for blood pH and pos-sibly tests for kidney malfunction, abnormal hormonefunction, or gastrointestinal disorders.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

    "content": "Electromyography\nDefinition\nElectromyography (EMG) is an electrical recording\nof muscle activity that aids in the diagnosis of neuromus-cular disease.\nPurpose\nMuscles are stimulated by signals from nerve cells\ncalled motor neurons. This stimulation causes electricalactivity in the muscle, which in turn causes contraction.This electrical activity is detected by a needle electrodeinserted into the muscle and connected to a recordingdevice. Together, the electrode and recorder are called anelectromyography machine. EMG can determine whethera particular muscle is responding appropriately to stimu-lation, and whether a muscle remains inactive when notstimulated.\nEMG is performed most often to help diagnose dif-\nferent diseases causing weakness. Although EMG is atest of the motor system, it may help identify abnormali-ties of nerves or spinal nerve roots that may be associatedwith pain or numbness. Other symptoms for which EMG\nmay be useful include numbness, atrophy, stiffness, fas-ciculation, cramp, deformity, and spasticity.

If a mus-cle biopsy is planned as part of the diagnostic work-up,EMG should not be performed at the same site, as it mayeffect the microscopic appearance of the muscle.\nDescription\nDuring an EMG test, a fine needle is inserted into\nthe muscle to be tested. This may cause some discomfort,similar to that of an injection. Recordings are made whilethe muscle is at rest, and then during the contraction. Theperson performing the test may move the limb being test-ed, and direct the patient to move it with various levels offorce. The needle may be repositioned in the same mus-cle for further recording. Other muscles may be tested aswell. A typical session lasts from 30–60 minutes.\nA slightly different test, the nerve conduction veloci-\nty test , is often performed at the same time with the same\nequipment. In this test, stimulating and recording elec-trodes are used, and small electrical shocks are applied tomeasure the ability of the nerve to conduct electrical sig-nals.

    "title": "Electronic fetal monitoring",
    "content": "Electronic fetal monitoring\nDefinition\nElectronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a method for\nexamining the condition of a baby in the uterus by notingany unusual changes in its heart rate. Electronic fetal moni-toring is performed late in pregnancy or continuously dur-\ning labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFMcan be utilized either externally or internally in the womb.\nPurpose\nThe heart rate of a fetus undergoes constant adjust-\nment as it responds to its environment and other stimuli.The fetal monitor records an unborn baby’s heart rate andgraphs it on a piece of paper. Electronic fetal monitoringis usually advised for high-risk pregnancies, when thebaby is in danger of distress. Specific reasons for EFMinclude: babies in a breech position, premature labor ,\nand induced labor, among others.\nWhen electronic fetal monitoring was originally\nintroduced in the 1960s and 1970s, the hope was that itwould help physicians diagnose fetal hypoxia, or lack ofoxygen, in time to prevent damage to the baby. This lackof oxygen, also known as perinatal asphyxia or birthasphyxia, is an important cause of stillbirth and newborn\ndeaths. It occurs when there are less than normalamounts of oxygen delivered to the body or an organ andthere is build-up of carbon dioxide in the body or tissue.A lack of blood flow to an organ can cause asphyxia.Perinatal asphyxia can occur a long time before birth,shortly before birth, during delivery, or after birth. If theinterruption to the supply of oxygen is short, the babymay recover without any damage. If the time is longer,there may be some injury that is reversible. If the timeperiod without oxygen is very long, there may be perma-nent injury to one or more organs of the body. It is impor-tant, to detect any signs of asphyxia as soon as possible.One of the signs is an abnormal heart rate and rhythm inthe unborn baby, which can be detected by electronicfetal monitoring.\nThe fetal monitor is a more intricate version of the\nmachine that a health care provider uses to listen to a baby’sheartbeat. The monitor that is used during prenatal visits justpicks up the sound of the baby’s heart beating. The fetalmonitor also keeps a continuous paper record of the heartrate. In addition, the fetal monitor can record uterine con-tractions on the lower part of the paper strip. This helps thedoctor or midwife determine how a baby is handling thestress of contractions. The normal pattern is for the baby’s\nheartbeat to drop slightly during a contraction and then goback to normal after the contraction is over. EFM looks forany changes from this normal pattern, particularly if there isa drastic drop in the baby’s heart beat or if the heart ratedoes not recover immediately after a contraction.\nBecause it is an indirect test, it is not perfect. When\nan adult complains to a provider about not feeling well,checking the heart rate is only one of many things thatthe doctor will do. With an unborn baby, however, check-ing the heart rate is basically the only thing that a doctoror midwife can do.\nFetal monitoring can be helpful in a variety of differ-\nent situations. During pregnancy, fetal monitoring can beused as a part of antepartum testing . If the practitioner\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1161Electronic fetal monitoring\nPubic boneUmbilical cord\nIntrauterine\npressure catheter\nVagina\nElectronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is performed late in preg-\nnancy or continuously during labor to ensure normal deliv-ery of a healthy baby. EFM can be utilized either externallyor internally in the womb.The illustration above shows theinternal procedure, in which an electrode is attached direct-ly to the baby’s scalp to monitor the heart rate. Uterine con-tractions are recorded using an intrauterine pressurecatheter which is inserted through the cervix into theuterus.

Inthis test, changes in the baby’s heart rate are measuredalong with the fetus’ own movements. The heart rate of ahealthy baby should go up whenever she or he moves.\nFetal monitoring is used on and off during early\nlabor. As labor progresses, more monitoring is oftenneeded. Usually, as the time for delivery nears, the moni-tor is left on continuously since the end of labor tends tobe the most stressful time for the baby.\nA baby who is having trouble in labor will show char-\nacteristic changes in heart rate after a contraction (latedecelerations). If a baby is not receiving enough oxygen towithstand the stress of labor and delivery is many hoursaway, a cesarean section (C-section) may be necessary.\nDescription\nUsing the external fetal monitor is simple and painless.\nTwo elastic belts are placed around the mother’s abdomen.One belt holds a listening device in place while the otherbelt holds the contraction monitor. The nurse or midwifeadjusts the belts to get the best readings from each device.\nSometimes, it is difficult to hear the baby’s heartbeat\nwith the external monitoring device. Other times, themonitor may show subtle signs of a developing problem.In either case, the doctor or midwife may recommend thatthe external belt be replaced with an internal monitor.\nThe internal monitor is an electronic wire that rests\ndirectly on the baby’s head. The provider can place it onthe baby’s head during an internal exam. The internalmonitor can only be used when the cervix is alreadyopen. This device provides a more accurate record of thebaby’s heart rate.\nPreparation\nThere are no special preparations needed for fetal\nmonitoring.KEY TERMS\nBreech presentation —Fetal position in which the\nbuttocks come first.\nA cesarean section —delivery of a baby through an\nincision in the mother’s abdomen instead ofthrough the vagina.\nHypoxia —An oxygen deficiency.Risks\nExternal EFM poses no direct risks to the baby. How-\never, because of being connected to the machine, themother cannot walk around. This inactivity may prolonglabor and reduce oxygen levels in the mother’s blood, bothof which can be detrimental to the unborn baby. Anotherproblem is that electronic fetal monitoring seems to beassociated with an increase in caesarian deliveries. Thereis a concern that EFM can give false alarms of distress inthe baby, and that this can lead to unneeded caesarians.With internal monitoring, there is a higher risk for infec-tion. For these and other reasons, the United States Pre-ventive Services Task Force states that there is some evi-dence that using electronic fetal monitoring on low-riskwomen in labor might not be indicated. Many physicians,however, continue to use EFM routinely, and believe it tobe of value in both low-risk and high-risk labors.\nNormal results\nAn unborn baby’s heart rate normally ranges from\n120–160 beats per minute (bpm). A baby who is receiv-ing enough oxygen through the placenta will movearound. The monitor strip will show the baby’s heart raterising briefly as he/she moves (just as an adult’s heartrate rises when he/she moves).\nThe baby’s monitor strip is considered to be reactive\nwhen the baby’s heart rate rises at least 20 bpm above thebaseline heart rate for at least 20 seconds. This mustoccur at least twice in a 20-minute period. A reactiveheart rate tracing (also known as a reactive non-stresstest) is considered a sign of the baby’s well being.\nAbnormal results\nIf the baby’s heart rate drops very low or rises very\nhigh, this signals a serious problem. In either of thesecases it is obvious that the baby is in distress and must bedelivered soon. However, many babies who are havingproblems do not give such clear signs.\nDuring a contraction, the flow of oxygen (from the\nmother) through the placenta (to the baby) is temporarilystopped. It is as if the baby has to hold its breath duringeach contraction. Both the placenta and the baby aredesigned to withstand this condition. Between contrac-tions, the baby should be receiving more than enoughoxygen to do well during the contraction.\nThe first sign that a baby is not getting enough oxy-\ngen between contractions is often a drop in the baby’sheart rate after the contraction (late deceleration). Thebaby’s heart rate recovers to a normal level between con-tractions, only to drop again after the next contraction.This is also a more subtle sign of distress.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1162Electronic fetal monitoringGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1162These babies will do fine if they are delivered in a\nshort period of time.

Swartout-Corbeil, R.N.\nElectrophysiology study of \nthe heart\nDefinition\nAn electrophysiology (EP) study of the heart is a\nnonsurgical analysis of the electrical conduction system(normal or abnormal) of the heart. The test employs car-diac catheters and sophisticated computers to generateelectrocardiogram (EKG) tracings and electrical mea-surements with exquisite precision from within the heartchambers.\nThe EP study can be performed solely for diagnostic\npurposes. It also is performed to pinpoint the exact loca-tion of electrical signals (cardiac mapping) in conjunctionwith a therapeutic procedure called catheter ablation .\nThe test is simple, not painful, and performed in a\nspecial laboratory under controlled clinical circum-stances by cardiologists and nurses who subspecialize inelectrophysiology.\nPurpose\nA cardiologist may recommend an EP study when\nthe standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress\ntest, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide\nenough information to evaluate an abnormal heartrhythm, called an arrhythmia.\nAn EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a\nsuspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptomsof an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detectedfrom other tests.\nThe purpose and great value of an EP study is that it\noffers more detailed information to the doctor about theelectrical activity in the heart than the aforementionednoninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directlyonheart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to\ndetermine the specific location of an arrhythmia and,oftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. Thiscorrective treatment is permanent and considered a cure,and, in many cases, the patient may not need to take heartmedications.\nEP studies may be helpful in assessing:\n• certain tachycardias or bradycardias of unknown\ncause.\n• patients who have been resuscitated after experiencing\nsudden cardiac death .\n• various symptoms of unknown cause, such as chest\npain ,shortness of breath ,fatigue , or syncope (dizzi-\nness/fainting).\n• response to anti-arrhythmic therapy.\nPrecautions\nPregnant patients should not undergo an EP study\nbecause of exposure to radiation during the study, whichmay be harmful to the growing baby.\nPatients who have coronary artery disease may\nneed to have that treated before having an EP study.\nDescription\nThe rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is\nessentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulsestraveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham-bers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA)node, which are specialized cells situated in the top rightchamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SAnode, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generatesthe impulses, which travel through specific pathwaysthroughout the atria to the atrioventricular (A V) node.The A V node is a relay station, sending the impulses tomore specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottomchambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathwaysbecome damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path-ways exist, the heart’s rhythm may be altered (perhapstoo slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriouslyaffect the heart’s pumping ability.\nThe patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP\nlab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets areplaced over him or her. A minimum of two catheters areinserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groinarea. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the numberof catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heartmay vary. For certain tachycardias, two more cathetersmay be inserted in the left groin and one in the internaljugular (neck) vein or in the subclavian (below the clavi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1163Electrophysiology study of the heartGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:14 PM  Page 1163cle) vein. The catheters are about 0.08 in (2 mm) in\ndiameter, about the size of a spaghetti noodle. Thecatheters used in catheter ablation are slightly larger.\nWith the help of fluoroscopy (x rays on a television\nscreen), all the catheters are guided to several specificlocations in the heart. Typically, four to 10 electrodes arelocated on the end of the catheters, which have the abilityto send electrical signals to stimulate the heart (calledpacing) and to receive electrical signals from the heart—but not at the same time (just as a walkie-talkie cannotsend and receive messages at the same time).\nFirst, the electrodes are positioned to receive signals\nfrom inside the heart chambers. This allows the doctor tomeasure how fast the electrical impulses travel currentlyin the patient’s heart. These measurements are called thepatient’s baseline measurements. Next, the electrodes arepositioned to pace: The EP team actually tries to induce(sometimes in combination with various heart drugs) the\narrhythmia that the patient has previously experienced sothe team can observe it in a controlled environment,compare it to the patient’s clinical or spontaneousarrhythmia, and decide how to treat it.\nOnce the arrhythmia is induced and the team deter-\nmines it can be treated with catheter ablation, cardiacmapping is performed to locate precisely the origin androute of the abnormal pathway. When this is accom-plished, the ablating electrode catheter is positioneddirectly against the abnormal pathway, and high radio-frequency energy is delivered through the electrode todestroy (burn) the tissue in this area.\nPreparation\nThe following preparations are made for an EP\nstudy:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1164Electrophysiology study of the heart\nAn electrophysiologist nurse monitors a patient’s heart rhythm during an electrophysiology study for tachycardia.

    "title": "Elephantiasis",
    "content": "Elephantiasis\nDefinition\nThe word elephantiasis is a vivid and accurate term\nfor the syndrome it describes: the gross (visible) enlarge-ment of the arms, legs, or genitals to elephantoid size.\nDescription\nTrue elephantiasis is the result of a parasitic infec-\ntion caused by three specific kinds of round worms. Thelong, threadlike worms block the body’s lymphatic sys-tem—a network of channels, lymph nodes, and organsthat helps maintain proper fluid levels in the body bydraining lymph from tissues into the bloodstream. Thisblockage causes fluids to collect in the tissues, which canlead to great swelling, called “lymphedema.” Limbs canswell so enormously that they resemble an elephant’sforeleg in size, texture, and color. This is the severely dis-figuring and disabling condition of elephantiasis.\nThere are a few different causes of elephantiasis, but\nthe agents responsible for most of the elephantiasis in theworld are filarial worms: white, slender round wormsfound in most tropical and subtropical places. They aretransmitted by particular kinds (species) of mosquitoes,that is, bloodsucking insects. Infection with these wormsis called “lymphatic filariasis” and over a long period oftime can cause elephantiasis.\nLymphatic filariasis is a disease of underdeveloped\nregions found in South America, Central Africa, Asia, thePacific Islands, and the Caribbean. It is a disease that hasbeen present for centuries, as ancient Persian and Indianwritings clearly described elephant-like swellings of thearms, legs, and genitals. It is estimated that 120 millionpeople in the world have lymphatic filariasis, as of 1997.The disease appears to be spreading, in spite of decadesof research in this area.\nOther terms for elephantiasis are Barbados leg, ele-\nphant leg, morbus herculeus, mal de Cayenne, andmyelolymphangioma.\nOther situations that can lead to elephantiasis are:\n• a protozoan disease called leishmaniasis\n• a repeated streptococcal infection\n• the surgical removal of lymph nodes (usually to prevent\nthe spread of cancer )\n• a hereditary birth defect\nCauses and symptoms\nThree kinds of round worms cause elephantiasis filar-\niasis: Wuchereria bancrofti ,Brugia malayi , and Brugia\ntimori . Of these three, W. bancrofti makes up about 90% of\nthe cases. Man is the only known host of W. bancrofti .\nCulex ,Aedes , and Anopheles mosquitoes are the car-\nriers of W. bancrofti . Anopheles and Mansonia mosqui-\ntoes are the carriers of B. malayi . In addition, Anopheles\nmosquitoes are the carriers of B. timori .\nInfected female mosquitoes take a blood meal from\na human, and, in doing so, introduce larval forms of theparticular parasite they carry to the person. These larvaemigrate toward a lymphatic channel, then travel to vari-ous places within the lymphatic system, usually position-ing themselves in or near lymph nodes throughout thebody. During this time, they mature into more developedlarvae and eventually into adult worms. Depending uponthe species of round worm, this development can take afew months or more than a year. The adult worms growto about 1 in (2.5 cm) to 4 in (10 cm) long.\nThe adult worms can live from about three to eight\nyears. Some have been known to live to 20 years, and inone case 40 years. The adult worms begin reproducingnumerous live embryos, called microfilariae. The micro-filariae travel to the bloodstream, where they can beingested by a mosquito when it takes a blood meal fromthe infected person. If they are not ingested by a mosqui-to, the microfilariae die within about 12 months. If theyare ingested by a mosquito, they continue to mature.They are totally dependent on their specific species ofmosquito to develop further. The cycle continues whenthe mosquito takes another blood meal.\nMost of the symptoms an infected person experi-\nences are due to the blockage of the lymphatic system bythe adult worms and due to the substances (excretionsand secretions) produced by the worms.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1166ElephantiasisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1166The body’s allergic reactions may include repeated\nepisodes of fever , shaking chills, sweating, headaches,\nvomiting, and pain . Enlarged lymph nodes, swelling of\nthe affected area, skin ulcers, bone and joint pain, tired-ness, and red streaks along the arm or leg also may occur.Abscesses can form in lymph nodes or in the lymphaticvessels. They may appear at the surface of the skin as well.\nLong-term infection with lymphatic filariasis can\nlead to lymphedema , hydrocele (a buildup of fluid in any\nsaclike cavity or duct) in the scrotum, and elephantiasis ofthe legs, scrotum, arms, penis, breasts, and vulvae. Themost common site of elephantiasis is the leg. It typicallybegins in the ankle and progresses to the foot and leg. Atfirst the swollen leg may feel soft to the touch but eventu-ally becomes hard and thick. The skin may appear dark-ened or warty and may even crack, allowing bacteria toinfect the leg and complicate the disease. The microfilari-ae usually don’t cause injury. In some instances, theycause “eosinophilia,” an increased number of eosinophils(a type of white blood cells) in the blood.\nThis disease is more intense in people who never\nhave been exposed to lymphatic filariasis than it is in thenative people of tropical areas where the disease occurs.This is because many of the native people often areimmunologically tolerant.\nDiagnosis\nThe only sure way to diagnose lymphatic filariasis is\nby detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms orthe microfilariae.\nMicroscopic examination of the person’s blood may\nreveal microfilariae. But many times, people who havebeen infected for a long time do not have microfilariae intheir bloodstream. The absence of them, therefore, doesnot mean necessarily that the person is not infected. Inthese cases, examining the urine or hydrocele fluid orperforming other clinical tests is necessary.\nCollecting blood from the individual for microscopic\nexamination should be done during the night when themicrofilariae are more numerous in the bloodstream.(Interestingly, this is when mosquitoes bite most frequent-ly.) During the day microfilariae migrate to deeper bloodvessels in the body, especially in the lung. If it is decidedto perform the blood test during the day, the infected indi-vidual may be given a “provocative” dose of medicationto provoke the microfilariae to enter the bloodstream.Blood then can be collected an hour later for examination.\nDetecting the adult worms can be difficult because\nthey are deep within the lymphatic system and difficult toget to. Biopsies usually are not performed because theyusually don’t reveal much information.Treatment\nThe drug of choice in treating lymphatic filariasis is\ndiethylcarbamazine (DEC). The trade name in the UnitedStates is Hetrazan.\nThe treatment schedule is typically 2 mg/kg per day,\nthree times a day, for three weeks. The drug is taken intablet form.\nDEC kills the microfilariae quickly and injures or\nkills the adult worms slowly, if at all. If all the adultworms are not killed, remaining paired males andfemales may continue to produce more larvae. There-fore, several courses of DEC treatment over a longtime period may be necessary to rid the individual ofthe parasites.\nDEC has been shown to reduce the size of enlarged\nlymph nodes and, when taken long-term, to reduce ele-phantiasis. In India, DEC has been given in the form of amedicated salt, which helps prevent spread of the disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1167Elephantiasis\nMan suffering from elephantiasis.

For this reason, DEC mustbe given carefully to reduce the danger to the individual.Side effects may include fever, chills, headache ,dizzi-\nness,nausea and vomiting ,itching , and joint pain.\nThese side effects usually occur within the first few daysof treatment. These side effects usually subside as theindividual continues taking the drug.\nThere is an alternate treatment plan for the use of\nDEC. This plan is designed to kill the parasites slowly (toreduce allergic reactions to the dead microfilariae anddying adult worms within the body). Lower doses of DECare taken for the first few days, followed by the higherdose of 2 mg/kg per day for the remaining three weeks. Inaddition, steroids may be prescribed to prevent the indi-vidual’s body from reacting severely to the dead worms.\nAnother drug used is Ivermectin.

It is probable thatpatients will need to continue using DEC to kill the adultworms. Mild side effects of Ivermectin include headache,fever, and myalgia.\nOther means of managing lymphatic filariasis are\npressure bandages to wrap the swollen limb and elasticstockings to help reduce the pressure. Exercising and ele-vating a bandaged limb also can help reduce its size.\nSurgery can be performed to reduce elephantiasis by\nremoving excess fatty and fibrous tissue, draining theswelled area, and removing the dead worms.\nPrognosis\nWith DEC treatment, the prognosis is good for early\nand mild cases of lymphatic filariasis. The prognosis ispoor, however, for heavy parasitic infestations.\nPrevention\nThe two main ways to control this disease are to take\nDEC preventively, which has shown to be effective, andto reduce the number of carrier insects in a particular area.\nAvoiding mosquito bites with insecticides and insect\nrepellents is helpful, as is wearing protective clothingand using bed netting.\nMuch effort has been made in cleaning the breeding\nsites (stagnant water) of mosquitoes near people’s homesin areas where filariasis is found.\nBefore visiting countries where lymphatic filariasis\nis found, it would be wise to consult a travel physician tolearn about current preventative measures.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAsh, Laurence R.

    "content": "Embolism\nDefinition\nAn embolism is an obstruction in a blood vessel due\nto a blood clot or other foreign matter that gets stuckwhile traveling through the bloodstream. The plural ofembolism is emboli.\nDescription\nEmboli have moved from the place where they were\nformed through the bloodstream to another part of thebody, where they obstruct an artery and block the flow ofblood. The emboli are usually formed from blood clotsbut are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis-sue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or singleand massive. They can be life-threatening and requireimmediate emergency medical care. There are three gen-eral categories of emboli: arterial, gas, and pulmonary.Pulmonary emboli are the most common.\nArterial embolism\nIn arterial emboli, blood flow is blocked at the junc-\ntion of major arteries, most often at the groin, knee, orthigh. Arterial emboli are generally a complication ofheart disease. An arterial embolism in the brain (cere-bral embolism) causes stroke , which can be fatal. An\nestimated 5–14% of all strokes are caused by cerebralemboli. Arterial emboli to the extremities can lead to tis-sue death and amputation of the affected limb if not\ntreated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneyscan also suffer damage from emboli.\nGas embolism\nGas emboli result from the compression of respira-\ntory gases into the blood and other tissues due to rapidchanges in environmental pressure, for example, whileflying or scuba diving. As external pressure decreases,gases (like nitrogen) that are dissolved in the blood andother tissues become small bubbles that can block bloodflow and cause organ damage.\nPulmonary embolism\nIn a pulmonary embolism , a common illness, blood\nflow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli blockthe main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there areno initial symptoms, a pulmonary embolism can quicklybecome fatal. According to the American Heart Associa-tion, an estimated 600,000 Americans develop pulmonaryemboli annually and 60,000 die from it.\nA pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose. Less\nthan 10% of patients who die from a pulmonaryembolism were diagnosed with the condition. More than90% of cases of pulmonary emboli are complications ofdeep vein thrombosis , blood clots in the deep vein of\nthe leg or pelvis.\nCauses and symptoms\nArterial emboli are usually a complication of heart\ndisease where blood clots form in the heart’s chambers.Gas emboli are caused by rapid changes in environmen-tal pressure that could happen when flying or scuba div-ing. A pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots thattravel through the blood stream to the lungs and block apulmonary artery. More than 90% of the cases of pul-monary embolism are a complication of deep veinthrombosis, which typically occurs in patients who havehad orthopedic surgery and patients with cancer or\nother chronic illnesses like congestive heart failure .\nRisk factors for arterial and pulmonary emboli\ninclude: prolonged bed rest, surgery, childbirth ,heart\nattack , stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer, obesity ,a\nbroken hip or leg, oral contraceptives , sickle cell ane-\nmia, chest trauma, certain congenital heart defects, andold age. Risk factors for gas emboli include: scuba div-ing, amateur plane flight, exercise , injury, obesity, dehy-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1169EmbolismGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1169dration , excessive alcohol, colds, and medications such\nas narcotics and antihistamines .\nCommon symptoms of a pulmonary embolism\ninclude:\n• labored breathing, sometimes accompanied by chest\npain\n• a rapid pulse\n•a  cough that may produce sputum\n• a low-grade fever\n• fluid build-up in the lungs\nLess common symptoms include:\n• coughing up blood• pain caused by movement or breathing\n• leg swelling\n• bluish skin• fainting• swollen neck veins\nSymptoms of an arterial embolism include:\n• severe pain in the area of the embolism\n• pale, bluish cool skin\n• numbness• tingling• muscular weakness or paralysis\nDiagnosis\nAn embolism can be diagnosed through the patient’s\nhistory, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. For arterialemboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography areordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray , lung\nscan, pulmonary angiography ,electrocardiography ,arterial blood gas measurements, and venography or\nvenous ultrasound could be ordered.\nDiagnosing an arterial embolism\nUltrasound uses sound waves to create an image of\nthe heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gelto a hand-held transducer then presses it against thepatient’s body. The ultrasound’s sound waves arteries areconverted into an image that can be displayed on a moni-tor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, thetest takes 30–60 minutes.\nAn arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi-\num is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. Itcan be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, ordiagnostic center of a hospital.\nDiagnosing a pulmonary embolism\nA chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect\nother respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan showspoor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. Thepatient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceuticaland pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with agamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical isinjected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned.A normal result essentially rules out a pulmonaryembolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital oran outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes.\nPulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for\ndiagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used oftenbecause it is expensive, invasive, and not readily availablein most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographictest which involves injection of a radio contrast agent toshow the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera recordsthe blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul-monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital’sradiology medicine department and takes 30–60 minutes.\nAn electrocardiograph shows the heart’s electrical\nactivity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolismfrom a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conductingjelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.Impulses of the heart’s activity are traced on paper. Thetest takes about 10 minutes.\nArterial blood gas measurements are sometimes\nhelpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonaryembolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of avein, usually in the wrist.\nVenography is used to look for the most likely\nsource of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis.It is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it ispainful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly highdose of radiation, and can cause complications. Venogra-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1170Embolism\nA close up view of a pulmonary embolism. (Custom Medical\nStock Photo.

A contrast solution isinjected into a foot vein through a catheter. The physicianobserves the movement of the solution through the veinwith a fluoroscope while a series of x rays are taken.Venography takes between 30–45 minutes and can bedone in a physician’s office, a laboratory, or a hospital.Radionuclide venography, in which a radioactive isotopeis injected, is occasionally used, especially if a patienthas had reactions to contrast solutions. Venous ultra-sound is the preferred evaluation of leg veins.\nTreatment\nPatients with emboli require immediate hospitaliza-\ntion. They are generally treated with clot-dissolvingand/or clot-preventing drugs. Thrombolytic therapy to\ndissolve blood clots is the definitive treatment for a verysevere pulmonary embolism. Streptokinase, urokinase,and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) areused. Heparin is the anticoagulant drug of choice for pre-venting formation of blood clots. Warfarin, an oral anti-coagulant, is sometimes used concurrently and is usuallycontinued after the hospitalization.\nIn the case of an arterial embolism, the affected limb\nis placed in a dependent position and kept warm.Embolectomy is the treatment of choice in the majorityof early cases of arterial emboli in the extremities. In thisprocedure, a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into theartery to remove thromboembolic matter.\nWith a pulmonary embolism, oxygen therapy is\noften used to maintain normal oxygen concentrations.For people who can’t take anticoagulants and in someother cases, surgery may be needed to insert a device thatfilters blood returning to the heart and lungs.\nPrognosis\nOf patients hospitalized with an arterial embolism,\n25–30% die, and 5–25% require amputation of a limb.About 10% of patients with a pulmonary embolism diesuddenly within the first hour of onset of the condition.The outcome for all other patients is generally good; only3% of patients die who are properly diagnosed early andtreated. In cases of an undiagnosed pulmonaryembolism, about 30% of patients die.\nPrevention\nEmbolism can be prevented in high risk patients\nthrough antithrombotic drugs such as heparin, venousinterruption, gradient elastic stockings, and intermittentpneumatic compression of the legs. The combination ofKEY TERMS\nAnticoagulants —Drugs that suppress, delay, or\nprevent blood clots. Anticoagulants are used totreat embolisms.\nArtery —A blood vessel that carries blood from the\nheart to other body tissues. Embolisms obstructarteries.\nDeep vein thrombosis —A blood clot in the calf’s\ndeep vein. This frequently leads to pulmonaryembolism if untreated.\nEmboli —Clots or other substances that travel\nthrough the blood stream and get stuck in anartery, blocking circulation.\nThrombolytics —Drugs that dissolve blood clots.\nThrombolytics are used to treat embolisms.\ngraduated compression stockings and low-dose heparin is\nsignificantly more effective than low-dose heparin alone.\nGradient elastic stockings, also called anti-embolism\nstockings, decrease the risk of blood clots by compress-ing superficial leg veins and forcing blood into the deepveins. They can be knee-, thigh-, or waist-length. Manyphysicians order the use of stockings before surgery anduntil there is no longer an elevated risk of developingblood clots. The risk of deep vein thrombosis aftersurgery is reduced 50% with the use of these stockings.The American Heart Association recommends that theuse of graduated compression stockings be consideredfor all high-risk surgical patients.\nIntermittent pneumatic compression involves wrap-\nping knee- or thigh-high cuffs around the legs to preventblood clots. The cuffs are connected to a pump whichinflates and deflates, mimicking the heart’s normal pump-ing action and reducing the pooling of blood. Intermittentpneumatic compression can be used during surgery andrecovery and continues until there is no longer an elevatedrisk of developing blood clots. The American Heart Asso-ciation recommends the use of intermittent pneumaticcompression for patients who cannot take anticoagulants,for example, spinal cord and brain trauma patients.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Arterial Occlusive Disease.” In Professional Guide to Diseases.\n5th ed.

    "title": "Emphysema",
    "content": "Emphysema\nDefinition\nEmphysema is a chronic respiratory disease where\nthere is over-inflation of the air sacs (alveoli) in thelungs, causing a decrease in lung function, and often,breathlessness.\nDescription\nEmphysema is the most common cause of death\nfrom respiratory disease in the United States, and is thefourth most common cause of death overall. There are1.8 million Americans with the disease, which ranks fif-teenth among chronic conditions that cause limitations ofactivity. The disease is usually caused by smoking , but a\nsmall number of cases are caused by an inherited defect.\nNormally functioning lungs are elastic, efficiently\nexpanding and recoiling as air passes freely through thebronchus to the alveoli, where oxygen is moved into theblood and carbon dioxide is filtered out. When a personinhales cigarette smoke or certain other irritants, his orher immune system responds by releasing substancesthat are meant to defend the lungs against the smoke.These substances can also attack the cells of the lungs,but the body normally inhibits such action with therelease of other substances. In smokers and those withthe inherited defect, however, no such prevention occursand the lung tissue is damaged in such a way that it losesits elasticity. The small passageways (bronchioles) lead-ing to the alveoli collapse, trapping air within the alveoli.The alveoli, unable to recoil efficiently and move the airout, over expand and rupture. As the disease progresses,coughing and shortness of breath occur. In the later\nstages, the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to theblood. Emphysema often occurs with other respiratorydiseases, particularly chronic bronchitis . These two dis-\neases are often referred to as one disorder called chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nEmphysema is most common among people aged 50\nand older. Those with inherited emphysema may experiencethe onset as early as their thirties or fourties Men are morelikely than women to develop emphysema, but female casesare increasing as the number of female smokers rises.\nCauses and symptoms\nHeavy cigarette smoking causes about 80–90% of\nall emphysema cases. However a few cases are the resultof an inherited deficiency of a substance called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). The number of Americans with thisdeficiency is relatively small, probably no greater than70,000. Pipe, cigar, and marijuana smoking can alsodamage the lungs. While a person may be less likely toinhale cigar and pipe smoke, these types of smoke canalso impair lung function. Marijuana smoke may be evenmore damaging because it is inhaled deeply and held inby the smoker.\nThe symptoms of emphysema develop gradually\nover many years. It is a common occurrence for manyemphysema patients to have lost over half of their func-tioning lung tissue before they become aware that some-thing is wrong. Shortness of breath, a chronic mild cough\n(which may be productive of large amounts of dark, thicksputum, and often dismissed as “smoker’s cough”), andsometimes weight loss are associated with emphysema.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1172EmphysemaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1172Initially, a patient may only notice shortness of breath\nwhen he or she is exercising. However, as the disease pro-gresses, it will occur with less exertion or no exertion atall. Emphysema patients may also develop an enlarged, or“barrel,” chest. Other symptoms may be skipped breaths,difficulty sleeping, morning headaches, increased diffi-culty breathing while lying down, chronic fatigue , and\nswelling of the feet, ankles, or legs. Those with emphyse-ma are at risk for a variety of other complications result-ing from weakened lung function, including pneumonia .\nDiagnosis\nA variety of pulmonary function tests may be\nordered. In the early stages of emphysema, the onlyresult may be dysfunction of the small airways. Patientswith emphysema may show an increase in the totalamount of air that is in the lungs (total lung capacity), buta decrease in the amount of air that can be breathed outafter taking a deep breath (vital capacity). With severeemphysema, vital capacity is substantially below normal.Spirometry, a procedure that measures air flow and lungvolume, helps in the diagnosis of emphysema.\nA chest x ray is often ordered to aid in the diagnosis\nof emphysema, though patients in the early stages of thedisease may have normal findings. Abnormal findings onthe chest x ray include over-inflation of the lungs and anabnormally increased chest diameter. The diaphragm mayappear depressed or flattened. In addition, patients withadvanced emphysema may show a smaller or verticalheart. The physician may observe blisters in the lungs andbulging of the accessory muscles of the respiratory sys-tem. Late in the disease, an EKG will show signs of rightventricular failure in the heart and increased hemoglobindue to lower levels of oxygen in the patient’s blood.\nTreatment\nTreatment methods for emphysema do not cure or\nreverse the damage to the lungs. However, they may slowthe progression of the disease, relieve symptoms, andhelp control possibly fatal complications. The first stepin treatment for smokers is to quit, so as to prevent anyfurther deterioration of breathing ability. Smoking cessa-tion programs may be effective. Consistent encourage-ment along with the help of health care professionals aswell as family and friends can help increase the successrate of someone attempting to quit.\nIf the patient and the health care team develop and\nmaintain a complete program of respiratory care, disabil-ity can be decreased, acute episodes of illness may beprevented, and the number of hospitalizations reduced.However, only quitting smoking has been shown to slowdown the progression of the disease, and among all othertreatments, only oxygen therapy has shown an increase\nin the survival rate.\nHome oxygen therapy may improve the survival\ntimes in those patients with advanced emphysema whoalso have low blood oxygen levels. It may improve thepatient’s tolerance of exercise , as well as improve their\nperformance in certain aspects of brain function andmuscle coordination. The functioning of the heart mayalso improve with an increased concentration of oxygenin the blood. Oxygen may also decrease insomnia and\nheadaches. Some patients may only receive oxygen atnight, but studies have illustrated that it is most effectivewhen administered at least 18, but preferably 24 hoursper day. Portable oxygen tanks prescribed to patientscarry a limited supply and must be refilled on a regularbasis by a home health provider. Medicare and mostinsurance companies cover a large proportion of the costof home oxygen therapy. Patients should be instructedregarding special safety issues involving the transportand presence of oxygen in the home.\nA variety of medications may be used in the treat-\nment of emphysema. Usually the patient responds best toa combination of medicines, rather than one single drug.\nBronchodilators are sometimes used to help alle-\nviate the patient’s symptoms by relaxing and openingthe airways. They can be inhaled, taken by mouth, orinjected. Another category of medication often used iscorticosteroids or steroids. These help to decrease the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1173Emphysema\nA scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of lung tissue indi-\ncating emphysema.

They are occasional-\nly used if bronchodilators are ineffective in preventingairway obstruction. Some patients’ lung functionimproves with corticosteroids, and inhaled steroids maybe beneficial to patients with few side effects. A varietyof antibiotics are frequently given at the first sign of a\nrespiratory infection, such as increased amounts of spu-tum, or if there has been a change in the color of thesputum. Expectorants can help to loosen respiratory\nsecretions, enabling the patient to more easily expelthem from the airways.\nMany of the medications prescribed involve the use\nof a metered dose inhaler (MDI) that may require specialinstruction to be used correctly. MDIs are a convenientand safe method of delivering medication to the lungs.However, if they are used incorrectly the medication willnot get to the right place. Proper technique is essentialfor the medication to be effective.\nFor some patients, surgical treatment may be the\nbest option. Lung volume reduction surgery is a surgicalprocedure in which the most diseased parts of the lungare removed to enable the remaining lung and breathingmuscles to work more efficiently. Preliminary studiessuggest improved survival rates and better functioningwith the surgery. Another surgical procedure used foremphysema patients is lung transplantation . Trans-\nplantation may involve one or both lungs. However, it isa risky and expensive procedure, and donor organs maynot be available.For those patients with advanced emphysema, keep-\ning the air passages reasonably clear of secretions canprove difficult. Some common methods for mobilizingand removing secretions include:\n• Postural drainage. This helps to remove secretions from\nthe airways. The patient lies in a position that allowsgravity to aid in draining different parts of the lung.This is often done after the patient inhales an aerosolmedication. The basic position involves the patientlying on the bed with his chest and head over the sideand the forearms resting on the floor.\n• Chest percussion. This technique involves lightly clap-\nping the back and chest, and may help to loosen thicksecretions.\n• Coughing and deep breathing. These techniques may\naid the patient in bringing up secretions.\n• Aerosol treatments. These treatments may involve solu-\ntions of saline, often mixed with a bronchodilator,which are then inhaled as an aerosol. The aerosols thinand loosen secretions. A treatment normally takes 10 to15 minutes, and is given three or four times a day.\nPatients with COPD can learn to perform a variety\nof self-help measures that may help improve their symp-toms and their ability to participate in everyday activi-ties. These measures include:\n• Avoiding any exposure to dusts and fumes.• Avoiding air pollution, including the cigarette smoke of\nothers.\n• Avoiding other people who have infections like the cold\nor flu. Get a pneumonia vaccination and a yearly flu\nshot.\n• Drinking plenty of fluids. This helps to loosen respira-\ntory secretions so they can be brought up more easilythrough coughing.\n• Avoiding extreme temperatures of heat or cold. Also\navoiding high altitudes. (Special precautions can betaken that may enable the emphysema patient to fly ona plane.)\n• Maintaining adequate nutritional intake. Normally a\nhigh protein diet taken in many small feedings is rec-ommended.\nAlternative treatment\nMany patients are interested in whether any alterna-\ntive treatments for emphysema are available. Some prac-titioners recommend supplements of antioxidant nutri-ents. There have also been some studies indicating a cor-relation between a low Vitamin A levels and COPD, withsuggestions that supplements of vitamin A might be ben-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1174Emphysema\nX ray showing emphysema in the lungs.

Aromatherapists have used essential oils like\neucalyptus, lavender, pine, and rosemary to help relievenasal congestion and make breathing easier. The herbelecampane may act as an expectorant to help patientsclear mucus from the lungs. The patient should discussthese remedies with their health care practitioner prior totrying them, as some may interact with the more tradi-tional treatments that are already being used.\nPrognosis\nEmphysema is a serious and chronic disease that\ncannot be reversed. If detected early, the effects andprogression can be slowed, particularly if the patientstops smoking immediately. Complications of emphy-sema include higher risks for pneumonia and acutebronchitis. Overall, the prognosis for patients withemphysema is poor, with a survival rate for all thosewith COPD of four years, and even less for emphyse-ma. However, individual cases vary and many patientscan live much longer with supplemental oxygen andother treatment measures.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent emphysema is to avoid\nsmoking. Even patients with inherited emphysemashould avoid smoking, as it especially worsens the onsetand severity. If patients quit smoking as soon as evidenceof small airway obstruction begins, they can significantlyimprove their prognosis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBeers, Mark H., and Robert Berkow, eds.

    "title": "Empyema",
    "content": "Empyema\nDefinition\nEmpyema is a condition in which pus and fluid from\ninfected tissue collects in a body cavity. The name comesfrom the Greek word empyein meaning pus-producing\n(suppurate). Empyema is most often used to refer to col-lections of pus in the space around the lungs (pleural cav-ity), but sometimes refers to similar collections in thegall bladder or the pelvic cavity. Empyema in the pleuralcavity is sometimes called empyema thoracis, or empye-ma of the chest, to distinguish it from empyema else-where in the body.\nDescription\nEmpyema may have a number of causes but is most\nfrequently a complication of pneumonia . Its develop-\nment can be divided into three phases: an acute phase inwhich the body cavity fills with a thin fluid containingsome pus; a second stage in which the fluid thickens anda fibrous, coagulation protein (fibrin) begins to accumu-late within the cavity; and a third or chronic stage inwhich the lung or other organ is encased within a thickcovering of fibrous material.\nCauses and symptoms\nEmpyema thoracis can be caused by a number of dif-\nferent organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and amebas, inconnection with pneumonia, chest wounds , chest surgery,\nlung abscesses, or a ruptured esophagus. The infectiveorganism can get into the pleural cavity either through thebloodstream or other circulatory system, in secretionsfrom lung tissue, or on the surfaces of surgical instrumentsor objects that cause open chest wounds. The most com-mon organisms that cause empyema are the following bac-teria: Streptococcus pneumoniae ,Haemophilus influenzae,\nand Staphylococcus aureus . S. aureus is the most common\ncause in all age groups, accounting for 90% of cases ofempyema in infants and children. Pelvic empyema in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1175EmpyemaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1175women is most often caused by Bacteroides strains or\nPseudomonas aeruginosa . In elderly, chronically ill, or\nalcoholic patients, empyema is often caused by Klebsiella\npneumoniae species of bacteria.\nWhen the disease organisms arrive in the cavity sur-\nrounding the lungs, they infect the tissues that cover thelungs and line the chest wall. As the body attempts tofight off the infection, the cavity fills up with tissue fluid,pus, and dead tissue cells. Empyema of the gall bladderor pelvis results from similar reactions to infection inthose parts of the body.\nThe signs and symptoms of empyema vary some-\nwhat according to the location of the infection and itsseverity. In empyema thoracis, patients usually exhibitsymptoms of pneumonia, including fever ,cough ,\nfatigue ,shortness of breath , and chest pain .

Family members may notice bad breath . In\nsevere cases, the patient may become dehydrated, coughup blood or greenish-brown sputum, run a fever as highas 105°F (40.6°C), or fall into a coma .\nPatients with thoracic empyema may develop poten-\ntially life-threatening complications if the condition isnot treated. The infected tissues may develop large col-lections of pus (abscesses) that can rupture into thepatient’s airway, or the infection may spread to the tis-sues surrounding the heart. In extreme cases the empye-ma may spread to the brain by means of bacteria carriedin the bloodstream.\nIn pelvic empyema, the infection produces large\namounts of thick, foul-smelling pus that is rapidlyreplaced even after drainage. Empyema of the gallblad-der is marked by intense pain on the upper right side ofthe abdomen, high fever, and rigidity of the muscles overthe infected area.\nDiagnosis\nA physician may consider the possibility of empye-\nma thoracis in patients with pneumonia or other symp-toms of lung infection. When listening to sounds withinthe patient’s chest with a stethoscope, the sounds ofbreathing will be partly muffled and harder to hear in thepatients with empyema. The area of the chest over theinfection will sound dull when tapped or thumped (per-cussed). On an x ray, empyema thoracis will appear as acloudy or opaque area. The amount of fluid present in thepleural cavity can be estimated using an ultrasoundimaging procedure. The diagnosis of empyema, however,has to be confirmed with laboratory tests because itssymptoms can be caused by other disease conditions.\nThe diagnosis of empyema is usually confirmed by\nanalyzing a sample of fluid taken from the pleural cavity.The sample is obtained by a procedure called thoracente-\nsis. In this procedure, the patient is given a local anesthet-\nic, a needle is inserted into the pleural cavity through theback between the ribs on the infected side, and a sampleof fluid is withdrawn. If the patient has empyema, therewill be a very high level of one particular kind of immunecell (white blood cells), a high level of protein, and a verylow level of blood sugar. The fluid can also be tested forthe specific disease organism by staining or tissue cul-tures. In some cases, the color, smell, or consistency ofthe tissue fluid also helps to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nEmpyema is treated using a combination of medica-\ntions and surgical techniques.

It is important to give antibiotics as soon\nas possible to prevent first-stage empyema from progress-ing to its later stages. The antibiotics most commonlyused are penicillin and vancomycin. Patients experiencingdifficulty breathing are also given oxygen therapy.\nSurgical treatment of empyema has two goals:\ndrainage of the infected fluid and closing up of the spaceleft in the pleural cavity. If the infection is still in its earlystages, the fluid can be drained by thoracentesis. In sec-ond-stage empyema, the surgeon will insert a chest tube inthe patient’s rib cage or remove part of a rib (rib resection)in order to drain the fluid. In third-stage empyema, the sur-geon may cut or peel away the thick fibrous layer coatingthe lung. This procedure is called decortication. When thefibrous covering is removed, the lung will expand to fillthe space in the chest cavity. The doctor can use video-assisted thoracic surgery (V ATS) techniques to position\nthe chest tube or to perform a limited decortication. TheV ATS technique allows a physician to see within the bodyduring certain surgical procedures. Empyema of the gall-bladder is a serious condition that is treated with intra-venous antibiotics and surgical removal of the gallbladder.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery is generally good, except\nin those cases with complications, such as a brain\nabscess or blood poisoning , or cases caused by certain\ntypes of streptococci.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Bedside Procedures: Thoracentesis.” In Surgery On Call ,e d .\nLeonard G.

    "title": "Encephalitis",
    "content": "Encephalitis\nDefinition\nEncephalitis is an inflammation of the brain, usually\ncaused by a direct viral infection or a hypersensitivityreaction to a virus or foreign protein. Brain inflammationcaused by a bacterial infection is sometimes calledcerebritis. When both the brain and spinal cord areinvolved, the disorder is called encephalomyelitis. Aninflammation of the brain’s covering, or meninges, iscalled meningitis .\nDescription\nEncephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The\ninflammation is a reaction of the body’s immune systemto infection or invasion. During the inflammation, thebrain’s tissues become swollen. The combination of theinfection and the immune reaction to it can causeheadache and a fever , as well as more severe symptoms\nin some cases.\nApproximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis are\nreported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,GA each year. The viruses causing primary encephalitiscan be epidemic or sporadic. The polio virus is an epi-\ndemic cause. Arthropod-borne viral encephalitis isresponsible for most epidemic viral encephalitis. Theviruses live in animal hosts and mosquitos that transmitthe disease. The most common form of non-epidemic orsporadic encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplexvirus, type 1 (HSV-1) and has a high rate of death .\nMumps is another example of a sporadic cause.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThere are more than a dozen viruses that can cause\nencephalitis, spread by either human-to human contact orby animal bites. Encephalitis may occur with severalcommon viral infections of childhood. Viruses and viraldiseases that may cause encephalitis include:\n•chickenpox\n•measles\n• mumps\n• Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1177EncephalitisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1177• cytomegalovirus infection\n• HIV\n• herpes simplex\n• herpes zoster ( shingles )\n• herpes B\n• polio\n•rabies\n• mosquito-borne viruses (arboviruses)\nPrimary encephalitis is caused by direct infection by\nthe virus, while secondary encephalitis is due to a post-infectious immune reaction to viral infection elsewhere inthe body. Secondary encephalitis may occur with measles,chickenpox, mumps, rubella , and EBV . In secondary\nencephalitis, symptoms usually begin five to 10 days afterthe onset of the disease itself and are related to the break-down of the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers.\nIn rare cases, encephalitis may follow vaccination\nagainst some of the viral diseases listed above.Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a very rare brain disorder\ncaused by an infectious particle called a prion, may alsocause encephalitis.\nMosquitoes spread viruses responsible for equine\nencephalitis (eastern and western types), St. Louisencephalitis, California encephalitis, and Japanese\nencephalitis . Lyme disease , spread by ticks, can cause\nencephalitis, as can Colorado tick fever. Rabies is mostoften spread by animal bites from dogs, cats, mice, rac-coons, squirrels, and bats and may cause encephalitis.\nEquine encephalitis is carried by mosquitoes that do\nnot normally bite humans but do bite horses and birds. Itis occasionally picked up from these animals by mosqui-toes that do bite humans. Japanese encephalitis and St.Louis encephalitis are also carried by mosquitoes. Therisk of contracting a mosquito-borne virus is greatest inmid- to late summer, when mosquitoes are most active,in those rural areas where these viruses are known toexist. Eastern equine encephalitis occurs in eastern andsoutheastern United States; western equine and Califor-nia encephalitis occur throughout the West; and St. Louisencephalitis occurs throughout the country. Japaneseencephalitis does not occur in the United States, but isfound throughout much of Asia. The viruses responsiblefor these diseases are classified as arbovirus and thesediseases are collectively called arbovirus encephalitis .\nHerpes simplex encephalitis, the most common form\nof sporadic encephalitis in western countries, is a diseasewith significantly high mortality. It occurs in children andadults and both sides of the brain are affected. It is theo-rized that brain infection is caused by the virus movingfrom a peripheral location to the brain via two nerves, the\nolfactory and the trigeminal (largest nerves in the skull).\nHerpes simplex encephalitis is responsible for 10%\nof all encephalitis cases and is the main cause of spo-radic, fatal encephalitis. In untreated patients, the rate ofdeath is 70% while the mortality is 15–20% in patientswho have been treated with acyclovir. The symptoms ofherpes simplex encephalitis are fever, rapidly disintegrat-ing mental state, headache, and behavioral changes.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of encephalitis range from very mild\nto very severe and may include:\n• headache•f e v e r• lethargy (sleepiness, decreased alertness, and fatigue )\n• malaise\n• nausea and vomiting• visual disturbances• tremor\n• decreased consciousness (drowsiness, confusion, delir-\nium, and unconsciousness)\n• stiff neck• seizures\nSymptoms may progress rapidly, changing from\nmild to severe within several days or even several hours.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of encephalitis includes careful question-\ning to determine possible exposure to viral sources. Teststhat can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out otherdisorders include:\n• Blood tests. These are to detect antibodies to viral anti-\ngens, and foreign proteins.\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (spinal tap). This detects\nviral antigens, and provides culture specimens for thevirus or bacteria that may be present in the cere-brospinal fluid.\n• Electroencephalogram (EEG).\n• CT and MRI scans.\nA brain biopsy (surgical gathering of a small tissue\nsample) may be recommended in some cases wheretreatment to date has been ineffective and the cause ofthe encephalitis is unclear. Definite diagnosis by biopsymay allow specific treatment that would otherwise betoo risky.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1178EncephalitisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1178Treatment\nChoice of treatment for encephalitis will depend on\nthe cause. Bacterial encephalitis is treated with antibi-\notics . Viral encephalitis is usually treated with antiviral\ndrugs including acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, ribo-\nvarin, and AZT. Viruses that respond to acyclovir includeherpes simplex, the most common cause of sporadic(non-epidemic) encephalitis in the United States.\nThe symptoms of encephalitis may be treated with a\nnumber of different drugs. Corticosteroids , including\nprednisone and dexamethasone, are sometimes pre-scribed to reduce inflammation and brain swelling. Anti-\nconvulsant drugs , including dilantin and phenytoin, are\nused to control seizures. Fever may be reduced withacetaminophen or other fever-reducing drugs.\nA person with encephalitis must be monitored care-\nfully, since symptoms may change rapidly. Blood testsmay be required regularly to track levels of fluids andsalts in the blood.\nPrognosis\nEncephalitis symptoms may last several weeks.\nMost cases of encephalitis are mild, and recovery is usu-ally quick. Mild encephalitis usually leaves no residualneurological problems. Overall, approximately 10% ofthose with encephalitis die from their infections or com-plications such as secondary infection. Some forms ofencephalitis have more severe courses, including herpesencephalitis, in which mortality is 15–20% with treat-ment, and 70–80% without. Antiviral treatment is inef-fective for eastern equine encephalitis, and mortality isapproximately 30%.\nPermanent neurological consequences may follow\nrecovery in some cases. Consequences may include per-sonality changes, memory loss, language difficulties,seizures, and partial paralysis .\nPrevention\nBecause encephalitis is due to infection, it may be\nprevented by avoiding the infection. Minimizing contactwith others who have any of the viral illness listed abovemay reduce the chances of becoming infected. Mostinfections are spread by hand-to-hand or hand-to-mouthcontact; frequent hand washing may reduce the likeli-hood of infection if contact cannot be avoided.\nMosquito-borne viruses may be avoided by prevent-\ning mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active at dawnand dusk, and are most common in moist areas withstanding water. Minimizing exposed skin and use ofmosquito repellents on other areas can reduce thechances of being bitten.KEY TERMS\nCerebrospinal fluid analysis —A analysis that is\nimportant in diagnosing diseases of the centralnervous system.

    "title": "Endarterectomy",
    "content": "Endarterectomy\nDefinition\nEndarterectomy is an operation to remove or bypass\nthe fatty deposits, or blockage, in an artery narrowed bythe buildup of fatty tissue ( atherosclerosis ).\nPurpose\nRemoving the fatty deposits restores normal blood\nflow to the part of the body supplied by the artery. Anendarterectomy is performed to treat cerebrovascular dis-ease in which there is a serious reduction of blood supplyto the brain (carotid endarterectomy), or to treat periph-\neral vascular disease (impaired blood supply to the legs).\nEndarterectomy is most often performed on one of\nthe two main arteries in the neck (the carotids) openingthe narrowed arteries leading to the brain. When per-formed by an experienced surgeon, the practice isextremely effective, reducing the risk of stroke by up to\n70%. Recent studies indicate it is effective in preventingstroke, even among those patients who had no warningsigns except narrowed arteries detected by their doctorson a routine exam.\nPrecautions\nBefore the surgery, a full medical exam is usually\ndone to assess any specific health problems, such as dia-betes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke. Ifpossible, reversible health problems, such as cigarettesmoking or being overweight, should be corrected.\nDescription\nCarotid artery disease\nEvery person has four carotid arteries (the internal\nand external carotids on each side of the neck) throughwhich blood from the heart moves into the brain. If oneof these arteries becomes blocked by fat and cholesterol,the patient may have a range of symptoms, including:• weakness in one arm, leg, half of the face, or one entire\nside of the body\n• numbness tingling•paralysis of an arm, leg, or face\n• slurred speech\n• dizziness\n• confusion, fainting, or coma\n• stroke\nRemoving this fatty buildup, or bypassing a blocked\nsegment, may restore blood flow to the brain, eliminateor decrease the symptoms, and lessen the risk of a stroke.\nPeripheral vascular disease\nWhen the blood vessels in the legs (and sometimes\nthe arms) become narrowed, this can restrict blood flowand cause pain in the affected area. In severe cases, the\ntissue may die, requiring amputation .\nThe narrowing is usually caused by buildup of fatty\nplaques in the vessels, often as the result of smoking,high blood pressure, or poorly-controlled diabetes melli-\ntus. The vessels usually narrow slowly, but it’s possible\nfor a blood clot to form quickly, causing sudden severepain in the affected leg or arm.\nProcedure\nEndarterectomy is a delicate operation that may\nrequire several hours. The surgeon begins by making an\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1180EndarterectomyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1180incision over the blocked artery and inserting a tube\nabove and below the blockage to redirect the blood flowwhile the artery is opened.\nNext, the surgeon removes the fat and cholesterol\nbuildup, along with any blood clots that have formed,with a blunt dissecting instrument. Then the surgeonbathes the clean wall in salt solution combined withheparin, an anticoagulant. Then the surgeon stitches theartery just enough so that the bypass shunt tube can beremoved, and then he/she stitches the artery completelyclosed. After checking to make sure no blood is leaking,the surgeon next closes the skin incision with stitches.\nThe operation should improve symptoms, although\nits long-term effects may be more limited, since arterialnarrowing is rarely confined to one area of one artery. Ifnarrowing is a problem throughout the body, arterialreconstructive surgery may be required.\nThe total cost of an endarterectomy, including diag-\nnostic tests, surgery, hospitalization, and follow-up care,will vary according to hospital, doctor, and area of thecountry where the operation is performed, but a patientcan expect to pay in the range of $15,000. Patients who\nare very young, very old, or very ill, or who need moreextensive surgery, may require more expensive treatment.\nPreparation\nBefore surgery, the doctor pinpoints the location of\nthe narrowed artery with an x-ray procedure calledangiography . For surgery to be effective, the degree of\nnarrowing should be at least 70%, but it should not betotal. Patients undergoing angiography are given a localanesthetic, but the endarterectomy itself requires the useof a general anesthesia.\nAftercare\nAfter the surgery, the patient spends the first two\ndays lying flat in bed. Patients who have had carotidendarterectomy should not bend the neck sharply duringthis time. Because the blood flow to the brain is nowgreatly increased, patients may experience a brief butsevere headache , or lightheadedness. There may be a\nslight loss of sensation in the skin, or maybe a droop in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1181Endarterectomy\nPlaque\nClampCarotid\nartery\nPlaque is removed from the carotid artery by clamping the artery, cutting the plaque out, and closing the opening back up.\n(Illustration by Argosy Inc.)GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1181the mouth, if any of the nerves in the neck were lightly\nbruised during surgery. In time, this should correct itself.\nRisks\nThe amount of risk depends on the hospital, the skill\nof the surgeon, and the severity of underlying disease.Patients who have just had an acute stroke are at greatestrisk. During carotid artery surgery, blood flow is inter-rupted through the artery, so that paralysis and otherstroke symptoms may occur. These may resolve aftersurgery, or may result in permanent stroke. Paralysis isusually one-sided; other stroke symptoms may includeloss of half the field of vision, loss of sensation, doublevision, speech problems, and personality changes. Risksof endarterectomy to treat either carotid artery or periph-eral vascular disease include:\n• reactions to anesthesia• bleeding\n• infection\n• blood clots\nNormal results\nThe results after successful surgery are usually strik-\ning. The newly opened artery should help to restore nor-mal blood flow. In carotid endarterectomy, surgery shouldprevent the risk of brain damage and stroke.

In somecases, small pieces of plaque in the carotid arterymay break loose and block an artery in the brain.A narrowed carotid artery also can be the sourceof blood clots travelling to the brain, or the arterycan become completely clogged, blocking allblood flow to the brain.buildup of fat and cholesterol usually affects all arteries,\nnot just the one that was operated on. Affected arteries inother parts of the body may be equally clogged and poten-tially dangerous. Even arteries that were operated elec-tively will likely, begin to clog up again after the surgery.\nFor this reason, lifestyle changes (no smoking, low\nfat, low cholesterol diet) are important, especially if dietand lifestyle contributed to the development of the prob-lem in the first place.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Carotid Endarterectomy.” In The Surgery Book: An Illustrated\nGuide to 73 of the Most Common Operations , ed.

    "title": "Endocarditis",
    "content": "Endocarditis\nDefinition\nThe endocardium is the inner lining of the heart\nmuscle, which also covers the heart valves. When theendocardium becomes damaged, bacteria from the bloodstream can become lodged on the heart valves or heartlining. The resulting infection is known as endocarditis.\nDescription\nThe endocardium lines all four chambers of the\nheart—two at the top (the right and left atria) and two atthe bottom (the right and left ventricles)—through whichblood passes as the heart beats. It also covers the fourvalves (the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve, themitral valve, and the aortic valve), which normally open\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1182EndocarditisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1182and close to allow the blood to flow in only one direction\nthrough the heart during each contraction.\nFor the heart to pump blood efficiently, the four\nchambers must contract and relax, and the four valvesmust open and close, in a well coordinated fashion. Bydamaging the valves or the walls of the heart chambers,endocarditis can interfere with the ability of the heart todo its job.\nEndocarditis rarely occurs in people with healthy,\nnormal hearts. Rather, it most commonly occurs whenthere is damage to the endocardium. The endocardiummay be affected by a congenital heart defect, such asmitral valve prolapse , in which blood leaks through a\npoorly functioning mitral valve back into the heart. Itmay also be damaged by a prior scarring of the heartmuscle, such as rheumatic fever , or replacement of a\nheart valve. Any of these conditions can damage theendocardium and make it more susceptible to infection.\nBacteria can get into the blood stream (a condition\nknown as bacteremia ) in a number of different ways: It\nmay spread from a localized infection such as a urinarytract infection, pneumonia , or skin infection or get into\nthe blood stream as a result of certain medical condi-tions, such as severe periodontal disease ,colon cancer ,\nor inflammatory bowel disease. It can enter the bloodstream during minor procedures, such as periodontalsurgery, tooth extractions, teeth cleaning, tonsil removal,prostate removal, or endoscopic examination. It can alsobe introduced through in-dwelling catheters, which areused for intravenous medications, intravenous feeding, ordialysis. In people who use intravenous drugs, the bacte-ria can enter the blood stream through unsterilized, cont-aminated needles and syringes. (People who are prone toendocarditis generally need to take prescribed antibi-\notics before certain surgical or dental procedures to help\nprevent this infection.)\nIf not discovered and treated, infective endocarditis\ncan permanently damage the heart muscle, especially thevalves. For the heart to work properly, all four valvesmust be functioning well, opening at the right time to letblood flow in the right direction and closing at the righttime to keep the blood from flowing in the wrong direc-tion. If the valve is damaged, this may allow blood to flowbackward—a condition known as regurgitation. As aresult of a poorly functioning valve, the heart muscle hasto work harder to pump blood and may become weak-ened, leading to heart failure . Heart failure is a chronic\ncondition in which the heart is unable to pump blood wellenough to supply blood adequately to the body.\nAnother danger associated with endocarditis is that\nthe vegetation formed by bacteria colonizing on heartvalves may break off, forming emboli. These embolimay travel through the circulation and become lodged in\nblood vessels. By blocking the flow of blood, embolican starve various tissues of nutrients and oxygen, dam-aging them. For instance, an embolus lodged in theblood vessels of the lungs may cause pneumonia-likesymptoms. An embolus may also affect the brain, dam-aging nerve tissue, or the kidneys, causing kidney dis-ease. Emboli may also weaken the tiny blood vesselscalled capillaries, causing hemorrhages (leaking bloodvessels) throughout the body.\nCauses and symptoms\nMost cases of infective endocarditis occur in people\nbetween the ages of 15 and 60, with a median age atonset of about 50 years. Men are affected about twice asoften as women are. Other factors that put people atincreased risk for endocarditis are congenital heart prob-\nlems, heart surgery, previous episodes of endocarditis,and intravenous drug use.\nWhile there is no single specific symptom of endo-\ncarditis, a number of symptoms may be present. Themost common symptom is a mild fever , which rarely\ngoes above 102°F (38.9°C). Other symptoms includechills, weakness, cough , trouble breathing, headaches,\naching joints, and loss of appetite.\nEmboli may also cause a variety of symptoms,\ndepending on their location. Emboli throughout thebody may cause Osler’s nodes, small, reddish, painfulbumps most commonly found on the inside of fingersand toes. Emboli may also cause petechiae, tiny purple\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1183Endocarditis\nA close-up view of an infected artificial heart valve showing\nbacterial endocarditis (the granulated tissue at center ofimage).

Tiny hemorrhages resemblingsplinters may also appear under the fingernails or toe-nails. If emboli become lodged in the blood vessels ofthe lungs, they may cause coughing or shortness of\nbreath . Emboli lodged in the brain may cause symp-\ntoms of a mini-stroke, such as numbness, weakness, orparalysis on one side of the body or sudden vision loss\nor double vision. Emboli may also damage the kidneys,causing blood to appear in the urine. Sometimes the cap-illaries on the surface of the spleen rupture, causing thespleen to become enlarged and tender to the touch. Any-one experiencing any of these symptoms should seekmedical help immediately.\nDiagnosis\nDoctors begin the diagnosis by taking a history, ask-\ning the patient about the symptoms mentioned above.During a physical examination , the doctor may also\nuncover signs such as fever, an enlarged spleen, signs ofkidney disease, or hemorrhaging. Listening to thepatient’s chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may alsohear a heart murmur. A heart murmur may indicateabnormal flow of blood through one of the heart cham-bers or valves.\nDoctors take a sample of the patient’s blood to test it\nfor bacteria and other microorganisms that may be caus-ing the infection. They usually also use a test calledechocardiography , which uses ultrasound waves to\nmake images of the heart, to check for abnormalities inthe structure of the heart wall or valves. One of the tell-tale signs they look for in echocardiography is vegeta-tion, the abnormal growth of tissue around a valve com-posed of blood platelets, bacteria, and a clotting proteincalled fibrin. Another tell-tale sign is regurgitation, or the\nbackward flow of blood, through one of the heart valves.A normal echocardiogram does not exclude the possibili-ty of endocarditis, but an abnormal echocardiogram canconfirm its presence. If an echocardiogram cannot bedone or its results are inconclusive, a modified techniquecalled transesophageal echocardiography is some-\ntimes performed. Transesophageal echocardiographyinvolves passing an ultrasound device into the esophagusto get a clearer image of the heart.\nTreatment\nWhen doctors suspect infective endocarditis, they\nwill admit the patient to a hospital and begin treating theinfection before they even have the results of the blood\nculture . Their choice of antibiotics depends on what the\nmost likely infecting microorganism is. Once the resultsof the blood culture become available, the doctor canadjust the medications, using specific antibiotics knownto be effective against the specific microorganisminvolved.\nUnfortunately, in recent years, the treatment of\nendocarditis has become more complicated as a result ofantibiotic resistance. Over the past few years, especiallyas antibiotics have been overprescribed, more and morestrains of bacteria have become increasingly resistant toa wider range of antibiotics. For this reason, doctors mayneed to try a few different types of antibiotics—or even acombination of antibiotics—to successfully treat theinfection. Antibiotics are usually given for about onemonth, but may need to be given for an even longer peri-od of time if the infection is resistant to treatment.\nOnce the fever and the worst of the symptoms have\ngone away, the patient may be able to continue antibiotictherapy at home. During this time, the patient shouldmake regular visits to the health care team for furthertesting and physical examination to make sure that theantibiotic therapy is working, that it is not causingadverse side effects, and that there are no complicationssuch as emboli or heart failure. The patient should alertthe health-care team to any symptoms that could indicateserious complications: For instance, trouble breathing orswelling in the legs could indicate congestive heart fail-ure. Headache , joint pain , blood in the urine, or stroke\nsymptoms could indicate an embolus, and fever andchills could indicate that the treatment is not working andthe infection is worsening. Finally, diarrhea , rash, itch-\ning, or joint pain may suggest a bad reaction to the\nantibiotics. Anyone experiencing any of these symptomsshould alert the health care team immediately.\nIn some cases, surgery may be needed. These\ninclude cases of congestive heart failure, recurring\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1184Endocarditis\nThis echocardiogram shows an aortic regurgitation due to\nendocarditis, an infection of the lining membrane of the car-diac chambers.

The most common surgicaltreatment involves cutting away (debriding) damaged tis-sue and replacing the damaged valve.\nPrognosis\nIf left untreated, infective endocarditis continues to\nprogress and is always fatal. However, if it is diagnosedand properly treated within the first six weeks of infec-tion, the infection can be completely cured in about 90%of the cases. The prognosis depends on a number of fac-tors, such as the patient’s age and overall physical condi-tion, the severity of the diseases involved, the exact siteof the infection, how vulnerable the microorganisms areto antibiotics, and what kind of complications the endo-carditis may be causing.\nPrevention\nSome people are especially prone to endocarditis.\nThese include people with past episodes of endocarditis,those with congenital heart problems or heart damagefrom rheumatic fever, and those with artificial heartvalves. Intravenous drug users are also at increased risk.KEY TERMS\nAortic valve —The valve between the left ventricle\nof the heart and the aorta.\nBacteremia —An infection caused by bacteria in the\nblood.\nCongestive heart failure —A condition in which the\nheart muscle cannot pump blood as efficiently as itshould.\nEchocardiography —A diagnostic test using reflect-\ned sound waves to study the structure and motion ofthe heart muscle.\nEmbolus —A bit of foreign material, such as gas, a\npiece of tissue, or tiny clot, that travels in the circu-lation until it becomes lodged in a blood vessel.\nEndocardium —The inner wall of the heart muscle,\nwhich also covers the heart valves.\nMitral valve —The valve between the left atrium and\nthe left ventricle of the heart.\nOsler’s nodes —Small, raised, reddish, tender areasassociated with endocarditis, commonly found\ninside the fingers or toes.\nPetechiae —Tiny purple or red spots on the skin\nassociated with endocarditis, resulting from hemor-rhages under the skin’s surface.\nPulmonary valve —The valve between the right ven-\ntricle of the heart and the pulmonary artery.\nTransducer —A device that converts electrical sig-\nnals into ultrasound waves and ultrasound wavesback into electrical impulses.\nTransesophageal echocardiography —A diagnostic\ntest using an ultrasound device, passed into theesophagus of the patient, to create a clear image ofthe heart muscle.\nTricuspid valve —The valve between the right atri-\num and the right ventricle of the heart.\nVegetation —An abnormal growth of tissue around\na valve, composed of blood platelets, bacteria, anda protein involved in clotting.\nAnyone who falls into a high-risk category should alert\nhis or her health-care professionals before undergoingany surgical or dental procedures.

Abnormal bleedingincludes bleeding between menstrual periods, excessivebleeding during a menstrual period, or bleeding aftermenopause . Since abnormal uterine bleeding can indi-\ncate cancer , an endometrial biopsy is done to rule out\nendometrial cancer or hyperplasia (a potentially pre-\ncancerous condition).\nEndometrial biopsies are also done as a screening\ntest for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women onhormone replacement therapy . Hormone replacement\ntherapy usually requires a woman to take estrogen andprogesterone. An endometrial biopsy is particularly use-ful in cases where postmenopausal women take estrogen,but cannot take progesterone. Estrogen in the systemwithout the balancing effect of progesterone has beenlinked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\nAn endometrial biopsy can also be used as part of an\ninfertility exam to rule out problems with the develop-\nment of the endometrium. This condition is called lutealphase defect and can cause the endometrium to not sup-port a pregnancy . An endometrial biopsy can also be used\nto evaluate the problem of repeated early miscarriages.\nPrecautions\nIf the endometrial biopsy is being done to investigate\nwhy a woman is unable to get pregnant, the test must beperformed at a specific time during the menstrual cycle.Since the test evaluates whether the endometrium isdeveloped adequately to support implantation and growthof a fertilized egg, it is critical to perform the test approxi-mately three days before the expected menstrual period.\nDescription\nThe test is performed by a doctor who specializes in\nwomen’s reproductive health (an obstetrician/gynecolo-gist). The test is performed either in the doctor’s office orin a local hospital. The patient may be asked to take pain\nmedication (like Motrin or Aleve) an hour or so beforethe procedure. A local anesthetic may be injected into thecervix in order to decrease pain and discomfort duringthe procedure.The woman will be asked to lie on her back with\nknees apart and feet in stirrups. The doctor will first con-duct a thorough exam of the pelvic region, including thevulva (the external genitals), vagina, and uterus. A specu-lum (an instrument that is used to hold the walls of thevagina open) will be inserted into the vagina. A small,hollow plastic tube is then passed into the uterine cavity.A small piece of the uterine lining is sucked out with aplunger that is attached to the tube. Once the sample isobtained, the instruments are removed. The sample issent to the laboratory for microscopic examination.\nThe patient may experience some pain when the\ncervix is grasped. The patient may also feel some cramp-ing, pressure, and discomfort when the instruments areinserted into the uterus and the tissue sample is collected.\nPreparation\nFor the small number of endometrial biopsies that\nare done as part of infertility testing, a pregnancy test isalso often performed before the procedure. Since thebiopsy is performed late in the menstrual cycle, it is pos-sible that the woman may be pregnant.\nAftercare\nThe biopsy may cause a small amount of bleeding\n(spotting). The woman can resume normal activities rightaway. If cramping becomes severe, heavy bleedingoccurs, or the woman develops a high temperature, thedoctor should be notified immediately.\nIf the test is being done to determine the cause of\ninfertility, the onset of the menstrual period following thebiopsy should be reported to the doctor. This will allowthe doctor to correctly predict if the endometrium hasbeen developing at the expected rate.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1186Endometrial biopsyKEY TERMS\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and microscopic\nexamination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.\nCervix —The opening of the uterus extending into\nthe vagina.\nEndometrium —The layer lining the inner cavity of\nthe uterus; this layer changes daily throughout themenstrual cycle.\nUterus —The hollow, muscular female organ that\nsupports the development and nourishment of theunborn baby during pregnancy.GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1186Risks\nThe risks of an endometrial biopsy are very small.\nThere is a possibility that prolonged bleeding may occurafter the procedure. There is also a slight chance of aninfection. Very rarely, there are instances when the uterusis pierced (perforated) or the cervix is torn because of thebiopsy.\nNormal results\nMost biopsies are done to rule out endometrial cancer\nor endometrial hyperplasia. A normal result shows no can-cerous or precancerous cells. Normal results also showthat the uterine lining is changing at the proper rate. If it is,then the results of the biopsy are said to be “in-phase”because the tissue looks appropriate and has developednormally for the late phase of the menstrual cycle.\nAbnormal results\nIf the endometrium is not developing at the appro-\npriate rate, the results are said to be “out-of-phase” orabnormal. The endometrium has not developed appropri-ately and cannot support a pregnancy. This condition iscalled luteal phase defect and may need to be treated\nwith progesterone.\nAbnormal appearance of the cells forming the uter-\nine tissue could also indicate uterine cancer, or the pres-ence of fibroids or polyps in the uterus.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. 16th ed.

Approximate-ly 34,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancereach year. In 1998, approximately 6,300 women diedfrom this cancer. Although endometrial cancer generallyoccurs in women who have gone through menopause\nand are 45 years of age or older, 30% of the women withendometrial cancer are younger than 40 years of age. Theaverage age at diagnosis is 60 years old.\nThe uterus, or womb, is the hollow female organ that\nsupports the development of the unborn baby duringpregnancy . The uterus has a thick muscular wall and an\ninner lining called the endometrium. The endometrium isvery sensitive to hormones and it changes daily duringthe menstrual cycle. The endometrium is designed toprovide an ideal environment for the fertilized egg toimplant and begin to grow. If pregnancy does not occur,the endometrium is shed causing the menstrual period.\nMore than 95% of uterine cancers arise in the\nendometrium. The most common type of uterine canceris adenocarcinoma. It arises from an abnormal multipli-cation of endometrial cells (atypical adenomatous hyper-plasia) and is made up of mature, specialized cells (well-differentiated). Less commonly, endometrial cancer aris-es without a preceding hyperplasia and is made up ofpoorly differentiated cells. The more common of thesetypes are the papillary serous and clear cell carcinomas.Poorly differentiated endometrial cancers are often asso-ciated with a less promising prognosis.\nThe highest incidence of endometrial cancer in the\nUnited States is in Caucasians, Hawaiians, Japanese, andAfrican Americans. American Indians, Koreans, andVietnamese have the lowest incidence. African Americanand Hawaiian women are more likely to be diagnosedwith advanced cancer and, therefore, have a higher riskof dying from the disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough the exact cause of endometrial cancer is\nunknown, it is clear that high levels of estrogen, whennot balanced by progesterone, can lead to abnormalgrowth of the endometrium. Factors that increase awoman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer are:\n• Age. The risk is considerably higher in women who are\nover the age of 50 and have gone through menopause.\n•Obesity . Being overweight is a very strong risk factor\nfor this cancer. Fatty tissue can change other normalbody chemicals into estrogen, which can promoteendometrial cancer.\n• Estrogen replacement therapy. Women receiving estro-\ngen supplements after menopause have a 12 times high-er risk of getting endometrial cancer if progesterone isnot taken simultaneously.\n• Diabetes. Diabetics have twice the risk of getting this\ncancer as nondiabetic women. It is not clear if this riskis due to the fact that many diabetics are also obese andhypertensive. One 1998 study found that women whowere obese and diabetic were three times more likely todevelop endometrial cancer than women who wereobese but nondiabetic. This study also found thatnonobese diabetics were not at risk of developingendometrial cancer.\n•Hypertension . High blood pressure (or hypertension)\nis also considered a risk factor for uterine cancer.\n• Irregular menstrual periods. During the menstrual\ncycle, there is interaction between the hormones estro-gen and progesterone. Women who do not ovulate regu-larly are exposed to high estrogen levels for longer peri-ods of time. If a woman does not ovulate regularly, thisdelicate balance is upset and may increase her chancesof getting uterine cancer.\n• Early first menstruation or late menopause. Having\nthe first period at a young age (the mean age ofmenses is 12.16 years in African American girls and12.88 years in caucasian girls) or going throughmenopause at a late age (over age 51) seem to putwomen at a slightly higher risk for developingendometrial cancer.\n• Tamoxifen. This drug, which is used to treat or prevent\nbreast cancer , increases a woman’s chance of develop-\ning endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen users tend to havemore advanced endometrial cancer with an associatedpoorer survival rate than those who do not take thedrug. In many cases, however, the value of tamoxifenfor treating breast cancer and for preventing the cancerfrom spreading far outweighs the small risk of gettingendometrial cancer.\n• Family history. Some studies suggest that endometrial\ncancer runs in certain families. Women with inheritedmutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are at ahigher risk of developing breast, ovarian, and othergynecologic cancers. Those with the hereditary non-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1188Endometrial cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1188polyposis colorectal cancer gene have a higher risk of\ndeveloping endometrial cancer.\n• Breast, ovarian, or colon cancer . Women who have a\nhistory of these other types of cancer are at an increasedrisk of developing endometrial cancer.\n• Low parity or nulliparity. Endometrial cancer is more\ncommon in women who have born few (low parity) orno (nulliparity) children. The high levels of proges-terone produced during pregnancy has a protectiveeffect against endometrial cancer. The results of onestudy suggest that nulliparity is associated with a lowersurvival rate.\n• Infertility. Risk is increased due to nulliparity or the use\nof fertility drugs.\n• Polycystic ovary syndrome. The increased level of\nestrogen associated with this abnormality raises the riskof cancers of the breast and endometrium.\nThe most common symptom of endometrial cancer\nis unusual vaginal spotting, bleeding, or discharge. Inwomen who are near menopause (perimenopausal),symptoms of endometrial cancer could include bleedingbetween periods (intermenstrual bleeding), heavy bleed-ing that lasts for more than seven days, or short menstru-al cycles (fewer than 21 days). For women who havegone through menopause, any vaginal bleeding or abnor-\nmal discharge is suspect. Pain in the pelvic region and\nthe presence of a lump (mass) are symptoms that occurlate in the disease.\nDiagnosis\nIf endometrial cancer is suspected, a series of tests\nwill be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. The firststep will involve taking a complete personal and familymedical history. A physical examination , which will\ninclude a thorough pelvic examination, will also bedone.\nThe doctor may order an endometrial biopsy . This\nis generally performed in the doctor’s office and does notrequire anesthesia. A thin, flexible tube is insertedthrough the cervix and into the uterus. A small piece ofendometrial tissue is removed. The patient may experi-ence some discomfort, which can be minimized by tak-ing an anti-inflammatory medication (like Advil orMotrin) an hour before the procedure.\nIf an adequate amount of tissue was not obtained by\nthe endometrial biopsy, or if the biopsy tissue looksabnormal but confirmation is needed, the doctor may per-form a dilatation and curettage (D & C). This procedure\nis done in the outpatient surgery department of a hospital\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1189Endometrial cancer\nCancer located in the uterus. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1189and takes about an hour. The patient may be given general\nanesthesia. The doctor dilates the cervix and uses a spe-cial instrument to scrape tissue from inside the uterus.\nThe tissue that is obtained from the biopsy or the D &\nC is sent to a laboratory for examination. If cancer is found,then the type of cancer will be determined. The treatmentand prognosis depends on the type and stage of the cancer.\nTrans-vaginal ultrasound may be used to measure the\nthickness of the endometrium. For this painless procedure,a wand-like ultrasound transducer is inserted into the vagi-na to enable visualization and measurement of the uterus,the thickness of the uterine lining, and other pelvic organs.\nOther possible diagnostic procedures include sono-\nhysterography and hysteroscopy . For sonohysteroscopy,\na small tube is passed through the cervix and into theuterus. A small amount of a salt water (saline) solution isinjected through the tube to open the space within theuterus and allow ultrasound visualization of theendometrium. For hysteroscopy, a wand-like camera ispassed through the cervix to allow direct visualization ofthe endometrium. Both of these procedures cause dis-comfort, which may be reduced by taking an anti-inflam-matory medication prior to the procedure.\nTreatment\nClinical staging\nThe International Federation of Gynecology and\nObstetrics (FIGO) has adopted a staging system forKEY TERMS\nAdjuvant therapy —A treatment done when there is\nno evidence of residual cancer in order to aid theprimary treatment.

The stage of cancer is determined after\nsurgery. Endometrial cancer is categorized into four stages(I, II, III, and IV) that are subdivided (A, B, and possibly C)based on the depth or spread of cancerous tissue. Seventypercent of all uterine cancers are stage I, 10–15% are stageII, and the remainder are stages III and IV . The cancer isalso graded (G1, G2, and G3) based upon microscopicanalysis of the aggressiveness of the cancer cells.\nThe FIGO stages for endometrial cancer are:\n• Stage I. Cancer is limited to the uterus.\n• Stage II. Cancer involves the uterus and cervix.\n• Stage III. Cancer has spread out of the uterus but is\nrestricted to the pelvic region.\n• Stage IV . Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, or\nother distant locations.\nThe mainstay of treatment for most stages of\nendometrial cancer is surgery. Radiation therapy , hor-\nmonal therapy, and chemotherapy are additional treat-\nments (called adjuvant therapy). The necessity of adju-vant therapy is a controversial topic which should be dis-cussed with the patient’s treatment team.\nSurgery\nMost women with endometrial cancer, except those\nwith stage IV disease, are treated with a hysterectomy . A\nsimple hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus.In a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with total hys-\nterectomy, the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1190Endometrial cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1190removed. This may be necessary because endometrial\ncancer often spreads to the ovaries first. The lymph nodesin the pelvic region may also be biopsied or removed tocheck for metastasis. Hysterectomy is traditionally per-formed through an incision in the abdomen (laparotomy),however, endoscopic surgery ( laparoscopy ) with vaginal\nhysterectomy is also being used. Women with stage I dis-ease may require no further treatment. However, thosewith higher grade disease will receive adjuvant therapy.\nRadiation therapy\nThe decision to use radiation therapy depends on the\nstage of the disease. Radiation therapy may be usedbefore surgery (preoperatively) and/or after surgery(postoperatively). Radiation given from a machine that isoutside the body is called external radiation therapy.Sometimes applicators containing radioactive com-pounds are placed inside the vagina or uterus. This iscalled internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy andrequires hospitalization.\nSide effects are common with radiation therapy. The\nskin in the treated area may become red and dry.Fatigue , upset stomach, diarrhea , and nausea are also\ncommon complaints. Radiation therapy in the pelvic areamay cause the vagina to become narrow (vaginal steno-sis), making intercourse painful. Premature menopause\nand some problems with urination may also occur.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is usually reserved for women with\nstage IV or recurrent disease because this therapy is not avery effective treatment for endometrial cancer. Theanticancer drugs are given by mouth or intravenously.\nSide effects include stomach upset, vomiting, appetiteloss, hair loss, mouth or vaginal sores, fatigue, menstrualcycle changes, and premature menopause. There is alsoan increased chance of infections.\nHormonal therapy\nHormonal therapy uses drugs like progesterone to\nslow the growth of endometrial cells. These drugs areusually available as pills. This therapy is usually reservedfor women with advanced or recurrent disease. Sideeffects include fatigue, fluid retention, and appetite andweight changes.\nAlternative treatment\nAlthough alternative and complementary therapies are\nused by many cancer patients, very few controlled studieson the effectiveness of such therapies exist. Mind-bodytechniques, such as prayer, biofeedback , visualization,\nmeditation , and yoga , have not shown any effect in reduc-ing cancer, but they can reduce stress and lessen some of\nthe side effects of cancer treatments. Clinical studies ofhydrazine sulfate found that it had no effect on cancer andeven worsened the health and well-being of the study sub-jects. One clinical study of the drug amygdalin (Laetrile)found that it had no effect on cancer. Laetrile can be toxicand has caused deaths. Shark cartilage, although highlytouted as an effective cancer treatment, is an improbabletherapy that has not been the subject of clinical study.\nThe American Cancer Society has found that the\n“metabolic diets” pose serious risk to the patient. Theeffectiveness of the macrobiotic, Gerson, and Kelley diets\nand the Manner metabolic therapy has not been scientifi-cally proven. The FDA was unable to substantiate the anti-cancer claims made about the popular Cancell treatment.\nThere is no evidence for the effectiveness of most\nover-the-counter herbal cancer remedies. Some herbalshave shown an anticancer effect. As shown in clinicalstudies, Polysaccharide krestin, from the mushroomCoriolus versicolor , has significant effectiveness against\ncancer. In a small study, the green alga Chlorella\npyrenoidosa has been shown to have anticancer activity.\nIn a few small studies, evening primrose oil has shownsome benefit in the treatment of cancer.\nPrognosis\nBecause it is possible to detect endometrial cancer\nearly, the chances of curing it are excellent. The five yearsurvival rates for endometrial cancer by stage are: 90%,stage I; 60%, stage II; 40%, stage III; and 5%, stage IV .Endometrial cancer most often spreads to the lungs, liver,bones, brain, vagina, and certain lymph nodes.\nPrevention\nWomen (especially postmenopausal women) should\nreport any abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge to thedoctor. Controlling obesity, blood pressure, and diabetescan help to reduce the risk of this disease. Women onestrogen replacement therapy have a substantiallyreduced risk of endometrial cancer if progestins are takensimultaneously. Long term use of birth control pills hasbeen shown to reduce the risk of this cancer. Women whohave irregular periods may be prescribed birth controlpills to help prevent endometrial cancer. Women who aretaking tamoxifen and those who carry the hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer gene should be screened reg-ularly, receiving annual pelvic examinations.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBruss, Katherine, Christina Salter, and Esmeralda Galan, eds.\nAmerican Cancer Society’s Guide to Complementary and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1191Endometrial cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1191Alternative Cancer Methods.

    "title": "Endometriosis",
    "content": "Endometriosis\nDefinition\nEndometriosis is a condition in which bits of the tis-\nsue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) growin other parts of the body. Like the uterine lining, this tis-sue builds up and sheds in response to monthly hormonalcycles. However, there is no natural outlet for the blooddiscarded from these implants. Instead, it falls onto sur-rounding organs, causing swelling and inflammation. Thisrepeated irritation leads to the development of scar tissueand adhesions in the area of the endometrial implants.\nDescription\nEndometriosis is estimated to affect 7% of women of\nchildbearing age in the United States. It most commonlystrikes between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis canalso appear in the teen years, but never before the start ofmenstruation. It is seldom seen in postmenopausalwomen.\nEndometriosis was once called the “career woman’s\ndisease” because it was thought to be a product ofdelayed childbearing. The statistics defy such a narrowgeneralization; however, pregnancy may slow the\nprogress of the condition. A more important predictor ofa woman’s risk is if her female relatives have endome-triosis. Another influencing factor is the length of awoman’s menstrual cycle. Women whose periods lastlonger than a week with an interval of less than 27 daysbetween them seem to be more prone to the condition.\nEndometrial implants are most often found on the\npelvic organs—the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and inthe cavity behind the uterus. Occasionally, this tissuegrows in such distant parts of the body as the lungs, arms,and kidneys. Newly formed implants appear as smallbumps on the surfaces of the organs and supporting liga-ments and are sometimes said to look like “powder burns.”Ovarian cysts may form around endometrial tissue\n(endometriomas) and may range from pea to grapefruitsize. Endometriosis is a progressive condition that usuallyadvances slowly, over the course of many years. Doctorsrank cases from minimal to severe based on factors such asthe number and size of the endometrial implants, theirappearance and location, and the extent of the scar tissueand adhesions in the vicinity of the growths.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough the exact cause of endometriosis is\nunknown, a number of theories have been put forward.Some of the more popular ones are:\n• Implantation theory. Originally proposed in the 1920s,\nthis theory states that a reversal in the direction of men-strual flow sends discarded endometrial cells into thebody cavity where they attach to internal organs andseed endometrial implants. There is considerable evi-dence to support this explanation. Reversed menstrual\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1192EndometriosisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1192flow occurs in 70–90% of women and is thought to be\nmore common in women with endometriosis. However,many women with reversed menstrual flow do notdevelop endometriosis.\n• Vascular-lymphatic theory. This theory suggests that\nthe lymph system or blood vessels (vascular system) isthe vehicle for the distribution of endometrial cells outof the uterus.\n• Coelomic metaplasia theory. According to this hypothe-\nsis, remnants of tissue left over from prenatal develop-ment of the woman’s reproductive tract transforms intoendometrial cells throughout the body.\n• Induction theory. This explanation postulates that an\nunidentified substance found in the body forces cellsfrom the lining of the body cavity to change intoendometrial cells.\nIn addition to these theories, the following factors are\nthought to influence the development of endometriosis:\n• Heredity. A woman’s chance of developing endometrio-\nsis is seven times greater if her mother or sisters havethe disease.\n• Immune system function. Women with endometriosis\nmay have lower functioning immune systems that havetrouble eliminating stray endometrial cells. This wouldexplain why a high percentage of women experiencereversed menstrual flow while relatively few developendometriosis.\n• Dioxin exposure. Some research suggests a link\nbetween the exposure to dioxin (TCCD), a toxic chemi-cal found in weed killers, and the development ofendometriosis.\nWhile many women with endometriosis suffer debil-\nitating symptoms, others have the disease without know-ing it. Paradoxically, there does not seem to be any rela-tion between the severity of the symptoms and the extentof the disease. The most common symptoms are:\n• Menstrual pain . Pain in the lower abdomen that begins\na day or two before the menstrual period starts and con-tinues through to the end is typical of endometriosis.Some women also report lower back aches and painduring urination and bowel movement, especially dur-ing their periods.\n• Painful sexual intercourse. Pressure on the vagina and\ncervix causes severe pain for some women.\n• Abnormal bleeding. Heavy menstrual periods, irregular\nbleeding, and spotting are common features ofendometriosis.\n•Infertility . There is a strong association between\nendometriosis and infertility, although the reasons forthis have not been fully explained. It is thought thatthe build up of scar tissue and adhesions blocks the\nfallopian tubes and prevents the ovaries from releasingeggs. Endometriosis may also affect fertility by caus-ing hormonal irregularities and a higher rate of earlymiscarriage .\nDiagnosis\nIf a doctor suspects endometriosis, the first step will\nbe to perform a pelvic exam to try to feel if implants are\npresent. Very often there is no strong evidence ofendometriosis from a physical exam. The only way tomake a definitive diagnosis is through minor surgerycalled a laparoscopy . A laparoscope, a slender scope with\na light on the end, is inserted into the woman’s abdomenthrough a small incision near her belly button. This allowsthe doctor to examine the internal organs for endometrioticgrowths. Often, a sample of tissue is taken for later exami-nation in the laboratory. Endometriosis is sometimes dis-covered when a woman has abdominal surgery for anotherreason such as tubal ligation or hysterectomy .\nVarious imaging techniques such as ultrasound,\ncomputed tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic res-\nonance imaging (MRI) can offer additional information\nbut aren’t useful in making the initial diagnosis. A bloodtest may also be ordered because women withendometriosis have higher levels of the blood proteinCA125. Testing for this substance before and after treat-ment can predict a recurrence of the disease, but the testis not reliable as a diagnostic tool.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1193Endometriosis\nAn endoscopic view of endometriosis on pelvic wall. (Cus-\ntom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1193Treatment\nHow endometriosis is treated depends on the\nwoman’s symptoms, her age, the extent of the disease,and her personal preferences. The condition cannot befully eradicated without surgery. Conservative treatmentfocuses on managing the pain, preserving fertility, anddelaying the progress of the condition.\nPain relief\nOver-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin\nand acetaminophen (Tylenol) are useful for mild\ncramping and menstrual pain. Prescription-strengthand over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\nand naproxen (Naprosyn), are also effective. If pain issevere, a doctor may prescribe narcotic medications,although these can be addicting and are rarely used.\nHormonal treatments\nHormonal therapies effectively tame endometriosis\nbut also act as contraceptives. A woman who is hoping tobecome pregnant would take these medications for aperiod of time, then try to conceive within severalmonths of discontinuing treatment.\n• Oral contraceptives. Continuously taking estrogen-\nprogestin pills tricks the body into thinking it is preg-nant. This state of pseudopregnancy means reducedpelvic pain and a temporary withering of endometrialimplants.\n• Danazol (Danocrine) and gestrinone are synthetic male\nhormones that lower estrogen levels, prevent menstrua-tion, and shrink endometrial tissues. On the downside,they lead to weight gain and menopause-like symp-toms, and cause some women to develop masculinecharacteristics.\n• Progestins. Medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) and\nrelated drugs may also be used in treating endometrio-sis. They have been proven effective in minimizing painand halting the progress of the condition, but are rarelyused because of the high rate of side effects.\n• Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnHR) agonists.\nThese estrogen-inhibiting drugs successfully limit painand prevent the growth of endometrial implants. Theycan cause menopause symptoms, however, and doses\nhave to be regulated to prevent bone loss associatedwith low estrogen levels.\nSurgery\nRemoving the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes is\nthe only permanent method of eliminating endometrio-sis. This is an extreme measure that deprives a woman ofher ability to bear children and forces her body into\nmenopause. Endometrial implants and ovarian cysts canbe removed with laser surgery performed through a\nlaparoscope. For women with minimal endometriosis,this technique is usually successful in reducing pain andslowing the condition’s progress. It may also help infer-tile women increase their chances of becoming pregnant.\nAlternative treatment\nAlthough severe endometriosis should not be self-\ntreated, many women find they can help their conditionthrough alternative therapies. Taking vitamin B complexcombined with vitamins C, E, and the minerals calcium,\nmagnesium, and selenium can help the depression andlack of energy that may accompany endometriosis. B vit-amins also counteract the side effects of hormonal drugs.Other women have found relief when they turned to amacrobiotic diet. Less extreme diets that cut out sugar,\nsalt, and processed foods are sometimes helpful as well.Mind-body therapies such as relaxation and visualizationhelp women cope with pain. Other avenues to combatpain include acupuncture and biofeedback techniques.\nStill other women report positive results after being treat-ed by chiropractors or homeopathic doctors.\nPrognosis\nMost women who have endometriosis have minimal\nsymptoms and do well. Overall, endometriosis symp-toms come back in an average of 40% of women over thefive years following treatment. With hormonal therapy,pain returned after five years in 37% of patients withminimal symptoms and 74% of those with severe cases.The highest success rate from conservative treatment fol-lowed complete removal of implants using laser surgery.Eighty percent of these women were still pain-free fiveyears later. In cases that don’t respond to these treat-ments, a woman and her doctor may consider surgery toremove her reproductive organs.\nPrevention\nThere is no proven way to prevent endometriosis.\nOne study, however, indicated that girls who begin par-ticipating in aerobic exercise at a young age are less like-\nly to develop the condition.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBreitkopf, Lyle J.

ERUS can also be used in cases of anal fistula(an abnormal passage) and problems with the analsphincter muscles (muscles that control the opening andclosing of the anus).\nPrecautions\nNormal precautions should be taken with any diag-\nnostic procedure. Since the population in which this pro-cedure is normally done is elderly, the imaging staffshould be extra cautious about stressing the patient. Theprocedure is invasive and may be embarrassing to some.Other patients may be anxious about their medical condi-tion since endorectal ultrasounds are not routine. Thisplaces an added burden on already stressed hearts andnervous systems. Physicians, nurses, and techniciansmay need to be prepared for stress reactions that could\ninclude the heart, asthma , or anxious behaviors.\nDescription\nERUS has been used as a means to determine the\ndepth of rectal cancers and to assess whether the tumorhas affected surrounding tissues. This pre-treatment pro-cedure has proven to be an accurate tool for tailoringsurgery for patients.\nProblems with interpretation of the sonograms after\nradiation and before surgery have resulted in tumorsbeing identified that were merely the formation offibrous tissues that remained after the tumors had beeneliminated by the radiation. Yet, some of the fibrousareas actually hid residual tumors. Rectal anatomy itselfcan affect the accuracy of ultrasound reading. Thismakes ERUS problematic in determining the amount oftumor reduction a patient has after radiation therapy .\nPreparation\nThe patient must evacuate the bowels completely\nbefore the procedure is done. This usually is assistedthough the use of several enemas . The patient may be\ntold to adhere to a liquid diet the day prior to doing thisprocedure.

Franz\nEndoscopic retrograde\ncholangiopancreatography\nDefinition\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n(ERCP) is a technique in which a hollow tube called anendoscope is passed through the mouth and stomach tothe duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Thisprocedure was developed to examine abnormalities ofthe bile ducts, pancreas, and gallbladder. It was devel-oped during the late 1960s and is used today to diagnoseand treat blockages of the bile and pancreatic ducts.\nThe term has three parts to its definition:\n• endoscopic refers to the use of an endoscope• retrograde refers to the injection of dye up into the bile\nducts in a direction opposing, or against, the normalflow of bile down the ducts\n• cholangiopancreatography means visualization of the\nbile ducts (cholangio) and pancreas (pancreato)\nPurpose\nUntil the 1970s, methods to visualize the bile ducts\nproduced images that were of relatively poor quality andoften misleading; in addition, the pancreatic duct couldnot be examined at all. Patients with symptoms related tothe bile ducts or pancreatic ducts frequently neededsurgery to diagnose and treat their conditions.\nUsing ERCP, physicians can obtain high-quality x\nrays of these structures and identify areas of narrowing(strictures), cancers, and gallstones . This procedure can\nhelp determine whether bile or pancreatic ducts areblocked; it also identifies where they are blocked alongwith the cause of the blockage. ERCP may then be usedto relieve the blockage. For patients requiring surgery oradditional procedures for treatment, ERCP outlines theanatomical changes for the surgeon.\nPrecautions\nThe most important precaution is that the examina-\ntion should be performed by an experienced physician.The procedure is much more technically difficult thanmany other gastrointestinal endoscopic studies. Patients\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1196Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1196should seek physicians with experience performing\nERCP. Patients should inform the physician about anyallergies (including allergies to contrast dyes, iodine, or\nshellfish), medication use, and medical problems. Occa-sionally, patients may need to be admitted to the hospitalafter the procedure.\nDescription\nAfter sedation , a specially adapted endoscope is\npassed through the mouth, through the stomach, then intothe duodenum. The opening to ducts that empty from theliver and pancreas is identified, and a plastic tube orcatheter is placed into the orifice (opening). Contrast dyeis then injected into the ducts, and with the assistance ofa radiologist, pictures are taken.\nPreparation\nThe upper intestinal tract must be empty for the pro-\ncedure, so patients should not eat or drink for at least six to12 hours before the exam. Patients should ask the physi-cian about taking their medications before the procedure.\nAftercare\nSomeone should be available to take the person\nhome after the procedure and stay with them for a while;patients will not be able to drive themselves because theyundergo sedation during this test. Pain or any other\nunusual symptoms should be reported to the physician.\nRisks\nERCP-related complications can be broken down\ninto those related to medications used during the proce-dure, the diagnostic part of the procedure, and thoserelated to endoscopic therapy. The overall complicationrate is 5–10%; most of those occur when diagnosticERCP is combined with a therapeutic procedure. Duringthe exam, the endoscopist can cut or stretch structures(such as the muscle leading to the bile duct) to treat thecause of the patient’s symptoms. Although the use ofsedatives carries a risk of decreasing cardiac and respira-tory function, it is very difficult to perform these proce-dures without these drugs.\nThe major complications related to diagnostic ERCP\nare pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and\ncholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Bacteremia\n(the passage of bacteria into the blood stream) and perfo-ration (hole in the intestinal tract) are additional risks.\nNormal results\nBecause certain standards have been set for the nor-\nmal diameter or width of the pancreatic duct and bileKEY TERMS\nEndoscope, endoscopy —An endoscope used in the\nfield of gastroenterology is a hollow, thin, flexibletube that uses a lens or miniature camera to viewvarious areas of the gastrointestinal tract.

The ducts and gallbladder should be free of stonesor tumors.\nAbnormal results\nWhen areas in the pancreatic or bile ducts (including\nthose in the liver) are too wide or too narrow comparedwith the standard, the test is considered abnormal. Oncethese findings are demonstrated using ERCP, symptomsare usually present; they generally do not change withouttreatment. Stones, identified as opaque or solid structureswithin the ducts, are also considered abnormal. Massesor tumors may also be seen, but sometimes the diagnosisis made not by direct visualization of the tumor, but byindirect signs, such as a single narrowing of one of theducts. Overall, ERCP has an excellent record in diagnos-ing these abnormalities.\nResources\nBOOKS\nOstroff, James W., and Jeanne M.

The procedurewas developed as an extension to the diagnostic examina-tion, ERCP ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-\natography ); with the addition of “sphincterotomy,”\nabnormalities found during the study could be treated atthe same time without the need for invasive surgery.\nThe term ERS has three parts to its definition;\n• endoscopic refers to the use of an endoscope\n• retrograde refers to the insertion of the endoscope up\ninto the ducts in a direction opposite to or against thenormal flow of bile down the ducts\n• sphincterotomy, which means cutting of the sphincter\nor muscle that lies at the juncture of the intestine withboth the bile and pancreatic ducts\nPurpose\nUntil the 1970s, patients with symptoms related to\ndisease of the bile ducts or pancreas frequently neededsurgery to diagnose the cause and treat any abnormali-ties. ERCP allowed physicians for the first time to obtainhigh quality x rays of the common bile and pancreaticducts, and detect areas of narrowing (strictures), stones,and tumors. ERCP was not initially designed for treat-ment. ERS was developed shortly after and enabledphysicians to treat the abnormalities identified by theinjection of dye and x rays.The revolutionary technique made possible the\nendoscopic removal of stones and stretching of areas ofnarrowing (strictures). It has since been expanded toinclude drainage of bile from blocked ducts and treat-ment of various abnormalities of the pancreas.\nPrecautions\nThe most important precaution related to both ERCP\nand ERS is to have the procedure performed by an expe-rienced physician. ERS is technically more difficult thanmany other gastrointestinal endoscopic studies, includingERCP. Patients should inquire as to the physician’s expe-rience with the procedure. The physician should also beinformed of any allergies , medication use, and medical\nproblems.\nDescription\nERS is generally performed only after ERCP has\nbeen successfully accomplished and detail of the anato-my and abnormalities is known. During ERS, a numberof various instruments are inserted through the endo-scope in order to “cut” or stretch the sphincter. Once thisis done, additional instruments are passed that enable theremoval of stones and the stretching of narrowed regionsof the ducts. Drains (stents) can also be used to prevent anarrowed area from rapidly returning to its previouslynarrowed state.\nPreparation\nThe upper intestinal tract must be empty for the pro-\ncedure, so patients must not eat or drink for at least six to12 hours before the exam. Patients need to inquire abouttaking their medications before the procedure. Somepatients may require antibiotics before and/or after the\nprocedure. When possible, aspirin or NSAIDS should\nnot be taken within several days before the procedure,because they interfere with blood clotting.\nAftercare\nWhen ERS is performed, physicians will usually\nwant to observe the patient closely for several hours toensure that there are no signs of complications. Pain or\nany other unusual symptoms should be reported. Admis-sion to the hospital may be advised.\nRisks\nERS complications are related either to the drugs\nused during the procedure, or the results of dye injectionor cutting of tissue.

Tap water is commonly used for adults butshould not be used for infants because of the danger ofelectrolyte (substance that conducts electric currentwithin the body and is essential for sustaining life)imbalance. The colon absorbs water, and repeated tap\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1199EnemasGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1199water enemas can cause cardiovascular overload and\nelectrolyte imbalance. Similarly, repeated saline enemascan cause increased absorption of fluid and electrolytesinto the bloodstream, resulting in overload. Individualsreceiving frequent enemas should be observed for over-load symptoms that include dizziness , sweating, or\nvomiting.\nSoap suds and saline used for cleansing enemas can\ncause irritation of the lining of the bowel, with repeateduse or a solution that is too strong. Only white soapshould be used; the bar should not have been previouslyused, to prevent infusing undesirable organisms into theindividual receiving the enema. Common householddetergents are considered too strong for the rectum andbowel. The commercially prepared castile soap is pre-ferred, and should be used in concentration no greaterthan 5 cc soap to 1,000 cc of water.\nDescription\nCleansing enemas act by stimulation of bowel activ-\nity through irritation of the lower bowel, and by disten-tion with the volume of fluid instilled. When the enemais administered, the individual is usually lying on the leftside, which places the sigmoid colon (lower portion ofbowel) below the rectum and facilitates infusion of fluid.The length of time it takes to administer an enemadepends on the amount of fluid to be infused. Theamount of fluid administered will vary depending on theage and size of the person receiving the enema, however\ngeneral guidelines would be:\n• Infant: 250 cc or less\n• Toddler and preschooler: 500 cc or less\n• School-aged child: 500–1,000 cc• Adult: 750–1,000 cc\nSome may differentiate between high and low ene-\nmas. A high enema, given to cleanse as much of the largebowel as possible, is usually administered at higher pres-sure and with larger volume (1,000 cc), and the individ-ual changes position several times in order for the fluidto flow up into the bowel. A low enema, intended tocleanse only the lower bowel, is administered at lowerpressure, using about 500 cc of fluid.\nOil retention enemas serve to lubricate the rectum\nand lower bowel, and soften the stool. For adults, about150–200 cc of oil is instilled, while in small children,75–150 cc of oil is considered adequate. Salad oil or liq-uid petrolatum are commonly used at a temperature of91°F (32.8°C). There are also commercially prepared oilretention enemas. The oil is usually retained for one tothree hours before it is expelled.\nThe rectal tube used for infusion of the solution,\nusually made of rubber or plastic, has two or moreopenings at the end through which the solution can flowinto the bowel. The distance to which the tube must beinserted is dependent upon the age and size of thepatient. For adult, insertion is usually 3–4 in (7.5–10cm); for children, approximately 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm); andfor infants, only 1–1.5 in (2.5–3.75 cm). The rectal tubeis lubricated before insertion with a water soluble lubri-cant to ease insertion and decrease irritation to the rec-tal tissues.\nThe higher the container of solution is placed, the\ngreater the force in which the fluid flows into the patient.Routinely, the container should be no higher than 12 in(30 cm) above the level of the bed; for a high cleansingenema, the container may be 12–18 in (30–45 cm) abovethe bed level, because the fluid is to be instilled higherinto the bowel.\nPreparation\nThe solution used in the procedure is measured,\nmixed, and warmed before administration of the enema.\nAftercare\nIf necessary, a specimen will be collected for diag-\nnostic evaluation.

The small intestine is about 20 ft (6.1 m) longand the large intestine, about 5 ft (1.5 m) long.\nRectum —The portion of bowel just before the anus.\nThe prefix recto is used with a variety of words in\nrelation to conditions that affect the rectum.more difficult by narrowing the urethra, a tube running\nfrom the bladder through the prostate gland. It can beeffectively treated by surgery and, today, by certaindrugs.\nDescription\nThe common term for enlarged prostate is BPH,\nwhich stands for benign (non-cancerous) prostatichyperplasia or hypertrophy. Hyperplasia means that theprostate cells are dividing too rapidly, increasing thetotal number of cells, and, therefore, the size of theorgan itself. Hypertrophy simply means “enlargement.”BPH is part of the aging process. The actual changes in\nthe prostate may start as early as the 30s but take placevery gradually, so that significant enlargement andsymptoms usually do not appear until after age 50. Pastthis age the chances of the prostate enlarging and caus-ing urinary symptoms become progressively greater.More than 40% of men in their 70s have an enlargedprostate. Symptoms generally appear between ages55–75. About 10% of all men eventually will requiretreatment for BPH.\nBPH has been viewed as a rare condition in African,\nChinese and other Asian peoples for reasons that are notclear.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of BPH is a mystery, but age-related\nchanges in the levels of hormones circulating in theblood may be a factor. Whatever the cause, an enlargingprostate gradually narrows the urethra and obstructs theflow of urine. Even though the muscle in the bladder wallbecomes stronger in an attempt to push urine through thesmaller urethra, in time, the bladder fails to empty com-pletely at each urination. The urine that collects in thebladder can become infected and lead to stone formation.The kidneys themselves may be damaged by infection orby urine constantly “backing up.”\nWhen the enlarging prostate gland narrows the ure-\nthra, a man will have increasing trouble starting the urinestream. Because some urine remains behind in the blad-der, he will have to urinate more often, perhaps two orthree times at night (nocturia). The need to urinate canbecome very urgent and, in time, urine may dribble outto stain a man’s clothing. Other symptoms of BPH are aweak and sometimes a split stream and general aching orpain in the perineum (the area between the scrotum and\nanus). Some men may have considerable enlargement ofthe prostate before even mild symptoms develop.\nIf a man must strain hard to force out the urine,\nsmall veins in the bladder wall and urethra may rupture,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1201Enlarged prostateGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1201causing blood to appear in the urine. If the urinary stream\nbecomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad-der may cause severe discomfort, a condition calledacute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad-der can easily become infected. A burning feeling duringurination and fever are clues that infection may have\ndeveloped. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it mayincrease pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus-es permanent kidney damage.\nDiagnosis\nWhen a man’s symptoms point to BPH, the first\nthing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal\nexamination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel\nwhether—and how much—the prostate is enlarged. Asmooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis-tinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer .\nThe next step is a blood test for a substance calledprostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30–50% ofmen with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This doesnot mean cancer by any means, but other measures\nare needed to make sure that the prostate enlargementis in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate,which is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, canshow whether it is enlarged and may show that canceris present.If digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate\nraises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec-ommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. Thisis usually done using a lance-like instrument that isinserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and,guided by the physcian’s finger, obtains six to eightpieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratoryfor microscopic examination. If cancer is present, theprognosis and treatment are changed accordingly.\nA catheter placed through the urethra and into the\nbladder can show how much urine remains in the bladderafter the patient urinates—a measure of how severe theobstruction is. Another and very simple test for obstruc-tion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter,which measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain—though invasive—way of confirming obstruction from anenlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrumentcalled a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not oftennecessary.\nIt is routine to check a urine sample for an increased\nnumber of white blood cells, which may mean there isinfection of the bladder or kidneys. The same samplemay be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus-ing the infection, and which antibiotics will work best.\nThe state of the kidneys may be checked in two ways:imaging by either ultrasound or injecting a dye (the intra-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1202Enlarged prostateEnlarged \nprostateglandUreter\nProstate\nglandUrine retention in bladder\nConstricted\nurethra\nNormal sized prostate gland Enlarged prostate gland\nAn enlarged prostate is a non-cancerous condition in which the narrowing of the urethra makes the elimination of urine more\ndifficult.

These drugs improve obstructive symptoms, but donot keep the prostate from enlarging. Other drugs (finas-teride is a good example) do shrink the prostate and maydelay the need for surgery. Symptoms may not, however,improve until the drug has been used for three months orlonger. Antibiotic drugs are given promptly wheneverinfection is diagnosed. Some medications, including anti-\nhistamines and some decongestants , can make the\nsymptoms of BPH suddenly worse and even cause acuteurinary retention, and therefore should be avoided.\nIntermediate treatments\nWhen drugs have failed to control symptoms of\nBPH but the physician does not believe that conventionalsurgery is yet needed, a procedure called transurethralneedle ablation may be tried. In the office and using localanesthesia, a needle is inserted into the prostate andradiofrequency energy is applied to destroy the tissuethat is obstructing urine flow. Another new approach ismicrowave hyperthermia, using a device called theProstatron to deliver microwave energy to the prostatethrough a catheter. This procedure is done at an outpa-tient surgery center.\nSurgery\nFor many years the standard operation for BPH has\nbeen transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Undergeneral or spinal anesthesia, a cystoscope is passedthrough the urethra and prostate tissue surrounding theurethra is removed using either a cutting instrument or aheated wire loop. The small pieces of prostate tissue arewashed out through the scope. No incision is needed forTUR. There normally is some blood in the urine for afew days following the procedure. In a few men—lessthan 5% of all those having TUR—urine will continue toescape unintentionally. Other uncommon complicationsinclude a temporary rise in blood pressure with mentalconfusion, which is treated by giving salt solution. Impo-tence—the inability to achieve lasting penile erections—does occur, but probably in fewer than 10% of patients. Anarrowing or stricture rarely develops in the urethra, butthis can be treated fairly easily.KEY TERMS\nCatheter —A rubber or plastic tube placed through\nthe urethra into the bladder to remove excessurine when the flow of urine is cut off, or to pre-vent urinary infection.\nCreatinine —One of the “waste” substances nor-\nmally excreted by the kidneys into the urine.When urine flow is slowed, creatinine may collectin the blood and cause toxic effects.\nHyperplasia —A condition where cells, such as\nthose making up the prostate gland, rapidly divideabnormally and cause the organ to becomeenlarged.\nHypertrophy —A technical term for enlargement,\nas in BPH (benign prostatic hypertrophy).\nUrethra —In males, the tube that conducts urine\nfrom the bladder through the penis to the outsideof the body. When narrowed by an enlargingprostate, symptoms of BPH develop.\nUrinary retention —The result of progressive\nobstruction of the urethra by an enlarging prostate,causing urine to remain in the bladder even afterurination.\nAlternatives to TUR, some only recently introduced,\ninclude:\n• Laser ablation of the prostate. Laser energy is applied\nto the prostate through a special fiber passed through acystoscope. The procedure is done in an operatingroom, and several patients have retained urine postoper-atively.\n• Transurethral incision of the prostate. Less invasive\nthan standard TUR, an incision is made through theprostate to open up the part of the urethra passingthrough it. This may work well in men whose prostateis not grossly enlarged.\n• Transurethral vaporization. A small roller ball is used to\nbreak up and vaporize the obstructing prostatic tissue,rather than cutting it away as in standard TUR. This isequally successful but patients usually can leave thehospital within 24 hours, and there is less blood loss.\n• If the prostate is greatly enlarged—as is the case in\nabout 5–10% of those diagnosed, an incision is made toperform an open prostatectomy , removing the entire\ngland under direct vision.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1203Enlarged prostateGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1203Alternative treatment\nAn extract of the saw palmetto (Serenoa repens or\nS. serrulata ) has been shown to stop or decrease the\nhyperplasia of the prostate. Symptoms of BPH willimprove after taking the herb for one to two months, butcontinued use is recommended.\nPrognosis\nIn a man without symptoms whose prostate is\nenlarged, it is hard to predict when urinary symptomswill develop and how rapidly they will progress. For thisreasons some specialists (urologists) advise a period of“watchful waiting.” When BPH is treated by convention-al TUR, there is a small risk of complications but, in thegreat majority of men, urinary symptoms will be relievedand their quality of life will be much enhanced. In thefuture, it is possible that the less invasive forms of surgi-cal treatment will be increasingly used to achieve resultsas good as those of the standard operation. It also is pos-sible that new medications will be developed that shrinkthe prostate and eliminate obstructive symptoms so thatsurgery can be avoided altogether.\nPrevention\nWhether or not BPH is caused by hormonal changes\nin aging men, there is no known way of preventing it.Once it does develop and symptoms are present thatinterfere seriously with the patient’s life, timely medicalor surgical treatment will reliably prevent symptomsfrom getting worse. Also, if the condition is treatedbefore the prostate has become grossly enlarged, the riskof complications is minimal. One of the potentially mostserious complications of BPH, urinary infection (andpossible infection of the kidneys), can be prevented byusing a catheter to drain excess urine out of the bladderso that it does not collect, stagnate, and become infected.\nResources\nBOOKS\nRous, Stephen N.

    "title": "Enterobacterial infections",
    "content": "Enterobacterial infections\nDefinition\nEnterobacterial infections are disorders of the diges-\ntive tract and other organ systems produced by a group ofgram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria called Enterobacteri-aceae. Gram-negative means that the organisms do notretain the violet color of the dye used to make Gramstains. The most troublesome organism in this group isEscherichia coli . Other enterobacteria are species of Sal-\nmonella ,Shigella ,Klebsiella ,Enterobacter ,Serratia ,\nProteus , and Yersinia .\nDescription\nEnterobacterial infections can be produced by bacte-\nria that normally live in the human digestive tract withoutcausing serious disease, or by bacteria that enter from theoutside. In many cases these infections are nosocomial,which means that they can be acquired in the hospital.Klebsiella and Proteus sometimes cause pneumonia , ear\nand sinus infections, and urinary tract infections. Enter-\nobacter and Serratia often cause bacterial infection of\nthe blood ( bacteremia ), particularly in patients with\nweakened immune systems.\nDiarrhea caused by enterobacteria is a common\nproblem in the United States. It is estimated that eachperson in the general population has an average of 1.5episodes of diarrhea each year, with higher rates in chil-dren, institutionalized people, and Native Americans.This type of enterobacterial infection can range from aminor nuisance to a life-threatening disorder, especiallyin infants, elderly persons, AIDS patients, and malnour-\nished people. Enterobacterial infections are one of thetwo leading killers of children in developing countries.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nEnterobacterial infections in the digestive tract typi-\ncally start when the organisms invade the mucous tissuesthat line the digestive tract. They may be bacteria that are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1204Enterobacterial infectionsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1204already present in the stomach and intestines, or they\nmay be transmitted by contaminated food and water. It isalso possible for enterobacterial infections to spread byperson-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is12–72 hours.\nESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections\ncause most of the enterobacterial infections in the UnitedStates. The organisms are categorized according towhether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasivetypes of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic\nE. coli , or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli , or ETEC.\nEPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin)in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices andcauses the patient to lose large amounts of water throughthe intestines.\nThe invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor-\nrhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or\nEIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct-ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHECcan produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic\nsyndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by\nthe destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure.EHEC has become a growing problem in the UnitedStates because of outbreaks caused by contaminatedfood. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 hasbeen identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers,unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2–7% ofinfections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of enterobacterial infections are\nsometimes classified according to the type of diarrheathey produce.\nWATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC,\nEPEC, some types of Salmonella , and some types of\nShigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are\nlocated in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxinsinteracting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma-tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics .\nBLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea\nis sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC,EIEC, some types of Salmonella , some types of Shigella ,\nand Yersinia . In dysentery, the infection is located in the\ncolon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation ispresent, and antibiotic therapy is usually required.\nNECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing\nenterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn\ninfants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fullyunderstood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial orviral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The diseaseorganisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis-sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease\nof prematurity ; 60–80% of cases occur in high-risk\npreterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2–5% of cases innewborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceaethat have been identified in infants with NEC includeSalmonella ,E. coli ,Klebsiella , and Enterobacter .\nDiagnosis\nPatient history\nThe diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com-\nplicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and othertypes of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most casesof mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organismbecause the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups ofpatients, however, should have stool tests. They include:\n• patients with bloody diarrhea,• patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy-\ndrated,\n• patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than\nthree days without decreasing in amount,\n• patients with disorders of the immune system.\nThe patient history is useful for public health reasons\nas well as helping the doctor determine what type ofenterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctorwill ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar-rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient isnauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to belocated in the small intestine. If the patient is running afever , a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor\nwill also ask if anyone else in the patient’s family orworkplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae aremore likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Otherquestions include the patient’s food intake over the lastfew days and whether he or she has recently traveled tocountries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks.\nPhysical examination\nThe most important parts of the physical examina-\ntion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam-\nining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctorwill look at the inside of the patient’s mouth and evaluatethe skin for signs of dehydration . The presence of a skin\nrash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than abacterial infection. If the patient’s abdomen hurts when thedoctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely.\nLaboratory tests\nThe most common test that is used to identify the\ncause of diarrhea is the stool test. Examining a stool sam-ple under a microscope can help to rule out parasitic and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1205Enterobacterial infectionsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1205KEY TERMS\nDysentery —A type of diarrhea caused by infec-\ntion and characterized by mucus and blood in thestools.\nEmpirical treatment —Medical treatment that is\ngiven on the basis of the doctor’s observations andexperience.\nEscherichia coli —A type of enterobacterium that\nis responsible for most cases of severe bacterialdiarrhea in the United States.\nHemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) —A potential-\nly fatal complication of E. coli infections character-\nized by kidney failure and destruction of red bloodcells.\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) —A disorder in\nnewborns caused by bacterial or viral invasion ofvulnerable intestinal tissues.\nNosocomial infections —Infections acquired in\nhospitals.\nToxin —A poison produced by certain types of\nbacteria.protozoal infections. Routine stool cultures, however,\ncannot be used to identify any of the four types of E. coli\nthat cause intestinal infections. ETEC, EPEC, and EIECare unusual in the United States and can usually be iden-tified only by specialists in research laboratories.Because of concern about EHEC outbreaks, however,most laboratories in the United States can now screen forO157:H7 with a test that identifies its characteristictoxin. All patients with bloody diarrhea should have astool sample tested for E. coli O157:H7.\nTreatment\nThe initial treatment of enterobacterial diarrhea is\nusually empiric. Empiric means that the doctor treats thepatient on the basis of the visible symptoms and profes-sional experience in treating infections, without waitingfor laboratory test results. Since the results of stool cul-tures can take as long as two days, it is important to pre-vent dehydration. The patient will be given fluids torestore the electrolyte balance and paregoric to relieveabdominal cramping.\nNewborn infants and patients with immune system\ndisorders will be given antibiotics intravenously once theorganism has been identified. Gentamicin, tobramycin,and amikacin are being used more frequently to treatenterobacterial infections because many of the organismsare becoming resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporinantibiotics.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments for diarrhea are intended to\nrelieve the discomfort of abdominal cramping. Mostalternative practitioners advise consulting a medical doc-tor if the patient has sunken eyes, dry eyes or mouth, orother signs of dehydration.\nHerbal medicine\nHerbalists may recommend cloves taken as an infu-\nsion or ginger given in drop doses to control intestinalcramps, eliminate gas, and prevent vomiting. Peppermint(Mentha piperita ) or chamomile ( Matricaria recutita )\ntea may also ease cramps and intestinal spasms.\nHomeopathy\nHomeopathic practitioners frequently recommend\nArsenicum album for diarrhea caused by contaminated\nfood, and Belladonna for diarrhea that comes on sudden-\nly with mucus in the stools. Veratrum album would be\ngiven for watery diarrhea, and Podophyllum for diarrhea\nwith few other symptoms.Prognosis\nThe prognosis for most enterobacterial infections is\ngood; most patients recover in about a week or 10 dayswithout needing antibiotics. HUS, on the other hand, hasa mortality rate of 3–5% even with intensive care. Abouta third of the survivors have long-term problems withkidney function, and another 8% develop high bloodpressure, seizure disorders, and blindness.\nPrevention\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) offers the\nfollowing suggestions for preventing enterobacterialinfections, including E. coli O157:H7 dysentery:\n• Cook ground beef or hamburgers until the meat is thor-\noughly done. Juices from the meat should be complete-ly clear, not pink or red. All parts of the meat shouldreach a temperature of 70°C (158°F) or higher.\n• Do not drink unpasteurized milk or use products made\nfrom raw milk.\n• Wash hands thoroughly and frequently, especially after\nusing the toilet.\n• Wash fruits and vegetables carefully, or peel them.\nKeep all kitchen surfaces and serving utensils clean.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1206Enterobacterial infectionsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1206• If drinking water is not known to be safe, boil it or\ndrink bottled water.\n• Keep cooked foods separate from raw foods, and avoid\ntouching cooked foods with knives or other utensils thathave been used with raw meat.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennish, Michael L., and Carlos Seas. “Bacterial Diarrheas.”\nIn Current Diagnosis.

    "content": "Enterobiasis\nDefinition\nEnterobiasis, or pinworm infection as it is common-\nly called, is an intestinal infection caused by the parasiticroundworm called Enterobius vermicularis . The most\ncommon symptom of this irritating, but not particularlydangerous, disease is itching around the anal area.Description\nEnterobiasis is also called seatworm infection or\noxyuriasis. In the United States, enterobiasis is the mostcommon worm infection, and some estimate that approx-imately 10% of the United States population is infected.Worldwide, approximately 200 million people are infect-ed. Enterobiasis can affect people of any age, but is mostcommon among children ages 5–14 and particularlyaffects those in the daycare setting.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe disease is highly contagious and is caused by a\nparasitic worm called Enterobius vermicularis . The adult\nfemale worm is about the size of a staple (approximately0.4 in [1 cm] long and 0.02 in [0.5 mm] wide) and has apointed tip. The disease is transmitted by ingesting theeggs of the pinworm. These eggs travel to the small intes-tine where, after approximately one month, they hatchand mature into adult worms. During the night, thefemale adult worms travel to the area around the anusand deposit eggs in the folds of the anal area. A singlefemale pinworm can lay 10,000 eggs and, after layingeggs, dies. The eggs are capable of causing infectionafter six hours at body temperature.\nSignificant itching in the anal region is caused by the\nmovement of the adult worm as the eggs are deposited.When an individual scratches the anal region, the tiny eggsget under the finger nails and in the underwear and nightclothes. Anything the individual touches with the contami-nated fingers, for example, toys, bedding, blankets, bath-room door knobs, or sinks, becomes contaminated. Theeggs are very hardy and can live on surfaces for two tothree weeks. Anyone touching these contaminated sur-faces can ingest the eggs and become infected.

When present, however, symptoms of the infectionbegin approximately two weeks after ingesting the pin-worm eggs. The main symptom is itching around theanus. Because the itching intensifies at night, when thefemale worms comes to the anus to lay eggs, it oftenleads to disrupted sleep and irritability. Poor sleeping atnight in small children can be related to pinworms. Occa-sionally, the itching causes some bleeding and bruisingin the region, and secondary bacterial infections canoccur. In females, the itching may spread to the vaginaand sometimes causes an infection of the vaginal region(vaginitis). Enterobiasis usually lasts one to two months.\nDiagnosis\nFirst, a physician will rule out other potential causes\nof the itching, such as hemorrhoids , lice, or fungal or\nbacterial infection. Once these have been ruled out, anaccurate diagnosis of enterobiasis will require that eitherthe eggs or the adult worms are detected. Rarely, the adultworms are seen as thin, yellowish-white threads, about0.4 in (1 cm) long, in the stools of the infected person.Usually, an hour or so after the individual goes to sleep,the adult female worms may be seen moving around lay-ing eggs if a flashlight is shone at the rectal area.\nAn easier method is to observe the eggs under the\nmicroscope. In order to collect a specimen for laboratorydiagnosis, the physician may provide a paddle with asticky adhesive on one side, or an individual may beinstructed to place a piece of shiny cellophane tape stickyside down against the anal opening. The best time to per-form this test is at night or as soon as the individualwakes up in the morning, before having a bowel move-ment or taking a bath or shower.

When under a microscope in the laboratory, the\neggs will be clearly visible.\nTreatment\nIn order to treat the disease, either mebendazole\n(Vermox) or pyrantel pamoate (Pin-X) will be given intwo oral doses spaced two weeks apart. These medica-tions eradicate the infection in approximately 90% ofcases. Re-infection is common and several treatmentsmay be required. Because the infection is easily spreadthrough contact with contaminated clothing or surfaces,it is recommended that all family members receive thetherapeutic dose. Sometimes a series of six treatmentsare given, each spaced two weeks apart. If family mem-bers continue to be infected, a source outside the housemay be responsible.\nTo relieve the rectal itching, a shallow warm bath\nwith either half a cup of table salt, or Epsom salts is rec-ommended.

    "title": "Enterostomy",
    "content": "Enterostomy\nDefinition\nAn enterostomy is an operation in which the surgeon\nmakes a passage into the patient’s small intestine throughthe abdomen with an opening to allow for drainage or toinsert a tube for feeding. The opening is called a stoma,from the Greek word for mouth. Enterostomies may beeither temporary or permanent. They are classified accord-ing to the part of the intestine that is used to create thestoma. If the ileum, which is the lowest of the three sec-tions of the small intestine, is used to make the stoma, theoperation is called an ileostomy. If the jejunum, which isthe middle section of the small intestine, is used, the oper-ation is called a jejunostomy. Some people use the wordostomy as a word that covers all types of enterostomies.\nPurpose\nEnterostomies are performed in order to create a\nnew opening for the passage of fecal matter when normalintestinal functioning is interrupted or when diseases ofthe intestines cannot be treated by medications or lessradical surgery. Some situations that may require entero-stomies include:\n• Healing of inflamed bowel segments. Enterostomies\nperformed for this reason are usually temporary.\n• Emergency treatment of gunshot or other penetrating\nwounds of the abdomen. An enterostomy is needed to\nprevent the contents of the intestine from causing a seri-ous inflammation of the inside of the abdominal cavity(peritonitis ). These enterostomies are also often tem-\nporary.\n• Placement of a tube for enteral feeding. Enteral feeding\nis a method for conveying nutritional solutions directlyinto the stomach or jejunum through a tube. Tubeenterostomies may be long-term but are not permanent.\n• Removal of diseased sections of the intestines.\nIleostomies performed for this reason are permanent.The most common disorders requiring permanentileostomy are Crohn’s disease ,familial polyposis , and\nulcerative colitis . Familial polyposis and ulcerative\ncolitis are serious health risks because they can developinto cancer .\n• Treatment of advanced cancer or other causes of intesti-\nnal obstruction.\nPrecautions\nEnterostomies are usually performed only as emer-\ngency treatments for traumatic injuries in the abdomen oras final measures for serious disorders of the intestines.Most patients do not refuse to have the operation per-formed when the need for it is explained to them. A smallminority, however, refuse enterostomies because ofstrong psychological reactions to personal disfigurementand the need to relearn bowel habits.\nDescription\nIleostomy\nIleostomies represent about 25% of enterostomies.\nThey are performed after the surgeon removes a diseasedcolon and sometimes the rectum as well. The most com-mon ileostomy is called a Brooke ileostomy after theEnglish surgeon who developed it. In a Brooke ileosto-my, the surgeon makes the stoma in the lower right sec-tion of the abdomen. The ileum is pulled through anopening (incision) in the muscle layer. The surgeon thenturns the cut end of the intestine inside out and sews it tothe edges of the hole. He or she then positions an appli-ance for collecting the fecal material. The appliance con-sists of a plastic bag that fits over the stoma and lies flatagainst the abdomen. The patient is taught to drain thebag from time to time during the day. Ileostomies need tobe emptied frequently because the digested food containslarge amounts of water. Shortly after the operation, theileostomy produces 1–2 qt (0.9–1.91) of fluid per day;after a month or two of adjustment, the volume decreasesto 1–2 pt (0.5–0.9)per day.\nKOCK POUCH (CONTINENT ILEOSTOMY). The Kock\npouch is a variation of the basic ileostomy and is namedfor its Swedish inventor. In the Kock technique, the sur-geon forms a pouch inside the abdominal cavity behindthe stoma that collects the fecal material. The stoma isshaped into a valve to prevent fluid from leaking onto thepatient’s abdomen. The patient then empties the pouchseveral times daily by inserting a tube (catheter) throughthe valve. The Kock technique is sometimes called a con-tinent ileostomy because the fluid is contained inside theabdomen. It is successful in 70–90% of patients whohave it done.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1209EnterostomyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1209Jejunostomy\nA jejunostomy is similar to an ileostomy except that\nthe stoma is placed in the second section of the smallintestine rather than the third. Jejunostomies are per-formed less frequently than ileostomies. They are almostalways temporary procedures.\nTube enterostomies\nTube enterostomies are operations in which the sur-\ngeon makes a stoma into the stomach itself or thejejunum in order to insert a tube for liquid nutrients.Tube enterostomies are performed in patients who needtube feeding for longer than six weeks, or who have hadrecent mouth or nose surgery. As long as the patient’sintestinal tract can function, tube feedings are consid-\nered preferable to intravenous feeding. Enteral nutrition\nis safer than intravenous fluids and helps to keep thepatient’s digestive tract functioning.\nPreparation\nPreoperative preparation includes both patient edu-\ncation and physical preparation.KEY TERMS\nCrohn’s disease —A disease of the intestines that\ncauses inflammation leading to scarring, thickeningof the walls of the intestine, and eventual obstruc-tion.\nDuodenum —The first of the three segments of the\nsmall intestine. The duodenum connects the stom-ach and the jejunum.\nEnteral nutrition —A technique for feeding patients\nwith liquid formulas conveyed directly into thestomach or jejunum through tubes.\nEnterostomal therapist (ET) —A specialized coun-\nselor, usually a registered nurse, who provides osto-my patients with education and counseling beforethe operation. After surgery, the ET helps the patientlearn to take care of the stoma and appliance, andoffers long-term emotional support.\nFamilial polyposis —A disease that runs in families\nin which lumps of tissue (polyps) form inside thecolon. Familial polyposis may develop into cancer.Ileum —The third segment of the small intestine,\nconnecting the jejunum and the large intestine.\nJejunum —The second of the three segments of the\nsmall intestine, connecting the duodenum and theileum.\nKock pouch —A type of ileostomy in which the sur-\ngeon forms an artificial rectum from a section of theileum. A Kock pouch is sometimes called a conti-nent ileostomy because it is drained with a tube.\nOstomy —A common term for all types of enteros-\ntomies.\nStoma —The surgically constructed mouth or pas-\nsage between the intestine and the outside of thepatient’s body.\nTube enterostomy —An enterostomy performed to\nallow the insertion of a feeding tube into thejejunum or stomach.\nUlcerative colitis —A disease of the colon charac-\nterized by inflammation of the mucous lining,ulcerated areas of tissue, and bloody diarrhea.\nPatient education\nIf the patient is going to have a permanent ileosto-\nmy, the doctor will explain what will happen during theoperation and why it is necessary. Most patients are will-ing to accept an ostomy as an alternative to the chronic\npain and diarrhea of ulcerative colitis or the risk of can-\ncer from other intestinal disorders. The patient can alsomeet with an enterostomal therapist (ET) or a member ofthe United Ostomy Association, which is a support groupfor people with ostomies.\nMedical preparation\nThe patient is prepared for surgery with an evalua-\ntion of his or her nutritional status, possible need forblood transfusions, and antibiotics if necessary. If the\npatient does not have an intestinal obstruction or severeinflammation, he or she may be given a large quantity ofa polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution to cleanse theintestines before surgery.\nAftercare\nAftercare of an enterostomy is both psychological\nand medical.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1210EnterostomyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1210Medical aftercare\nIf the enterostomy is temporary, aftercare consists of\nthe usual monitoring of surgical wounds for infection orbleeding. If the patient has had a permanent ileostomy,aftercare includes learning to use the appliance or emptythe Kock pouch; learning to keep the stoma clean; andreadjusting bathroom habits. Recovery takes a long timebecause major surgery is a shock to the system and the\nintestines take several days to resume normal function-ing. The patient’s fluid intake and output will be checkedfrequently to minimize the risk of dehydration .\nPatient education\nIleostomy patients must learn to watch their fluid and\nsalt intake. They are at greater risk of becoming dehydrat-ed in hot weather, from exercise , or from diarrhea. In\nsome cases they may need extra bananas or orange juicein the diet to keep up the level of potassium in the blood.\nPatient education includes social concerns as well as\nphysical self-care. Many ileostomy patients are worriedabout the effects of the operation on their close relationshipsand employment. If the patient has not seen an ET beforethe operation, the aftercare period is a good time to find outabout self-help and support groups. The ET can also evalu-ate the patient’s emotional reactions to the ostomy.\nRisks\nEnterostomies are not considered high-risk opera-\ntions by themselves. About 40% of ileostomy patientshave complications afterward, however; about 15%require minor surgical corrections. Possible complica-tions include:\n• skin irritation caused by leakage of digestive fluids onto\nthe skin around the stoma, irritation is the most com-mon complication of ileostomies\n• diarrhea• the development of abscesses• gallstones or stones in the urinary tract• inflammation of the ileum• odors (can often be prevented by a change in diet)• intestinal obstruction• a section of the bowel pushing out of the body (pro-\nlapse)\nNormal results\nNormal results include recovery from the surgery\nwith few or no complications. About 95% of people withostomies recover completely, are able to return to work,and consider themselves to be in good health. Many\nileostomy patients enjoy being able to eat a full range offoods rather than living on a restricted diet. Somepatients, however, need to be referred to psychotherapiststo deal with depression or other emotional problems afterthe operation.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAltman, Roberta, and Michael J. Sarg.

    "title": "Enterovirus infections",
    "content": "Enterovirus infections\nDefinition\nEnteroviruses are so named because they reproduce\ninitially in the gastrointestinal tract after infection occurs.Despite, this, they usually do not lead to intestinal symp-toms; rather it is their spread to organs, such as the nervoussystem, heart, skin, and others that causes disease.Enteroviruses are part of a larger group of viruses known asPicornaviruses. The word comes from the combination of“pico” (Spanish, meaning “a little bit”), and RNA (ribonu-cleic acid, an important component of genetic material).\nDescription\nThere are four groups of enteroviruses: Coxsack-\nievirus, Echovirus, ungrouped Enterovirus, and YPoliovirus. \nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1211Enterovirus infectionsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1211Viruses are generally divided into those that use\nDNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA as their geneticmaterial; all enteroviruses are RNA viruses. They arefound worldwide, but infection is more common in areasof poor hygiene and overcrowding.\nAlthough most cases of enterovirus do not produce\nsymptoms, some five to 10 million individuals in the Unit-ed States each year suffer from one of the enteroviral dis-eases. Illness is more common in the very young. Whilethere are close to seventy different strains of enteroviruses,over 70% of infections are caused by only 10 types.\nThe virus is most commonly transmitted by the\nfecal-oral route (contamination of fingers or objects byhuman waste material); in some instances transmission isthrough contaminated food or water. Passage of somestrains of virus by way of air droplets can lead to respira-tory illness. Infection of fetuses by way of the placentahas also been documented. Breast milk contains antibod-ies which can protect newborns.\nThe incubation period for most enteroviruses ranges\nfrom two to 14 days. In areas of temperate climate, infec-tions occur mainly in the summer and fall.\nCauses and symptoms\nEnteroviruses are believed to be the cause of at least\n10 distinct illnesses. Once they enter the body, they mul-tiply in the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract, andeventually reach sites of lymphatic tissue (such as thetonsils). While most of these diseases are of short dura-tion and do not cause significant injury, some can pro-duce severe illness.\nThe main syndromes caused by the various entero-\nviruses are the following:\n• Summer grippe (nonspecific febrile illness). This is the\nmost common syndrome, and is characterized by flu-like symptoms of fever ,headache , and weakness, that\ntypically last three to four days. Many patients alsodevelop upper respiratory symptoms and some nausea\nand vomiting . One of the major ways to distinguish\nthis disease from influenza , is the fact that grippe most\noften occurs in the summer.\n• Generalized disease of the newborn is a potentially\nserious infection in which infants from one week tothree months of age develop a syndrome that can bedifficult to distinguish from a severe bacterial infection.Fever, irritability, and decreased responsiveness orexcessive sleepiness are the major symptoms. Inflam-mation of heart muscle ( myocarditis ), low blood pres-\nsure, hepatitis, and meningitis sometimes complicate\nthe illness.• Aseptic meningitis encephalitis is a well known syn-\ndrome caused by this group of viruses. In fact,enteroviruses are responsible for over 90% of cases ofaseptic meningitis, and most often hits children andyoung adults. Headache, fever, avoidance of light, andeye pain are characteristic. Drowsiness may be promi-\nnent, and other symptoms include sore throat ,cough ,\nmuscle pain, and rash. Occasionally, not only themeninges—the covering around the brain and spinalcord— is infected, but also brain tissue itself, produc-ing encephalitis. The illness resolves after about a weekor so, and permanent damage is unusual. Enterovirusescan also produce the Guillian-Barré syndrome, whichinvolves weakness and paralysis of the extremities and\neven the muscles of respiration.\n• Pleurodynia (Bornholm’s disease) is due to viral infec-\ntion and inflammation of the chest and abdominal mus-cles used for breathing. Pain occurs as acute episodes,lasting 30 minutes or so. Coxsackie B virus is the usualcause of the illness.\n• Myocarditis and/or pericarditis involves infection of\nthe heart muscle (myocardium) and the coveringaround the heart (pericardium). Infants and youngadults are the most susceptible, and for some reason,over two-thirds of cases occur in males. The diseaseusually begins as an upper respiratory tract infectionwith cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Chest pain,\nincreasing shortness of breath, irregularities of cardiacrhythm, and heart failure sometimes develop. Some\npatients wind up with long term heart failure if the heartmuscle is significantly affected.\n• Exanthems is the medical term for rashes , and\nenterovirus is the number one cause of summer and fallrashes in children. They occur anywhere on the body,and often resemble diseases such as measles .\n• Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs initially as a sore\nthroat (often involving the tongue as well), and is fol-lowed by a rash on the hands, and sometimes the feet.The rash often forms small blisters, which lead toulcers. Symptoms generally resolve within a week. Aspecific Coxsackievirus (A16) is the most frequentcause of this highly infectious disease.\n• Herpangina is most often caused by one of the Cox-\nsackie A viruses, and appears as the acute onset of feverand sore throat. This last symptom is particularlysevere, as the virus produces multiple ulcers in thethroat. Swallowing becomes very painful; symptomscan persist for several weeks.\n• Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis involves viral infec-\ntion of the conjunctiva, which is a covering around theeye. Pain, blurred vision, aversion to light, and a dis-charge from the eye are the main symptoms. Headache\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1212Enterovirus infectionsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1212and fever occur in about one in five patients. The dis-\nease runs its course in about 10 days.\nA number of other illnesses have been attributed to\nenteroviruses, including pneumonia and other respirato-\nry infections, myositis or muscle inflammation, arthritis,and acute inflammation of the kidneys. It is clear thenthat these viruses produce a number of various illnesses,most often in younger age groups.\nDiagnosis\nIn the majority of cases, diagnosis is based on the\ncharacteristic symptoms that the virus produces (such asthe chest pain in pleurodynia). Rarely is it necessary toidentify a specific strain of virus causing the illness. It ismore important to be certain that the infection is due to avirus which does not require treatment with antibiotics .\nCulture, or growing the organism outside of the body,\nis helpful only when obtained from areas that tend to indi-cate recent infection, such as from swollen joints, cere-brospinal fluid, or blood. Cultures from other areas, suchas the throat, can be misleading. This is because the virusmay remain for long periods of time in places with a largeamount of lymphatic tissue. As a rule, cultures done earlyin the illness are more likely to identify the virus.\nNew techniques that involve identification of viral\ngenetic material (PCR) are useful in certain cases, but arenot indicated for routine testing.\nTreatment\nAs noted above, enterovirus is capable of attacking\nmany different organs and producing a variety of symp-toms. Most infections are mild and improve withoutcomplications, and require no specific therapy. When thevirus attacks critical organs however, such as the heart,respiratory muscles, nervous system, etc., then special-ized care is often needed.\nAs of 2001, no effective antiviral medication for\nenterovirus has undergone investigation in patients,though some drugs appear promising for the future. Insome patients who are unable to produce antibodies(hypogammaglobunemia), administrating antibodiesthemselves is helpful.\nPrognosis\nThe overall outlook for enterovirus infection\ndepends on the organs involved, and the immune condi-tion of the individual patient. Unless vital organs areinvolved or immunity is abnormal, infection causes fewproblems. On the other hand, patients who have diseasesKEY TERMS\nAntibodies —Proteins that are formed by the body\nand play a role in defense against infection.\nAntibiotic —A medication that is designed to kill\nor weaken bacteria.\nMeninges —Outer covering of the spinal cord and\nbrain. Infection is called meningitis, which canlead to damage to the brain or spinal cord andlead to death.\nthat affect antibody production can develop chronic\ninfection of the brain or meninges.\nPrevention\nIn the hospital setting, the best means of avoiding\ntransmission of infection is the use of good hand-wash-ing practices and other appropriate precautions (gownsand gloves for hospital staff). The virus is found in fecesfor up to one week after infection; therefore precautionsthat isolate waste material (enteric precautions) will helpdecrease the chance of spreading the illness.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCohen, Jeffrey I. “Enteroviruses and Reoviruses.” In Harri-\nson’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Enzyme therapy",
    "content": "Enzyme therapy\nDefinition\nEnyzme therapy is a plan of dietary supplements of\nplant and animal enzymes used to facilitate the digestiveprocess and improve the body’s ability to maintain bal-anced metabolism.\nPurpose\nIn traditional medicine, enzyme supplements are\noften prescribed for patients suffering from disordersthat affect the digestive process, such as cystic\nfibrosis , Gaucher’s disease, and celiac disease . A pro-\ngram of enzyme supplementation is rarely recommend-ed for healthy patients. However, proponents ofenzyme therapy believe that such a program is benefi-cial for everyone. They point to enzymes’ ability topurify the blood, strengthen the immune system,enhance mental capacity, cleanse the colon, and main-tain proper pH balance in urine. They feel that byimproving the digestive process, the body is better ableto combat infection and disease.\nSome evidence exists that pancreatic enzymes\nderived from animal sources are helpful in cancer treat-\nment. The enzymes may be able to dissolve the coatingon cancer cells and may make it easier for the immunesystem to attack the cancer.\nA partial list of the wide variety of complaints and\nillnesses that can be treated by enzyme therapy includes:\n• AIDS\n• anemia• alcohol consumption• anxiety\n• acute inflammation\n• back pain• cancer• colds• chronic fatigue syndrome\n• colitis• constipation\n•diarrhea\n• food allergies\n• gastritis• gastric duodenal ulcer• gout• headaches• hepatitis• hypoglycemia• infections• mucous congestion• multiple sclerosis• nervous disorders• nutritional disorders• obesity• premenstrual syndrome (PMS)• stress\nDescription\nOrigins\nEnzymes are protein molecules used by the body to\nperform all of its chemical actions and reactions. Thebody manufactures several thousands of enzymes.Among them are the digestive enzymes produced by thestomach, pancreas, small intestine, and the salivaryglands of the mouth. Their energy-producing propertiesare responsible for not only the digestion of nutrients, buttheir absorption, transportation, metabolization, andelimination as well.\nEnzyme therapy is based on the work of Dr. Edward\nHowell in the 1920s and 1930s. Howell proposed thatenzymes from foods work in the stomach to pre-digestfood. He advocated the consumption of large amounts ofplant enzymes, theorizing that if the body had to use lessof its own enzymes for digestion, it could store them formaintaining metabolic harmony. Four categories of plantenzymes are helpful in pre-digestion: protease, amylase,lipase, and cellulase. Cellulase is particularly helpfulbecause the body is unable to produce it.\nAnimal enzymes, such as pepsin extracted from the\nstomach of pigs, work more effectively in the duodenum.They are typically used for the treatment of nondigestiveailments.\nThe seven categories of food enzymes and their\nactivities\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1214Enzyme therapyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1214• amylase breaks down starches\n• cellulase breaks down fibers\n• lactase breaks down dairy products\n• lipase breaks down fats\n• maltase breaks down grains\n• protease breaks down proteins• sucrase breaks down sugars\nEnzyme theory generated further interest as the\nhuman diet became more dependent on processed andcooked foods. Enzymes are extremely sensitive to heat,and temperatures above 118°F (48°C) destroy them. Mod-ern processes of pasteurization, canning, and microwavingare particularly harmful to the enzymes in food.\nEnzyme supplements are extracted from plants like\npineapple and papaya and from the organs of cows andpigs. The supplements are typically given in tablet orcapsule form. Pancreatic enzymes may also be given byinjection. The dosage varies with the condition beingtreated. For nondigestive ailments, the supplements aretaken in the hour before meals so that they can be quicklyabsorbed into the blood. For digestive ailments, the sup-plements are taken immediately before meals accompa-nied by a large glass of fluids. Pancreatic enzymes maybe accompanied by doses of vitamin A.\n7Preparations\nNo special preparations are necessary before begin-\nning enzyme therapy. However, it is always advisable totalk to a doctor or pharmacist before purchasing enzymesand beginning therapy.\nPrecautions\nPeople with allergies to beef, pork, pineapples, and\npapaya may suffer allergic reactions to enzyme supple-ments. Tablets are often coated to prevent them frombreaking down in the stomach, and usually shouldn’t bechewed or crushed. People who have difficulty swallow-ing pills can request enzyme supplements in capsuleform. The capsules can then be opened and the contentssprinkled onto soft foods like applesauce.\nSide effects\nSide effects associated with enzyme therapy include\nheartburn ,nausea and vomiting , diarrhea, bloating,\ngas, and acne . According to the principles of therapy,\nthese are temporary cleansing symptoms. Drinking eightto ten glasses of water daily and getting regular exercise\ncan reduce the discomfort of these side effects. Individu-als may also experience an increase in bowel move-KEY TERMS\nCeliac disease —A chronic disease characterized\nby defective digestion and use of fats.\nCystic fibrosis —A genetic disease that causes mul-\ntiple digestive, excretion, and respiratory complica-tions.

This is also consid-\nered a positive effect.\nPlant enzymes are safe for pregnant women,\nalthough they should always check with a doctor beforeusing enzymes. Pregnant women should avoid animalenzymes. In rare cases, extremely high doses of enzymescan result in a build up of uric acid in the blood or urineand can cause a break down of proteins.\nResearch and general acceptance\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) has classified enzymes as a food. Therefore,they can be purchased without a prescription. However,insurance coverage is usually dependent upon the thera-py resulting from a doctor’s orders.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCassileth, Barrie R.

Eosinophilic pneumonia is characterizedby a large number of eosinophils in the lungs, usually inthe absence of an infectious disease. Eosinophils areone of the white blood cells and are classified as a gran-ulocyte. They are part of the non-specific immune sys-tem and participate in inflammatory reactions.Eosinophils contain cationic molecules that are usefulfor destroying infectious agents, especially heiminthicparasites (worms). There are several types ofeosinophilic pneumonia. Loffler’s pneumonia is a tem-porary infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs. Thepatient will feel tired, have a cough , spasms of the\nbronchial airway, and difficulty breathing. Loffler’spneumonia will clear spontaneously, but slowly overthe course of about a month. Another form ofeosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates witheosinophilia (PIE), is a more serious and potentiallyfatal disease. In PIE, the patient experiences asthma ,\npulmonary infiltrates, disorders of the peripheral ner-vous system, central nervous systems symptoms, andperiarteritis nodosa.\nCauses and symptoms\nPneumonia with eosinophils occurs as part of a\nhypersensitivity reaction. A hypersensitivity reactionis an over-reaction of the immune system to a particu-lar stimulus. As part of the hypersensitive reaction,cells of the immune system are produced in increasednumbers and migrate into areas targeted by the hyper-sensitivity reaction. In the case of eosinophilic pneu-monia, the lungs are the target. Generally, eosinophiliapneumonia is not a reaction to an infection. There is acorrelation between asthma and eosinophilic pneumo-nia. Eosinophilic pneumonia can also be caused bydrugs and, in some people, by polluted air. The symp-toms range from mild (coughing, wheezing , and\nshortness of breath ) to severe and life threatening\n(severe shortness of breath and difficulty gettingenough oxygen). The symptoms may resolve sponta-neously or can persist for long periods of time.

Blisteringoften appears in infancy in response to simply being held orhandled. In rarer forms of the disorder, EB can be life-threatening. There is no cure for the disorder. Treatmentfocuses on preventing and treating wounds and infection.\nDescription\nEpidermolysis bullosa has three major forms and at\nleast 16 subtypes. The three major forms are EB simplex,junctional EB, and dystrophic EB. These can range inseverity from mild blistering to more disfiguring and life-threatening disease. Physicians diagnose the form of thedisease based on where the blister forms in relation to theepidermis (the skin’s outermost layer) and the deeperdermis layer.\nThe prevalence of epidermolysis varies among dif-\nferent populations. A study in Scotland estimated theprevalence to be one in 20,400. Researchers in otherparts of the world estimate the prevalence to be one in100,000. This variance is due to the variability of expres-sion. Many cases of epidermolysis bullosa are often notaccurately diagnosed and thus, are not reported.\nCauses and symptoms\nEB can be inherited as the result of a dominant\ngenetic abnormality (only one parent carries the abnor-mal gene) or a recessive genetic abnormality (both par-ents carry the abnormal gene).\nEB simplex results from mutations in genes respon-\nsible for keratin 5 and 14, which are proteins that givecells of the epidermis its structure. EB simplex is trans-mitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.\nDystrophic EB is caused by mutations in genes for\ntype VII collagen, the protein contained in the fibersanchoring the epidermis to the deeper layers of the skin.The genetic mutations for junctional EB are found in thegenes responsible for producing the protein Laminin-5.Dystrophic EB is an autosomal disorder and will onlyresult if both parents transmit an abnormal gene duringconception.\nEB simplex, the most common form of EB, is the\nleast serious form of the disease. In most affected indi-viduals, the blisters are mild and do not scar after theyheal. Some forms of EB simplex affect just the hands andKEY TERMS\nCollagen —The main supportive protein of carti-\nlage, connective tissue, tendon, skin, and bone.\nDermis —The layer of skin beneath the epidermis.\nEpidermis —The outermost layer of the skin.\nKeratin —A tough, nonwater-soluble protein found\nin the nails, hair, and the outermost layer of skin.Human hair is made up largely of keratin.\nfeet. Other forms of EB simplex can lead to more wide-\nspread blistering, as well as hair loss and missing teeth.Recurrent blistering is annoying but not life threatening.\nThe second, or junctional, form of EB does not lead to\nscarring. However, skin on the areas prone to blistering,such as elbows and knees, often shrinks. In one variationof junctional EB, called gravis junctional EB of Herlitz,the blistering can be so severe that affected infants may notsurvive due to massive infection and dehydration .\nThe third form of EB, dystrophic EB, varies greatly\nin terms of severity, but more typically affects the armsand legs. In one variation, called Hallopeau-Siemens EB,repeated blistering and scarring of the hands and feetcauses the fingers and toes to fuse, leaving them dysfunc-tional and with a mitten-like appearance.\nDiagnosis\nPhysicians and researchers distinguish between the\nthree major subtypes of EB based on which layer of theepidermis separates from the deeper dermis layer of theskin below. Patients suspected of having EB should have afresh blister biopsied for review. This sample of tissue isexamined under an electron microscope or under a con-ventional microscope using a technique called immunoflu-orescence, which helps to map the underlying structure.\nKnowing that a family member has EB can help\nestablish the diagnosis, but it is possible that parents orsiblings will show no sign of the disease, either becauseit is caused by a new genetic mutation, or because theparents are carriers of the recessive trait and do not dis-play the disease.\nTreatment\nThe most important treatment for EB is daily wound\ncare. Because the skin is very fragile, care must be takento be certain that dressing changes do not cause furtherdamage. Tape should not be applied directly to skin and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1217Epidermolysis bullosaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1217bandages should be soaked off. Infection is a major con-\ncern, so a topical antibiotic, such as bacitracin, mupirocin,or sulfadiazine, should be routinely applied. Among per-sons with recessive dystrophic EB, the anticonvulsantphenytoin is sometimes effective because it decreasesproduction of an enzyme that breaks down collagen.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis of EB varies depending on the subtype\nof the disease. Individuals with EB simplex can live long,fulfilling lives. The severity of the junctional and dys-trophic forms of EB can vary greatly. Infants affected withsome forms of the disease often do not survive infancy;other forms can lead to severe scarring and disfigurement.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFine, Jo-David, et al.

    "content": "Epididymitis\nDefinition\nEpididymitis is inflammation or infection of the epi-\ndidymis. In this long coiled tube attached to the upperpart of each testicle, sperm mature and are stored beforeejaculation.\nDescription\nEpididymitis is the most common cause of pain in\nthe scrotum. The acute form is usually associated withthe most severe pain and swelling. If symptoms last formore than six weeks after treatment begins, the conditionis considered chronic.\nEpididymitis can occur any time after the onset of\npuberty but is most common between the ages of 18 and\n40. It is especially common among members of the mili-tary who exercise for extended periods without emptying\ntheir bladders.\nFactors that increase the risk of developing epi-\ndidymitis include:\n• infection of the bladder, kidney, prostate, or urinary tract• other recent illness\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1218EpididymitisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1218• narrowing of the urethra (the tube that drains urine\nfrom the bladder)\n• use of a urethral catheter.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough epididymitis can be caused by the same\norganisms that cause some sexually transmitted dis-\neases (STDs) or occur after prostate surgery, the condi-\ntion is generally due to pus-generating bacteria associat-ed with infections in other parts of the body.\nEpididymitis can also be caused by injury or infec-\ntion of the scrotum or by irritation from urine that hasaccumulated in the vas deferens (the duct through whichsperm travels after leaving the epididymis).\nEpididymitis is characterized by sudden redness and\nswelling of the scrotum. The affected testicle is hard andsore, and the other testicle may feel tender. The patienthas chills and fever and usually has acute urethritis\n(inflammation of the urethra).\nEnlarged lymph nodes in the groin cause scrotal pain\nthat intensifies throughout the day and may become sosevere that walking normally becomes impossible.\nDiagnosis\nLaboratory tests used to diagnose epididymitis\ninclude:\n• urinalysis and urine culture\n• examination of discharges from the urethra and prostate\ngland\n• blood tests to measure white-cell counts\nTreatment\nBecause epididymitis that affects both testicles can\nmake a man sterile, antibiotic therapy must be initiatedas soon as symptoms appear. To prevent reinfection,medication must be taken exactly as prescribed, even ifthe patient’s symptoms disappear or he begins to feel bet-ter. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories can relievepain but should not be used without the approval of afamily physician or urologist.\nBed rest is recommended until symptoms subside,\nand patients are advised to wear athletic supporters whenthey resume normal activities. If pain is severe, a localanesthetic like lidocaine (Xylocaine) may be injecteddirectly into the spermatic cord.\nSelf-care\nA patient who has epididymitis should not drink\nbeverages that contain caffeine . To prevent constipation ,he should use stool softeners or eat plenty of fruit, nuts,\nwhole grain cereals, and other foods with laxative prop-erties.\nAn ice bag wrapped in a towel can reduce pain and\nswelling but should be removed from the inflamed areafor a few minutes every hour to prevent burns .\nStrenuous activity should be avoided until symp-\ntoms disappear. Sexual activity should not be resumeduntil a month after symptoms disappear.\nIf a second course of treatment doesn’t eradicate\nstubborn symptoms, longterm anti-inflammatory therapymay be recommended. In rare instances, chronic symp-toms require surgery.\nSurgery\nEach of the surgical procedures used to treat epi-\ndidymitis is performed under local anesthesia on an out-patient basis. Both of them cause sterility.\nEpididymectomy involves removing the inflamed\nsection of the epididymitis through a small incision in thescrotum.\nBilateral vasectomy prevents fluid and sperm from\npassing through the epididymis. This procedure is usual-ly performed on men who have chronic epididymitis oron elderly patients undergoing prostate surgery.\nPrognosis\nPain generally subsides 24–72 hours after treatment\nbegins. Complete healing may take weeks or months.\nPrevention\nUsing condoms and not having sex with anyone who\nhas an STD can prevent some cases of epididymitis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nShaw, Michael, ed.

These are both connected to the larynx, atube made of cartilage. The air continues down the larynxto the trachea. The trachea then splits into two branches,the left and right bronchi (bronchial tubes). These bronchibranch into smaller air tubes that run within the lungs,leading to the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli).\nEither food, liquid, or air may be taken in through\nthe mouth. While air goes into the larynx and the respira-tory system, food and liquid are directed into the tubeleading to the stomach, the esophagus. Because food orliquid in the bronchial tubes or lungs could cause ablockage or lead to an infection, the airway is protected.The epiglottis is a leaf-like piece of cartilage extendingupwards from the larynx. The epiglottis can close downover the larynx when someone is eating or drinking, pre-venting these food and liquids from entering the airway.\nEpiglottitis is an infection and inflammation of the\nepiglottis. Because the epiglottis may swell considerably,there is a danger that the airway will be blocked off bythe very structure designed to protect it. Air is thenunable to reach the lungs. Without intervention, epiglotti-tis has the potential to be fatal.\nEpiglottitis is primarily a disease of two to seven-\nyear-old children, although older children and adults canalso contract it. Boys are twice as likely as girls to devel-op this infection. Because epiglottitis involves swellingand infection of tissues, which are all located at or abovethe level of the epiglottis, it is sometimes referred to assupraglottitis ( supra, meaning above). About 25% of all\nchildren with this infection also have pneumonia .\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common cause of epiglottitis is infection\nwith the bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b.\nOther types of bacteria are also occasionally responsi-ble for this infection, including some types of Strepto-\ncoccus bacteria and the bacteria responsible for causing\ndiphtheria .\nA patient with epiglottitis typically experiences a\nsudden fever , and begins having severe throat and neckpain . Because the swollen epiglottis interferes signifi-\ncantly with air movement, every breath creates a loud,harsh, high-pitched sound referred to as stridor . Because\nthe vocal cords are located in the larynx just below thearea of the epiglottis, the swollen epiglottis makes thepatient’s voice sound muffled and strained. Swallowingbecomes difficult, and the patient may drool. The patientoften leans forward and juts out his or her jaw, whilestruggling for breath.\nEpiglottitis strikes suddenly and progresses quickly.\nA child may begin complaining of a sore throat , and\nwithin a few hours be suffering from extremely severeairway obstruction.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis begins with a high level of suspicion that\na quickly progressing illness with fever, sore throat, andairway obstruction is very likely to be epiglottitis. Ifepiglottitis is suspected, no efforts should be made tolook at the throat, or to swab the throat in order to obtaina culture for identification of the causative organism.These maneuvers may cause the larynx to go into spasm(laryngospasm), completely closing the airway. Theseprocedures should only be performed in a fully-equippedoperating room, so that if laryngospasm occurs, a breath-ing tube can be immediately placed in order to keep theairway open.\nAn instrument called a laryngoscope is often used in\nthe operating room to view the epiglottis, which willappear cherry-red and quite swollen. An x-ray picturetaken from the side of the neck should also be obtained.The swollen epiglottis has a characteristic appearance,called the “thumb sign.”\nTreatment\nTreatment almost always involves the immediate\nestablishment of an artificial airway: inserting a breath-ing tube into the throat (intubation); or making a tinyopening toward the base of the neck and putting a breath-ing tube into the trachea (tracheostomy). Because thepatient’s apparent level of distress may not match theactual severity of the situation, and because the disease’sprogression can be quite surprisingly rapid, it is prefer-able to go ahead and place the artificial airway, ratherthan adopting a wait-and-see approach.\nBecause epiglottitis is caused by a bacteria, antibi-\notics such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin with\nsulbactam should be given through a needle placed in avein (intravenously). This prevents the bacteria that arecirculating throughout the bloodstream from causinginfection elsewhere in the body.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1220EpiglottitisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1220Prognosis\nWith treatment (including the establishment of an\nartificial airway), only about 1% of children with epiglot-titis die. Without the artificial airway, this figure jumps to6%. Most patients recover form the infection, and canhave the breathing tube removed (extubation) within afew days.\nPrevention\nPrevention involves the use of a vaccine against H.\ninfluenzae type b (called the Hib vaccine). It is given to\nbabies at two, four, six, and 15 months. Use of this vac-cine has made epiglottitis a very rare occurrence.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDurand, Marlenel. “Laryngitis, Croup, and Epiglottitis.” In\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

This is doneduring the last stages of labor and delivery to expand theopening of the vagina to prevent tearing during the deliv-ery of the baby.\nPurpose\nThis procedure is usually done during the delivery or\nbirthing process when the vaginal opening does notstretch enough to allow the baby to be delivered withouttearing the surrounding tissue.\nPrecautions\nPrior to the onset of labor, pregnant women may\nwant to discuss the use of episiotomy with their careproviders. It is possible that, with adequate preparationand if the stages of labor and delivery are managed withadequate coaching and support, the need for an episioto-my may be reduced.\nDescription\nAn episiotomy is a surgical incision, usually made\nwith sterile scissors, in the perineum as the baby’s head isbeing delivered. This procedure may be used if the tissuearound the vaginal opening begins tearing or does not seemto be stretching enough to allow the baby to be delivered.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1221EpisiotomyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1221In most cases, the physician makes a midline inci-\nsion along a straight line from the lowest edge of thevaginal opening to toward the anus. In other cases, theepisiotomy is performed by making a diagonal incisionacross the midline between the vagina and anus. Thismethod is used much less often, may be more painful,and may require more healing time than the midline inci-sion. After the baby is delivered through the extendedvaginal opening, the incision is closed with stitches. Alocal anesthetic agent may be applied or injected to numbthe area before it is sewn up (sutured).\nSeveral reasons are cited for performing epi-\nsiotomies. Some experts believe that an episiotomyspeeds up the birthing process, making it easier for thebaby to be delivered. This can be important if there is anysign of distress that may harm the mother or baby.Because tissues in this area may tear during the delivery,another reason for performing an episiotomy is that aclean incision is easier to repair than a jagged tear andmay heal faster. Although the use of episiotomy is some-times described as protecting the pelvic muscles and pos-sibly preventing future problems with urinary inconti-\nnence , it is not clear that the procedure actually helps.\nThe use of episiotomy during the birthing process is\nfairly widespread in the United States. Estimates of epi-siotomy use in hospitals range from 65–95% of deliver-ies, depending on how many times the mother has givenbirth previously. This routine use of episiotomy is beingreexamined in many hospitals and health care settings.However, an episiotomy is always necessary during a\nforceps delivery because of the size of the forceps.\nPreparation\nIt may be possible to avoid the need for an episioto-\nmy. Pregnant women may want to talk with their careproviders about the use of episiotomy during the deliv-ery. Kegel exercises are often recommended during thepregnancy to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.\nPrenatal perineal massage may help to stretch and relaxthe tissue around the vaginal opening. During the deliv-ery process, warm compresses can be applied to the areaalong with the use of perineal massage. Coaching andsupport are also important during the delivery process. Aslowed, controlled pushing during the second stage oflabor (when the mother gets the urge to push) may allowthe tissues to stretch rather than tear. Also, an uprightbirthing position (rather than one where the mother islying down) may decrease the need for an episiotomy.\nAftercare\nThe area of the episiotomy may be uncomfortable or\neven painful for several days. Several practices canrelieve some of the pain . Cold packs can be applied to\nthe perineal area to reduce swelling and discomfort. Useof the Sitz bath available at the hospital or birth center\ncan ease the discomfort, too. This unit circulates warmwater over the area.

    "content": "Epstein-Barr virus test\nDefinition\nThe Epstein-Barr virus test is a blood test, or group of\ntests, to determine the presence or absence of antibodies inthe blood stream directed against proteins of the Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of infectious mononucleosis .\nPurpose\nThe test is primarily used to detect whether first time\ninfection (called primary infection) with the Epstein-Barrvirus is currently occurring, or has occurred within ashort period of time. The pattern of the antibodies detect-ed can, however, tell if the person has never been infect-ed with the Epstein-Barr virus, or if the infectionoccurred in the more distant past. These tests are mostlyutilized in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associatedinfectious mononucleosis when the more common diag-nostic test, the heterophile antibody, is negative, or in sit-uations where the infection is manifesting unusual symp-toms. Therefore, the tests are often not needed in a situa-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1223Epstein-Barr virus testGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1223tion where a doctor believes that a person has mononu-\ncleosis and the heterophile test (also called the monospottest) is positive.\nIn addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not\nneeded in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last-ing fatigue , and may have the chronic fatigue syn-\ndrome . Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic-\nular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in thediagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longerappears to be the case.\nPrecautions\nAs in any blood test, standard precautions should be\nperformed to prevent infection at the site where the bloodis obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally,the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to theblood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle andsyringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres-sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped.\nDescription\nThese tests are more often performed in a consulting\nlaboratory than at a physician’s office or in a hospitallaboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performedon serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after thewhole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies canbe detected against several components of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV earlyantigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and thenuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif-ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages)of the virus’ growth.\nAt the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus,\nantibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to sixmonths only. This antibody, however, persists substan-tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBVinfection in the more remote past. The absence of anti-body to EA when other EBV antibodies are presentstrongly suggests that first time infection with EBVoccurred in the past.\nAntibody to VCA is found both early and late in\nEBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody ofboth the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four tosix months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCAcan be found.\nUnlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to\nEBNA does not usually develop until recovery from firsttime infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectableamounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness whichmight be caused by EBV makes the causal relationshipvery unlikely.Preparation\nThe skin area from which the blood sample will be\nobtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol oriodine.\nAftercare\nThe aftercare is similar to that for any blood test.\nUsually, pressure is applied to the area for severalmoments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficultto interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, afterwaiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts ofantibody detected between the two tests can be particu-larly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis.\nRisks\nThere are no risks over and above those of having\nblood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are moreexpensive than many other blood tests but are usuallycovered by medical insurance.\nNormal results\nThe pattern of the three antibodies can be used to\ndetermine whether the person has not had infection withEBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current-ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; orhas had first time infection with EBV sometime in thepast (more than six months ago).\nIf one defines “normal” results as either not having\nEBV in the past, and call that category one; or havinghad it in the past, and call that category two. Most youngchildren below the age of five will fall into category one,while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall intocategory two.\nThe results for susceptibility are:\n• antibody to EA = negative\n• antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative\n• antibody to EBNA = Negative\nThe results for past infection are:\n• antibody to EA = negative (90% of time)\n• antibody to VCA IgM = negative\n• antibody to VCA IgG = positive\n• antibody to EBNA = positive\nIt is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr virus,\nlike all the human herpes viruses, does not totally leavethe body after the patient recovers from illness. WithEBV , the virus will intermittently recur in the saliva ofpeople without any symptoms. Such people will have a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1224Epstein-Barr virus testGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1224test pattern of previous infection. It is this group of peo-\nple who can transmit EBV to others without themselvesbeing ill.\nAbnormal results\nThe results for current or recent infection are:\n• antibody to EA = positive\n• antibody to VCA IgM = positive\n• antibody to VCA IgG = positive• antibody to EBNA = negative\nWithout the pattern of the three antibodies, it can be\ndifficult to be accurate in interpretation. The presence ofantibody to VCA IgM is the best single test for current orrecent first time infection.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBailey, R. Eugene. “Infectious Mononucleosis.” In Current\nDiagnosis. V ol. 9.

The infection occurs most often in\nyoung infants and the elderly.\nCauses and symptoms\nErysipelas usually occurs rather abruptly. When the\npreceding infection was strep throat, the rash begins onthe face. Occasionally, when the preceding infection wasof a wound from an injury or operation, the rash willappear on an arm or leg.\nClassically, the usual presentation is a bright-red,\nbutterfly-shaped rash appearing across the bridge of thenose and the cheeks. It is hot to the touch, painful, shiny,and swollen, with clearly defined margins. The edges ofthe rash are a raised ridge, hard to the touch. There maybe fluid-filled bumps scattered along the area. The rashspreads rapidly. Some patients have swelling of the eye-lids, sometimes so severe that their eyes swell shut. Thepatient may have fever , chills, loss of energy, nausea\nand vomiting , and swollen, tender lymph nodes. In\nsevere cases, walled-off areas of pus (abscesses) maydevelop beneath the skin. If left untreated, the strepto-coccal bacteria may begin circulating in the bloodstream(a condition called bacteremia ). A patient may then\ndevelop an overwhelming, systemic infection called sep-\nsis, with a high risk of death .\nDiagnosis\nThe rash of erysipelas is very characteristic, raising\nthe practitioner’s suspicion towards that diagnosis, espe-cially when coupled with a history of recent strep infec-tion. Attempts to culture (grow) the bacteria from a sam-ple of the rash usually fail. When the bacteria are presentin the blood, they may be grown in a laboratory, andidentified under a microscope. Other laboratory testsinvolve reacting fluorescently-tagged antibodies with asample of the patient’s infected tissue. This type of testmay be successful in positively identifying the strepto-coccal bacteria.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1225ErysipelasGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1225Treatment\nPenicillin is the drug of choice for treating erysipelas.\nIt can usually be given by mouth, although in severe cases(or in cases of diagnosed bacteremia) it may be giventhrough a needle placed in a vein (intravenously).\nEven with antibiotic treatment, swelling may contin-\nue to spread. Other symptoms, such as fever, pain , and\nredness, usually decrease rapidly after penicillin is start-ed. Cold packs and pain relievers may help decrease dis-comfort. Within about five to 10 days, the affected skinmay begin drying up and flaking off.\nPrognosis\nWith prompt treatment, the prognosis from erysi-\npelas is excellent. Delay of treatment, however, increasesthe chance for bacteremia and the potential for deathfrom overwhelming sepsis. This is particularly true ofpeople with weakened immune systems (babies, theelderly, and people ill with other diseases, especiallyAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS ).

    "content": "Erythroblastosis fetalis\nDefinition\nErythroblastosis fetalis refers to two potentially dis-\nabling or fatal blood disorders in infants: Rh incompatibil-ity disease and ABO incompatibility disease. Either dis-ease may be apparent before birth and can cause fetaldeath in some cases. The disorder is caused by incompati-\nbility between a mother’s blood and her unborn baby’sblood. Because of the incompatibility, the mother’simmune system may launch an immune response againstthe baby’s red blood cells. As a result, the baby’s blood\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1227Erythroblastosis fetalisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1227cells are destroyed, and the baby may suffer severe anemia\n(deficiency in red blood cells), brain damage, or death.\nDescription\nRed blood cells carry several types of proteins,\ncalled antigens, on their surfaces. The A, B, and O anti-gens are used to classify a person’s blood as type A, B,AB, or O. Each parent passes one A, B, or O antigengene to their child. How the genes are paired determinesthe person’s blood type.\nA person who inherits an A antigen gene from each\nparent has type A blood; receiving two B antigen genescorresponds with type B blood; and inheriting A and Bantigen genes means a person has type AB blood. If theO antigen gene is inherited from both parents, the childhas type O blood; however, the pairing of A and O anti-gen genes corresponds with type A blood; and if the Bantigen gene is matched with the O antigen gene, the per-son has type B blood.\nAnother red blood cell antigen, called the Rh factor,\nalso plays a role in describing a person’s blood type. Aperson with at least one copy of the gene for the Rh fac-tor has Rh-positive blood; if no copies are inherited, theperson’s blood type is Rh-negative. In blood typing, thepresence of A, B, and O antigens, plus the presence orabsence of the Rh-factor, determine a person’s specificblood type, such as A-positive, B-negative, and so on.\nA person’s blood type has no effect on health. How-\never, an individual’s immune system considers only thatperson’s specific blood type, or a close match, accept-able. If a radically different blood type is introduced intothe bloodstream, the immune system produces antibod-ies, proteins that specifically attack and destroy any cellcarrying the foreign antigen.\nDetermining a person’s blood type is very important\nif she becomes pregnant. Blood cells from the unbornbaby (fetal red blood cells) can cross over into the moth-er’s bloodstream, especially at delivery. If the mother andher baby have compatible blood types, the crossoverdoes not present any danger. However, if the blood typesare incompatible, the mother’s immune system manufac-tures antibodies against the baby’s blood.\nUsually, this incompatibility is not a factor in a first\npregnancy , because few fetal blood cells reach the\nmother’s bloodstream until delivery. The antibodies thatform after delivery cannot affect the first child. In laterpregnancies, fetuses and babies may be in grave danger.The danger arises from the possibility that the mother’santibodies will attack the fetal red blood cells. If thishappens, the fetus or baby can suffer severe health effectsand may die.There are two types of incompatibility diseases: Rh\nincompatibility disease and ABO incompatibility disease.Both diseases have similar symptoms, but Rh disease ismuch more severe, because anti-Rh antibodies cross overthe placenta more readily than anti-A or anti-B antibod-ies. (The immune system does not form antibodiesagainst the O antigen.) Therefore, a greater percentage ofthe baby’s blood cells are destroyed by Rh disease.\nBoth incompatibility diseases are uncommon in the\nUnited States due to medical advances over the last 50years. For example, prior to 1946 (when newborn bloodtransfusions were introduced) 20,000 babies were affectedby Rh disease yearly. Further advances, such as suppress-ing the mother’s antibody response, have reduced the inci-dence of Rh disease to approximately 4,000 cases per year.\nRh disease only occurs if a mother is Rh-negative and\nher baby is Rh-positive. For this situation to occur, the babymust inherit the Rh factor gene from the father. Most peo-ple are Rh-positive. Only 15% of the caucasian populationis Rh-negative, compared to 5–7% of the african americanpopulation and virtually none of Asian populations.\nABO incompatibility disease is almost always limit-\ned to babies with A or B antigens whose mothers havetype O blood. Approximately one third of these babiesshow evidence of the mother’s antibodies in their blood-stream, but only a small percentage develop symptoms ofABO incompatibility disease.\nCause and symptoms\nRh disease and ABO incompatibility disease are\ncaused when a mother’s immune system produces anti-bodies against the red blood cells of her unborn child.The antibodies cause the baby’s red blood cells to bedestroyed and the baby develops anemia. The baby’sbody tries to compensate for the anemia by releasingimmature red blood cells, called erythroblasts, from thebone marrow.\nThe overproduction of erythroblasts can cause the\nliver and spleen to become enlarged, potentially causingliver damage or a ruptured spleen. The emphasis on ery-throblast production is at the cost of producing othertypes of blood cells, such as platelets and other factorsimportant for blood clotting. Since the blood lacks clot-ting factors, excessive bleeding can be a complication.\nThe destroyed red blood cells release the blood’s\nred pigment (hemoglobin) which degrades into a yellowsubstance called bilirubin. Bilirubin is normally pro-duced as red blood cells die, but the body is onlyequipped to handle a certain low level of bilirubin in thebloodstream at one time. Erythroblastosis fetalis over-whelms the removal system, and high levels of bilirubin\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1228Erythroblastosis fetalisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1228accumulate, causing hyperbilirubinemia, a condition in\nwhich the baby becomes jaundiced. The jaundice is\napparent from the yellowish tone of the baby’s eyes andskin. If hyperbilirubinemia cannot be controlled, thebaby develops kernicterus. The term kernicterus meansthat bilirubin is being deposited in the brain, possiblycausing permanent damage.\nOther symptoms that may be present include high\nlevels of insulin and low blood sugar, as well as a condi-tion called hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is character-ized by an accumulation of fluids within the baby’s body,giving it a swollen appearance. This fluid accumulationinhibits normal breathing, because the lungs cannotexpand fully and may contain fluid. If this condition con-tinues for an extended period, it can interfere with lunggrowth. Hydrops fetalis and anemia can also contributeto heart problems.\nDiagnosis\nErythroblastosis fetalis can be predicted before birth\nby determining the mother’s blood type.

If the father is Rh-positive, the mother’s\nblood will be checked for antibodies against the Rh fac-tor. A test that demonstrates no antibodies is repeated atweek 26 or 27 of the pregnancy. If antibodies are present,treatment is begun.\nIn cases in which incompatibility is not identified\nbefore birth, the baby suffers recognizable characteristicsymptoms such as anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, andhydrops fetalis. The blood incompatibility is uncoveredthrough blood tests such as the Coombs test, which mea-sures the level of maternal antibodies attached to thebaby’s red blood cells. Other blood tests reveal anemia,abnormal blood counts, and high levels of bilirubin.\nTreatment\nWhen a mother has antibodies against her unborn\ninfant’s blood, the pregnancy is watched very carefully.The antibodies are monitored and if levels increase,amniocentesis , fetal umbilical cord blood sampling, and\nultrasound are used to assess any effects on the baby.Trouble is indicated by high levels of bilirubin in theamniotic fluid or baby’s blood, or if the ultrasound\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1229Erythroblastosis fetalisGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1229reveals hydrops fetalis. If the baby is in danger, and the\npregnancy is at least 32–34 weeks along, labor isinduced. Under 32 weeks, the baby is given blood trans-fusions while still in the mother’s uterus.\nThere are two techniques that are used to deliver a\nblood transfusion to a baby before birth. In the first, a\nneedle is inserted through the mother’s abdomen anduterus, and into the baby’s abdomen. Red blood cellsinjected into the baby’s abdominal cavity are absorbedinto its bloodstream. In early pregnancy or if the baby’sbilirubin levels are gravely high, cordocentesis is per-formed. This procedure involves sliding a very fine nee-dle through the mother’s abdomen and, guided by ultra-sound, into a vein in the umbilical cord to inject redblood cells directly into the baby’s bloodstream.\nAfter birth, the severity of the baby’s symptoms are\nassessed. One or more transfusions may be necessary totreat anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and bleeding. Hyper-bilirubinemia is also treated with phototherapy , a treat-\nment in which the baby is placed under a special light.This light causes changes in how the bilirubin moleculeis shaped, which makes it easier to excrete. The babymay also receive oxygen and intravenous fluids contain-ing electrolytes or drugs to treat other symptoms.\nPrognosis\nIn many cases of blood type incompatibility, the\nsymptoms of erythroblastosis fetalis are prevented withcareful monitoring and blood type screening. Treatmentof minor symptoms is typically successful and the babywill not suffer long-term problems.\nNevertheless, erythroblastosis is a very serious con-\ndition for approximately 4,000 babies annually. In about15% of cases, the baby is severely affected and diesbefore birth. Babies who survive pregnancy may developkernicterus, which can lead to deafness, speech prob-lems, cerebral palsy , or mental retardation . Extended\nhydrops fetalis can inhibit lung growth and contribute toheart failure . These serious complications are life\nthreatening, but with good medical treatment, the fatalityrate is very low. According to the U.S. Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention, there were 21 infant deathsin the United States during 1996 that were attributable tohemolytic disease (erythroblastosis fetalis) and jaundice.\nPrevention\nWith any pregnancy, whether it results in a live birth,\nmiscarriage ,stillbirth , or abortion, blood typing is a\nuniversal precaution against blood compatibility disease.Blood types cannot be changed, but adequate forewarn-ing allows precautions and treatments that limit the dan-ger to unborn babies.If an Rh-negative woman gives birth to an Rh-posi-\ntive baby, she is given an injection of immunoglobulin G,a type of antibody protein, within 72 hours of the birth.The immunoglobulin destroys any fetal blood cells in herbloodstream before her immune system can react tothem. In cases where this precaution is not taken, anti-bodies are created and future pregnancies may be com-plicated.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPhibbs, Roderic H. “Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (Ery-\nthroblastosis Fetalis).” In Rudolph’s Pediatric , ed.

An advanced rate doesn’t diagnose\na specific disease, but it does indicate that an underlyingdisease may be present.\nA physician can use ESR to monitor a person with an\nassociated disease. When the disease worsens, the ESRincreases; when the disease improves, the ESR decreases.The ESR doesn’t always follow the course of cancer.\nESR is called an acute-phase reactant test, meaning\nthat it reacts to acute conditions in the body, such asinfection or trauma. The rate increase follows a rise intemperature and white blood cells count, peaks after sev-eral days, and usually lasts longer than the elevated tem-perature or white blood cells count.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1230Erythrocyte sedimentation rateGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1230Precautions\nThe ESR should not be used to screen healthy per-\nsons for disease.\nDescription\nThe ESR test is a simple test dating back to the\nancient Greeks. A specific amount of diluted, unclottedblood is placed in a special narrow tube and left undis-turbed for exactly one hour. The red cells settle towardsthe bottom of the tube, and the pale yellow liquid (plas-ma) rises to the top. After 60 minutes, measurements aretaken of the distance the red cells traveled to settle at thebottom of the tube. Two methods, the Westergren and theWintrobe, are used by laboratories; each method pro-duces slightly different results. Most laboratories use theWestergren method.\nNormally red cells don’t settle far toward the bottom\nof the tube. Many diseases make extra or abnormal pro-teins that cause the red cells to move close together, stackup, and form a column (rouleaux). In a group, red cellsare heavier and fall faster. The faster they fall, the furtherthey settle, and the higher the ESR.\nThe ESR test is covered by insurance when medical-\nly necessary. Results are usually available the same orfollowing day.\nPreparation\nThis test requires 7mL–10 mL of blood. A health-\ncare worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s upper arm,locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts aneedle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube.

    "content": "Erythromycins\nDefinition\nErythromycins are medicines that kill bacteria or\nprevent their growth.\nPurpose\nErythromycins are antibiotics , medicines used to\ntreat infections caused by microorganisms. Physicians\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1231ErythromycinsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1231prescribe these drugs for many types of infections caused\nby bacteria, including strep throat , sinus infections,\npneumonia , ear infections, tonsillitis ,bronchitis ,gon-\norrhea ,pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and urinary\ntract infections. Some medicines in this group are alsoused to treat Legionnaires’ disease and ulcers caused by\nbacteria. These drugs will notwork for colds, flu, and\nother infections caused by viruses.\nDescription\nThe drugs described here include erythromycins\n(Erythrocin, Ery-C, E-Mycin, and other brands) andmedicines that are chemically related to erythromycins,such as azithromycin (Zithromax) and clarithromycin(Biaxin). They are available only with a physician’s pre-scription and are sold in capsule, tablet (regular andchewable), liquid, and injectable forms.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\nerythromycin, the strength of the medicine, and the med-ical problem for which it is being taken. Check with thephysician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription for the correct dosage.\nAlways take erythromycins exactly as directed.\nNever take larger, smaller, more frequent, or less fre-quent doses. To make sure the infection clears up com-pletely, it is very important to take the medicine for aslong as it has been prescribed. Do not stop taking thedrug just because symptoms begin to improve. This isimportant with all types of infections, but it is especiallyimportant in “strep” infections, which can lead to seriousheart problems if they are not cleared up completely.\nErythromycins work best when they are at constant\nlevels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take themedicine in doses spaced evenly through the day andnight. Do not miss any doses. Some of these medicinesare most effective when taken with a full glass of wateron an empty stomach, but they may be taken with food ifstomach upset is a problem. Others work equally wellwhen taken with or without food. Check package direc-tions or ask the physician or pharmacist for instructionson how to take the medicine.\nPrecautions\nSymptoms should begin to improve within a few\ndays of beginning to take this medicine. If they do not, orif they get worse, check with the physician who pre-scribed the medicine.\nErythromycins may cause mild diarrhea , that usual-\nly goes away during treatment. However, severe diarrheacould be a sign of a very serious side effect .Anyone who\ndevelops severe diarrhea while taking erythromycin orrelated drugs should stop taking the medicine and call aphysician immediately.\nSpecial conditions\nTaking erythromycins may cause problems for peo-\nple with certain medical conditions or people who aretaking certain other medicines. Before taking thesedrugs, be sure to let the physician know about any ofthese conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\nto erythromycins, azithromycin, or clarithromycin in thepast should let his or her physician know before takingthe drugs again. The physician should also be told aboutany allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other sub-\nstances.\nPREGNANCY. Some medicines in this group may\ncause problems in pregnant women and have the poten-tial to cause birth defects . Women who are pregnant or\nwho may become pregnant should check with theirphysicians before taking these drugs.\nBREASTFEEDING. Erythromycins pass into breast\nmilk. Mothers who are breastfeeding and who need totake this medicine should check with their physicians.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ery-\nthromycins, people with any of these medical problemsshould make sure their physicians are aware of their con-ditions:\n• heart disease• liver disease\n• hearing loss\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking erythromycins\nwith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.\nSide effects\nThe most common side effects are mild diarrhea,\nnausea, vomiting, and stomach or abdominal cramps.These problems usually go away as the body adjusts tothe drug and do not require medical treatment. Less com-mon side effects, such as sore mouth or tongue and vagi-nal itching and discharge also may occur and do not need\nmedical attention unless they persist or are bothersome.\nMore serious side effects are not common, but may\noccur. If any of the following side effects occur, checkwith a physician immediately:\n• severe stomach pain , nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1232ErythromycinsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1232•fever\n• skin rash, redness, or itching• unusual tiredness or weakness\nAlthough rare, very serious reactions to azithromycin\n(Zithromax) are possible, including extreme swelling ofthe lips, face, and neck, and anaphylaxis (a violent aller-\ngic reaction). Anyone who develops these symptoms aftertaking azithromycin should stop taking the medicine andget immediate medical help.\nOther rare side effects may occur with erythromycins\nand related drugs. Anyone who has unusual symptomsafter taking these medicines should get in touch with hisor her physician.\nInteractions\nErythromycins may interact with many other medi-\ncines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of thedrugs may change or the risk of side effects may be greater.Anyone who takes erythromycins should let the physicianknow all other medicines he or she is taking. Among thedrugs that may interact with erythromycins are:\n• acetaminophen (Tylenol)• medicine for overactive thyroid\n• male hormones (androgens)\n• female hormones (estrogens)• other antibioticsKEY TERMS\nBronchitis —Inflammation of the air passages of the\nlungs.\nGonorrhea —A sexually transmitted disease (STD)\nthat causes infection in the genital organs and maycause disease in other parts of the body.\nInflammation —Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\nthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.\nLegionnaire’s disease —A lung disease caused by a\nbacterium.\nMicroorganism —An organism that is too small to\nbe seen with the naked eye.\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) —Inflammation\nof the female reproductive tract, caused by any ofseveral microorganisms.

    "content": "Erythropoietin test\nDefinition\nErythropoietin, also called EPO, is a type of protein\ncalled a glycoprotein that is formed mainly in the kid-neys to stimulate the production of red blood cells.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1233Erythropoietin testGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1233Purpose\nThe erythropoietin (EPO) test is used to determine if\nhormonal secretion is causing changes in the red bloodcells. The test has great value in evaluating low hemoglo-bin (anemia), and another disorder called polycythemia,in which unusually large numbers of red blood cells arefound in the blood. The EPO test is also used to identifykidney tumors and to evaluate abuse by athletes whobelieve commercially prepared erythropoietin enhancesperformance.\nPrecautions\nNot every laboratory is equipped to evaluate EPO,\nso the reference laboratory (a large commercial lab thatdoes tests for hospitals not equipped to do them) per-forming the test may require as many as four days tocomplete the analysis. It should also be noted that EPOvalues increase in pregnancy , in which significantly\nhigher levels are found before the twenty-fourth week.\nDescription\nErythropoietin is produced primarily in the kidneys\nbut interacts with other factors in the bone marrow toincrease red cell production. EPO is unique among theblood cell growth factors, because it is the only one thatbehaves like a hormone.\nErythropoietin acts as the principal regulator in the\nproduction of red blood cells (erythrocytes) by control-ling the number, the kinds, and the survival of the cells.Because of this ability, it is being investigated for use inKEY TERMS\nAnemia —A condition in which the hemoglobin\nconcentration in the blood is below normal.\nPolycythemia vera —A condition characterized by\nan unusually large number of red blood cells inthe blood due to increased production by thebone marrow. Symptoms include headaches,blurred vision, high blood pressure, dizziness, andnight sweats.\nSecondary polycythemia —Secondary polycythe-\nmia occurs when the excess of red blood cells iscaused by a condition other than polycythemiavera. For example, when low levels of oxygen in theblood stimulate the bone marrow to produce morered blood cells, as in chronic lung disease.cancer patients to prevent anemia (hemoglobin concen-\ntration in the blood is lower than normal), or to treat ane-mia that has been induced by chemotherapy and bone\nmarrow transplantation (BMT).\nThe correction of anemia can result in reduced\ntransfusion requirements, so the erythropoietin test is\nused to diagnose anemia, including the anemia of end-stage renal disease. Erythropoietin determination is alsovaluable in diagnosing a condition known as poly-cythemia, when increased numbers of red blood cellsoccur. Levels of erythropoietin are extremely low inpolycythemia vera but are normal or high in secondary\npolycythemia . It happens rarely, but cysts in the liver or\nkidneys, as well as tumors in the kidneys or brain, canalso produce erythropoietin. Patients with these condi-tions can have high levels of erythropoietin and maydevelop secondary polycythemia.\nSome athletes use EPO to enhance performance, as\nthe increased red cell volume adds more oxygen-carryingcapacity to the blood. Adverse reactions to this practicecan include clotting abnormalities, headache , seizures,\nhigh blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , and rash.\nPreparation\nThe EPO test requires a blood sample. The patient is\nto fast with nothing to eat or drink for at least eight hoursbefore the test. It is also suggested that the patient liedown for 30 minutes before the test.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, and hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\nNormal results\nReference values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\nbut a general normal range is 11–48 mU/ml (milliunitsper milliliter).\nAbnormal results\nLow levels of EPO are found in anemic patients with\ninadequate or absent production of erythropoietin.Severe kidney disease may decrease production of EPO,and congenital absence of EPO can occur.\nElevated levels of EPO can be found in some ane-\nmias when the body tries to overcompensate for reduced\nblood volume. Elevated levels are also seen in poly-cythemia, and erythropoietin-secreting tumors.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1234Erythropoietin testGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1234Resources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

    "title": "Escherichia coli",
    "content": "Escherichia coli\nDefinition\nE. coli (Escherichia coli) is one of several types of\nbacteria that normally inhabit the intestine of humansand animals (commensal organism). Some strains of E.\ncoli are capable of causing disease under certain condi-\ntions when the immune system is compromised or dis-ease may result from an environmental exposure.\nDescription\nE. coli bacteria may give rise to infections in\nwounds , the urinary tract, biliary tract, and abdominal\ncavity ( peritonitis ). This organism may cause sep-\nticemia, neonatal meningitis , infantile gastroenteritis ,\ntourist diarrhea , and hemorrhagic diarrhea. An E. coli\ninfection may also arise due to environmental exposure.Infections with this type of bacteria pose a serious threatto public health with outbreaks arising from food andwater that has been contaminated with human or animalfeces or sewage. This type of bacteria has been used as abiological indicator for safety of drinking water since the1890s. Exposure may also occur during hospitalization,resulting in pneumonia in immunocompromised\npatients or those on a ventilator\nCauses and symptoms\nThe symptoms of infection and resulting complica-\ntions are dependent upon the strain of E. coli and the site\nof infection. These bacteria produce toxins that have awide range of effects. Symptoms caused by some E. coli\ninfections range from mild to severe, bloody diarrhea,acute abdominal pain , vomiting, and fever . Gastroin-\ntestinal complications that can cause E. coli infections\ninclude irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ischemic coli-\ntis,appendicitis , perforation of the large bowel, and insome instances gangrene in the colon. Other known E.\ncoli-causing infections may include chronic renal failure,\npancreatitis , and diabetes mellitus . Some neurological\nsymptoms such as drowsiness, seizure and coma may\noccur. In infants, E. coli infections are present in cases of\ninfantile gastroenteritis and neonatal meningitis.\nStrains of E. coli that produce diarrhea were initially\ndistinguished by their O (somatic) antigens found on thebacterial surface. Although there is an overlap in charac-teristics between strains, they may be classified into fourmain groups; enterohemorrahagic (0157),enteropatho-genic (055,0111), enterotoxigenic (06,078), andenteroinvasive (0124,0164).\nE.coli O157 (VTEC)\nThe O157:H7 strain is the member of the group most\noften associated with a particularly severe form of diar-rhea. (The O indicates the somatic antigen, while the Hdenotes the flagellar antigen, both of which are found onthe cell surface of the bacteria.) The bacterium was dis-covered in 1977, and first reports of infections followed in1982. E. coli O157:H7, as it is frequently referred to by\nresearchers, causes bloody diarrhea in many infectedpatients. It accounts for about 2% of all cases of diarrheain the western world, and at least one-third of cases ofhemorrhagic colitis, or about 20,000 cases per year\nE. coli O157:H7 is also the most common cause of\nunique syndromes, known as the Hemolytic-Uremic\nSyndrome (HUS) and thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),\nwhich causes kidney failure, hemolytic anemia , and\nthrombocytopenia . Usually, infection with this strain of\nbacteria will subside without further complications.However, about 5% of people who are infected willdevelop HUS/TTP. This infection also accounts for themajority of episodes of HUS, especially in children.\nThis strain of bacteria produces a potent toxin called\nverotoxin, named for toxin’s ability to kill green monkeykidney or “vero” cells. Bacteria that produce verotoxinare referred to as Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC).\nThe numbers of bacteria that are necessary to reproduceinfectious levels of bacteria are quite small, estimated at10-100 viable bacteria. These toxins are lethal for intesti-nal cells and those that line vessels (endothelial cells),inhibiting protein synthesis causing cell death . It is\nbelieved that the damage to blood vessels results in theformation of clots, which eventually leads to theHemolytic-Uremic Syndrome. HUS/TTP is a serious,often fatal, syndrome that has other causes in addition toE. coli O157:H7; it is characterized by the breaking up of\nred blood cells (hemolysis) and kidney failure (uremia).The syndrome occurs most often in the very young andvery old.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1235Escherichia coliGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1235E. coli O157:H7 is commonly found in cattle and\npoultry, and outbreaks have of disease have been associ-ated with cattle and bovine products. There are reports ofcontamination from unpasteurized apple juice, hamburg-er meat, radish sprouts, lettuce, and potatoes, as well asother food sources. Environmental contamination mayoccur in water drained from cattle pastures or water con-taining human sewage used for drinking or swimming.Human to human transmission, through contact withfecal matter, has also been identified in daycare centers.\nAfter an incubation period of three to four days on\naverage, watery diarrhea begins, which rapidly progressesto bloody diarrhea in many victims, in which case thebowel movement may be mostly blood. Nausea, vomit-ing, and low-grade fever are also frequently present. Gas-trointestinal symptoms last for about one week, andrecovery is often spontaneous. Symptomatic infectionmay occur in about 10% of infected individuals. About 5-10% of individuals, usually at the extremes of age or ele-vated leukocyte count, develop HUS/TTP, and ultimately,kidney failure. Patients taking antibiotics or medications\nfor gastric acidity may also be at risk. Neurological symp-toms can also occur as part of HUS/TTP and consist ofseizures, paralysis , and coma. Rectal prolapse may also\nbe a complication, and in some cases colitis, appendicitis,perforation of the large bowel, and gangrene in the bowel.Systemically, the most prevalent complications of E. coli\n157 infections are HUS and TTP.\nE. coli non-O157 (VTEC)\nThese strains of E. coli produce verotoxin, but are\nstrains other than O157. There have been as many as onehundred different types implicated in the development ofdisease. Strain OH111 was found to be involved in out-\nbreaks in Australia, Japan, and Italy. The O128, O103,and O55 groups have also been implicated in diarrheaoutbreaks. In Britain, cases of infantile gastroenteritis inmaternity hospitals and neonatal units have been attrib-uted to the E. coli non-0157 group. Many of these organ-\nisms have been identified in cattle.\nEnterotoxigenic E. coli\nTwo toxins may be produced by this group, the heat-\nlabile enterotoxin (LT) that can produce enteritis ininfants, and a heat stable enterotoxin (ST), the action ofwhich has yet to be determined.\nEnteroinvasive E. coli\nSome strains of the enteroinvasive E. coli have been\ninvolved in the development of gastroenteritis in infants.These organisms do not produce and enterotoxin. Thecells of the intestine are affected, with the developmentof symptoms that are typical of a shigellae infection.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of a specific type of infection is depen-\ndant upon the characteristics of the particular strain ofthe organism.\nE. coli O157:H7 (HUS)\nThis particular strain of E. coli is suspected when\nbloody diarrhea, bloody stools, lack of fever, elevatedleukocyte count, and abdominal tenderness are present.Stool cultures are used to tentatively identify the bacteria.Unfortunately, cultures are often negative or inconclusiveif done after 48 hours of symptoms. Further tests are usu-ally needed, however, for confirmation of infection. Thismay include a full blood count , blood film, and tests to\ndetermine urea, electrolyte, and LDH (lactate dehydroge-nase) levels. Damaged red blood cells, and elevated levelsof creatinine, urea, and LDH with a drop in platelet\ncount may indicate that HUS will develop. Immunomag-\nnetic separation is now being used for diagnosis as well.\nE. coli non-O157 (VTEC)\nDiagnosis is often difficult for these types of bacteria,\nbut production of enterohemolysin (Ehly) is used as anindicator. Other diagnostic tests are used to detect vero-toxins, including ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbentassays), colony immunoblotting, and DNA-based tests.\nE. coli 0157 STEC\nMethods for detection of this type of bacteria are\nunder development, including culture growth media\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1236Escherichia coli\nA magnified image of the E. coli bacterium.

Immunomagnetic separation\nand specific ELISA, latex agglutination tests, colonyimmunoblot assays, and other immunological-baseddetection methods are being explored.\nTreatment\nUncomplicated cases of the E. coli O157:H7 the\ninfection clear up within ten days. It is not certain thatantibiotics are helpful in treating E. coli O157:H7 and\nthere is some evidence that they may be harmful. Dehy-\ndration resulting from diarrhea must be treated with either\nOral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids.Anti-motility agents that decrease the intestines’ ability tocontract, should not be used in any patient with bloodydiarrhea. Treatment of HUS, if it develops, involves cor-rection of clotting factors, plasma exchange, and kidney\ndialysis . Blood transfusions may be required. Treatment\nmethods for other E. coli infections are similar. Antibiotics\nare often used in the treatment of E. coli infections, but\ntheir role is controversial. Some antibiotics may enhancethe development of HUS/TTP depending upon theiraction, as well as the use of anti diarrhea medications thatshould be avoided. Phosphoenolpyruvate analogues maybe helpful. Gentamicin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, or beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin may be administered forneonatal meningitis. Antibiotic therapy is further compli-cated by the presence of antibiotic resistant organisms.\nAlternative treatment\nStudies have been conducted to determine if diar-\nrhea symptoms can be reduced by alternative therapiessuch as the consumption of herbal teas, psyllium, andacupuncture . Patients should consult their doctors\nbefore using any alternative treatments, as E. coli can be\nlife threatening and should be closely monitored.\nPrognosis\nIn most cases of O157:H7, symptoms last for about a\nweek and recovery is often spontaneous. Ten percent ofindividuals with E. coli O157:H7 infection develop HUS;\n5% of those will die of the disease. Some who recoverfrom HUS will be left with some degree of kidney dam-age and possibly irritable bowel syndrome. Additionally,there is a possibility of chronic E. coli infection.\nInfants that develop E. coli infections may be perma-\nnently affected.

The enforcement ofregulations for meat production and water are critical.Steam pasteurization is used in the United States and isbeing explored in other countries.\nPrevention of E. coli gastroenteritis in infants is best\nachieved by breast-feeding. The breast milk contains anti-bodies that combat the infection. For bottle-fed infants,care should be taken in the preparation of the milk andbottles.

    "title": "Esophageal atresia",
    "content": "Esophageal atresia\nDefinition\nEsophageal atresia is a serious birth defect in which\nthe esophagus, the long tube that connects the mouth tothe stomach, is segmented and closed off at any point.This condition usually occurs with tracheoesophageal\nfistula , a condition in which the esophagus is improperly\nattached to the trachea, the nearby tube that connects thenasal area to the lungs. Esophageal atresia occurs inapproximately 1 in 4,000 live births.\nDescription\nFailure of an unborn child (fetus) to develop proper-\nly results in birth defects . Many of these defects involve\norgans that do not function, or function only incidentally,before birth, and, as a result, go undetected until the babyis born. In this case, the digestive tract is unnecessary forfetal growth, since all nutrition comes from the mother\nthrough the placenta and umbilical cord.\nDuring fetal development, the esophagus and the tra-\nchea arise from the same original tissue. Normally, thetwo tubes would form separately (differentiate); howev-er, in cases of esphageal atresia and tracheoesophagealfistulas, they do not, resulting in various malformed con-figurations. The most common configuration is the “C”type, in which the upper part of the esophagus abruptlyends in a blind pouch, while the lower part attaches itselfto the trachea. This configuration occurs in 85–90% ofcases. Esophageal atresia without involvement of the tra-chea occurs in only 8% of cases.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of esophageal atresia, like that of most\nbirth defects, is unknown.\nAn infant born with this defect will at first appear all\nright, swallowing normally. However, the blind pouchwill begin to fill with mucus and saliva that would nor-mally pass through the esophagus to the stomach. Thesesecretions back up into the mouth and nasal area, causingthe baby to drool excessively. When fed, the baby willalso immediately regurgitate what he or she has eaten.Choking and coughing may also occur as the baby\nbreaths in the fluid backing up from the esophagus. Aspi-ration pneumonia , an infection of the respiratory system\ncaused by inhalation of the contents of the digestive tract,may also develop.\nDiagnosis\nPhysicians who suspect esophageal atresia after\nbeing presented with the above symptoms diagnose thecondition using x-ray imaging or by passing a catheterthrough the nose and into the esophagus. Esophagealatresia is indicated if the catheter hits an obstruction 4–5in (10–13 cm) from the nostrils.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1238Esophageal atresiaGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1238Treatment\nInfants with esophageal atresia are unlikely to survive\nwithout surgery to reconnect the esophagus. The procedureis done as soon as possible; however, prematurity , the\npresence of other birth defects, or complications of apira-tion pneumonia may delay surgery. Once diagnosed, thebaby will be fed intraveneously until he or she has recov-ered sufficiently from the operation. Mucus and saliva willalso be continuously removed via a catheter until recoveryhas occured. When surgery is performed, the esophagus isreconnected and, if neccessary, separated from the trachea.If the two ends of the esophagus are too far apart to be reat-tached, tissue from the large intestine is used to join them.\nPrognosis\nSurgery to correct esophageal atresia is usually suc-\ncessful. Post-operative complications may include diffi-culty swallowing, since the esophagus may not contractefficiently, and gastrointestinal reflux, in which theacidic contents of stomach back up into the lower part ofthe esophagus, possibly causing ulcers.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Atresia and Tracheoesophageal Fistula.” In Nelson Textbook of\nPediatrics , ed.

    "title": "Esophageal cancer",
    "content": "Esophageal cancer\nDefinition\nEsophageal cancer is a malignancy that develops\nin tissues of the hollow, muscular canal (esophagus)KEY TERMS\nFetal —Refers to the fetus, also known in the first\ntwo months after conception as an embryo.\nFistula —Unnatural connection between two hol-\nlow organs or one organ and the outside.along which food and liquid travel from the throat to\nthe stomach.\nDescription\nEsophageal cancer usually originates in the inner\nlayers of the lining of the esophagus and grows outward.In time, the tumor can obstruct the passage of food andliquid, making swallowing painful and difficult. Sincemost patients are not diagnosed until the late stages ofthe disease, esophageal cancer is associated with poorquality of life and low survival rates.\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the most common type\nof esophageal cancer, accounting for 95% of allesophageal cancers worldwide. The esophagus is nor-mally lined with thin, flat squamous cells that resembletiny roof shingles . Squamous cell carcinoma can develop\nat any point along the esophagus but is most common inthe middle portion.\nAdenocarcinoma has surpassed squamous cell carci-\nnoma as the most common type of esophageal cancer inthe United States. Adenocarcinoma originates in glandu-lar tissue not normally present in the lining of the esoph-agus. Before adenocarcinoma can develop, glandularcells must replace a section of squamous cells. Thisoccurs in Barrett’s esophagus, a precancerous conditionin which chronic acid reflux from the stomach stimulatesa transformation in cell type in the lower portion of theesophagus.\nA very small fraction of esophageal cancers are\nmelanomas, sarcomas , or lymphomas.\nThere is great variability in the incidence of\nesophageal cancer with regard to geography, ethnicity,and gender. The overall incidence is increasing. About13,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed inthe United States each year. During the same 12-monthperiod, 12,000 people die of this disease. It strikesbetween five and ten North Americans per 100,000. Insome areas of China the cancer is endemic.\nSquamous cell carcinoma usually occurs in the sixth\nor seventh decade of life, with a greater incidence inAfrican-Americans than in others. Adenocarcinomadevelops earlier and is much more common in whitepatients. In general, esophageal cancer occurs more fre-quently in men than in women.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown,\nalthough many investigators believe that chronic irrita-tion of the esophagus is a major culprit. Most of the iden-tified risk factors represent a form of chronic irritation.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1239Esophageal cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1239However, the wide variance in the distribution of\nesophageal cancer among different demographic groupsraises the possibility that genetic factors also play a role.\nSeveral risk factors are associated with esophageal\ncancer.\n• Tobacco and alcohol consumption are the major risk\nfactors, especially for squamous cell carcinoma. Smok-\ningand alcohol abuse each increase the risk of squa-\nmous cell carcinoma by five-fold. The effects of thetwo are synergistic, in that the combination of smokingand alchohol increases the risk by 25- to 100- fold. It isestimated that drinking about 13 ounces of alcoholevery day for an extended period of time raises the riskof developing esophageal cancer by 18%. That likeli-hood increases to 44% in individuals who also smokeone or two packs of cigarettes a day. Smokeless tobaccoalso increases the risk for esophageal cancer.\n• Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which acid\nfrom the stomach refluxes backwards into the lowerportion of the esophagus, sometimes causing symptomsof heartburn . In some cases of gastroesophageal\nreflux, the chronic exposure to acid causes the inner lin-ing of the lower esophagus to change from squamouscells to glandular cells. This is called Barrett’s esopha-gus. Patients with Barrett’s esophagus are roughly 30 to40 times more likely than the general population todevelop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.\n• A diet low in fruits, vegetables, zinc, riboflavin, and\nother vitamins can increase risk of developing to\nesophageal cancer.\n• Caustic injury to the esophagus inflicted by swallowing\nlye or other substances that damage esophageal cells canlead to the development of squamous cell esophagealcancer in later life.\n• Achalasia is a condition in which the lower esophageal\nsphincter (muscle) cannot relax enough to let food passinto the stomach. Squamous cell esophageal cancerdevelops in about 6% of patients with achalasia.\n• Tylosis is a rare inherited disease characterized by\nexcess skin on the palms and soles. Affected patientshave a much higher probability of developingesophageal cancer than the general population. Theyshould have regular screenings to detect the disease inits early, most curable stages.\n• Esophageal webs, which are protrusions of tissue into\nthe esophagus, and diverticula, which are outpouchingsof the wall of the esophagus, are associated with a high-er incidence of esophageal cancer.Symptoms\nUnfortunately, symptoms generally don’t appear\nuntil the tumor has grown so large that the patient cannotbe cured. Dysphagia (trouble swallowing or a sensationof having food stuck in the throat or chest) is the mostcommon symptom. Swallowing problems may occuroccasionally at first, and patients often react by eatingmore slowly and chewing their food more carefully and,as the tumor grows, switching to soft foods or a liquiddiet. Without treatment, the tumor will eventually pre-vent even liquid from passing into the stomach. A sensa-tion of burning or slight mid-chest pressure is a rare,often-disregarded symptom of esophageal cancer.Painful swallowing is usually a symptom of a largetumor obstructing the opening of the esophagus. It canlead to regurgitation of food, weight loss, physical wast-ing, and malnutrition . Anyone who has trouble swal-\nlowing, loses a significant amount of weight withoutdieting, or cannot eat solid food because it is too painfulto swallow should see a doctor.\nDiagnosis\nA barium swallow is usually the first test performed\non a patient whose symptoms suggest esophageal cancer.After the patient swallows a small amount of barium, aseries of x rays can highlight any bumps or flat raisedareas on the normally smooth surface of the esophagealwall. It can also detect large, irregular areas that narrowthe esophagus in patients with advanced cancer, but it can-not provide information about disease that has spreadbeyond the esophagus. A double contrast study is a bariumswallow with air blown into the esophagus to improve theway the barium coats the esophageal lining. Endoscopy isa diagnostic procedure in which a thin lighted tube (endo-scope) is passed through the mouth, down the throat, andinto the esophagus. Cells that appear abnormal areremoved for biopsy. Once a diagnosis of esophageal can-cer has been confirmed through biopsy, staging tests areperformed to determine whether the disease has spread(metastasized) to tissues or organs near the original tumoror in other parts of the body. These tests may include com-puted tomography, endoscopic ultrasound, thoracoscopy ,\nlaparoscopy , and positron emission tomography .\nTreatment\nTreatment for esophageal cancer is determined by the\nstage of the disease and the patient’s general health. Themost important distinction to make is whether the canceris curable. If the cancer is in the early stages, cure may bepossible. If the cancer is advanced or if the patient willnot tolerate major surgery, treatment is usually directed atpalliation (relief of symptoms only) instead of cure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1240Esophageal cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1240Staging\nStage 0 is the earliest stage of the disease. Cancer\ncells are confined to the innermost lining of the esopha-gus. Stage I esophageal cancer has spread slightly deep-er, but still has not extended to nearby tissues, lymphnodes, or other organs. In Stage IIA, cancer has invadedthe thick, muscular layer of the esophagus that propelsfood into the stomach and may involve connective tissuecovering the outside of the esophagus. In Stage IIB, can-cer has spread to lymph nodes near the esophagus andmay have invaded deeper layers of esophageal tissue.Stage III esophageal cancer has spread to tissues orlymph nodes near the esophagus or to the trachea (wind-pipe) or other organs near the esophagus. Stage IV can-cer has spread to distant organs like the liver, bones, andbrain. Recurrent esophageal cancer is disease that devel-ops in the esophagus or another part of the body after ini-tial treatment.\nSurgery\nThe most common operations for the treatment of\nesophageal cancer are esophagectomy and esophagogas-trectomy. Esophagectomy is the removal of the cancer-ous part of the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes. Thisprocedure is performed only on patients with very earlycancer that has not spread to the stomach. Esophagogas-trectomy is the removal of the cancerous part of theesophagus, nearby lymph nodes, and the upper part ofthe stomach. The resected esophagus is replaced with thestomach or parts of intestine so the patient can swallow.These procedures can significantly relieve symptoms andimprove the nutritional status of more than 80% ofpatients with dysphagia. Although surgery can cure somepatients whose disease has not spread beyond the esoph-agus, but more than 75% of esophageal cancers havespread to other organs before being diagnosed. Lessextensive surgical procedures can be used for palliation.\nChemotherapy\nOral or intravenous chemotherapy alone will not\ncure esophageal cancer, but pre-operative treatments canshrink tumors and increase the probability that cancercan be surgically eradicated. Palliative chemotherapy canrelieve symptoms of advanced cancer but will not alterthe outcome of the disease.\nRadiation\nExternal beam or internal radiation, delivered by\nmachine or implanted near cancer cells inside the body,is only rarely used as the primary form of treatment.Post-operative radiation is sometimes used to kill cancercells that couldn’t be surgically removed. Palliative radi-ation is effective in relieving dysphagia in patients who\ncannot be cured. However, radiation is most useful whencombined with chemotherapy as either the definitivetreatment or preoperative treatment.\nPalliation\nIn addition to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation,\nother palliative measures can provide symptomatic relief.Dilatation of the narrowed portion of the esophagus withsoft tubes can provide short-term relief of dysphagia. Place-ment of a flexible, self-expanding stent within the narrowedportion is also useful in allowing more food intake.\nFollow-up treatments\nRegular barium swallows and other imaging studies\nare necessary to detect recurrence or spread of disease ornew tumor development.\nAlternative treatment\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) involves intravenously\ninjecting a drug that is absorbed by cancer cells and killsthem after they are exposed to specific laser beams. PDTcan be used for palliation, but it also cured some earlyesophageal cancers during preliminary studies.Researchers are comparing its benefits with those ofmore established therapies.\nEndoscopic laser therapy involves delivering short,\npowerful laser treatments to the tumor through an endo-scope. It can improve dysphagia, but multiple treatmentsare required, and the benefit is seldom long-lasting.\nPrognosis\nSince most patients are diagnosed when the cancer\nhas spread to lymph nodes or other structures, the prog-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1241Esophageal cancer\nA close-up view of a cancerous esophageal tumor.

    "title": "Esophageal function tests",
    "content": "Esophageal function tests\nDefinition\nThe esophagus is the swallowing tube through\nwhich food passes on its way from the mouth to thestomach. The main function of this organ is to propelfood down into the stomach. There is also a mechanismto prevent food from coming back up or “refluxing” fromthe stomach into the esophagus. Esophageal functiontests are used to determine if these processes are normalor abnormal.\nPurpose\nThe esophagus is a long, muscular tube that also has\ntwo muscles (or sphincters) at the top and bottom. All ofthese muscular areas must contract in an exact sequencefor swallowing to proceed normally. There are threemain symptoms that occur when esophageal function isabnormal: difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia), heart-\nburn , and chest pain .\nDoctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate these\nsymptoms. Endoscopy, which is not a test of esophagealfunction, is often used to determine if the lining of theesophagus has any ulcers, tumors, or areas of narrowing(strictures). Many times, however, endoscopy only showsthe doctor if there is injury to the esophageal lining, andthe procedure gives no information about the cause of theproblem.\nTherefore, in addition to endoscopy, several studies\nare available that measure esophageal function. There arethree basic types of tests used to assess esophageal func-tion:\n• Manometry is used to study the way the muscles of the\nesophagus contract, and is most useful for the investi-gation of difficulty with swallowing.\n• Esophageal pH monitoring measures changes in\nesophageal acidity, and is valuable for evaluatingpatients with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis-ease (GERD).\n• X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties. They\neither follow the progress of barium during swallowingusing a fluoroscope, or they use radioactive scanningtechniques.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1242Esophageal function testsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1242Precautions\nPregnant patients undergoing x-ray exams should\ncarefully review the risks and benefits with their doctors.Most x-ray exams of the gastrointestinal tract do notinvolve radiation levels that are harmful to the unborn baby.\nDescription\nManometry\nThis study is designed to measure the pressure\nchanges produced by contraction of the muscular por-tions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function ofany one of the segments of the swallowing tube causesdifficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys-phagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating thosepatients whose endoscopy is negative.\nDuring manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube\ncarrying a device that senses changes in pressures in theesophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal-lowing. Medications are sometimes given during thestudy to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans-mitted to recording equipment. Manometry can bestidentify diseases that produce disturbances of motility orcontractions of the esophagus.\nEsophageal pH monitoring\nThis procedure involves measuring the esophagus’\nexposure to acid that has “refluxed” from the stomach.The test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn orGERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, butalso ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing(strictures) when they heal.\nNormally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only\nsmall amounts for short periods of time. A muscle calledthe lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux.Spontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp-tying and production of saliva are other important protec-tive mechanisms.\n“pH” is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or\nalkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in theesophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per-sists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has beendesigned to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu-ally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their dailyroutine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point intheir activities they occurred. During this period, a thintube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to recordchanges. After the study, a computer is used to comparechanges in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient.\nSurgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for\nsymptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of manypatients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed\nbefore surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge theeffects of drug therapy.\nX-ray tests\nThese fall into two categories: (1) those done with\nthe use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per-formed with radioactive materials.\nStudies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest\nvalue in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph-agus. Although this is not truly an esophageal functiontest, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnosticpossibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coatedwith barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction.\nDuring fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the\npassage of material through the esophagus in real time,and video recordings can also be done. This is particularlyuseful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involvemainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com-mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke ,\nalthough other diseases of the neuromuscular system (likemyasthenia gravis ) can produce the same symptoms.\nScans using low-dose radioactive materials are use-\nful because they are able not only to demonstrate thatfood passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor-mal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow-ing food coated with material that is followed by anuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used whenother methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it isnecessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. Asof 1997, scans mainly served as research tools.\nPreparation\nPatients should not eat or drink for several hours\nbefore the exam. Many medications affect the esopha-gus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or evenstopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of allmedications taken, including over-the-counter medica-tions (purchased without a doctor’s prescription), andany known allergies .\nAftercare\nFor most of these studies, no special care is needed\nafter the procedure. Patients can often go about normaldaily activities following any of these tests. One excep-tion is for those who undergo an x-ray exam with the useof barium. This can have a constipating effect andpatients should ask about using a mild laxative later on.\nRisks\nExposure of a fetus to x rays, especially in the first\nthree months, is a potential risk.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1243Esophageal function testsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1243Other studies of esophageal function are essen-\ntially free of any significant risk. The tubes passedduring these procedures are small, and most patientsadjust to them quite well. However, since medicationscannot be used to relax patients, some may not toleratethe exam.\nAbnormal results\nManometry is used to diagnose abnormalities relat-\ned to contraction or relaxation of the various muscularregions of the esophagus. These studies cannot distin-guish whether injury to either the muscle or nerves of theesophagus is producing the abnormal results. Only thefinal effect on esophageal muscle is identified. Resultsshould be interpreted in light of the patient’s entire med-ical history.\nFor example, there are many diseases that cause\npoor relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Whenno cause is found, the disease is called achalasia .\nAbnormal results of pH tests can confirm symptoms\nof heartburn or indicate a cause of chest pain (or rarely,swallowing difficulties). Doctors may want to start orchange medications based on these results, or even repeatthe test using different doses of medication. As notedabove, these studies are indicated before surgical treat-ment of GERD.\nX-ray tests can only serve to document an abnormal-\nity, and they are far from perfect. If they are negative,then other studies are often needed.\nResources\nBOOKS\nClouse, Ray E., and N. E.

A defect in the wall of the esophagusmay allow the lining to herniate, creating a space wherefood can be caught. Pouches can appear anywherebetween the throat and the stomach. They occur primari-ly in men and usually later in life.\nDifferent names for the condition apply to different\nlocations along the esophagus:\n• Zenker’s diverticula are pharyngeal pouches, or ones\nthat occur in the upper neck area at the top of the esoph-agus.\n•Traction diverticula are a type of mid-esophageal\npouch.\n• Epiphrenic diverticula occur at the bottom of the esoph-\nagus near where it enters the stomach.\nCauses and symptoms\nTo propel food into the stomach (or out of it during\nvomiting) the esophagus generates internal pressure justlike the bowel. Under certain circumstances, that pressurecan herniate the esophageal lining through a weakness inthe wall, creating a pouch (a balloon squeezed in the handwill herniate through the fingers in the same way). Pouch-es are more common in people who have motility disor-ders of the esophagus, swallowing that is not well coordi-nated and may be spastic. A traction diverticulum candevelop from a scar that pulls the esophagus out of shape.Food and saliva can collect in all of these pouches.\nPouches in the neck usually cause bad breath (hali-\ntosis) and the regurgitation of swallowed food and saliva.Some patients with Zenker’s diverticula can push on theirneck and make old food appear in their mouths. Pouchesnear the stomach may cause swallowing problems, condi-tions known as achalasia or dysphagia . Mid-esophageal\npouches usually cause no symptoms.\nIn the most serious cases, a person may be unable to\nswallow because the esophagus is obstructed, or theesphagus may rupture, spilling its contents into the chestor neck.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1244Esophageal pouchesGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1244Diagnosis\nDifficulty swallowing, bad breath, or food reappear-\ning in the back of the mouth are among the signs physi-cians look for when diagnosing this condition. Sometimesthe patient may also experience pain in the chest resem-\nbling a heart attack . A series of x rays taken while swal-\nlowing a contrast agent usually demonstrates the divertic-ulum clearly. An esophagoscopy may also be needed togather more detail. Manometry, measuring pressuresinside the esophagus using a balloon that is passed downit, may help determine the cause of the diverticula.\nTreatment\nTreatment for this condition is primarily aimed at\nalleviating symptoms. Physicians direct the patient to eata bland diet, to chew his or her food thoroughly, and todrink water after eating to clean out the pouches. If thecondition is severe, several types of surgery are availableto remove the pouches and repair the defects. If a pouchis due to a stenosis (narrowing) in the esophagus it maybe possible to relieve it by passing a dilator through it, aprocess called bougeinage.\nPrognosis\nThe two complications that can render these nui-\nsances dangerous, obstruction and rupture, are emergen-cies.

    "content": "Esophagogastroduodenoscopy\nDefinition\nAn endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterolo-\ngy (the medical study of the stomach and intestines) is athin, flexible tube that uses a lens or miniature camera toview various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When theprocedure is limited to the examination of the inside ofthe gastrointestinal tract’s upper portion, it is calledupper endoscopy or esphagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).With the endoscope, the esophagus (swallowing tube),stomach, and duodenum (first portion of the small intes-tine) can be easily examined, and abnormalities frequent-ly treated. Patients are usually sedated during the exam.\nPurpose\nEGD is performed to evaluate or treat symptoms\nrelating to the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as:\n• upper abdominal or chest pain\n• nausea or vomiting\n• difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n• bleeding from the upper intestinal tract\n• anemia (low blood count ). EGD can be used to treat\ncertain conditions, such as an area of narrowing orbleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract\nUpper endoscopy is more accurate than x rays for\ndetecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is used todiagnose early cancer and can frequently determine\nwhether a growth is benign (not cancerous) or malignant(cancerous).Biopsies (small tissue samples) of inflamed or “sus-\npicious” areas can be obtained and examined by a pathol-ogist. Cell scrapings can also be taken by the introduc-tion of a small brush; this helps in the diagnosis of canceror infections.\nWhen treating conditions in the upper gastrointesti-\nnal tract, small instruments are passed through the endo-scope that can stretch narrowed areas (strictures), orremove swallowed objects (such as coins or pins). Inaddition, bleeding from ulcers or vessels can be treatedby a number of endoscopic techniques.\nRecent studies have shown the usefulness of endo-\nscopic removal of early tumors of the esophagus or stom-ach. This is done either with injection of certain materi-als (like alcohol), or with the use of instruments (likelasers) that burn the tumor. Other techniques combiningmedications and lasers also show promise.\nPrecautions\nPatients should inquire as to the doctor’s expertise\nwith these procedures, especially when therapy is themain goal. The doctor should be informed of any aller-\ngies, medication use, and medical problems.\nDescription\nFirst, a “topical” (local) medication to numb the gag\nreflex is given either by spray or is gargled. Patients areusually sedated for the procedure (though not always) byinjection of medications into a vein. The endoscopistthen has the patient swallow the scope, which is passedthrough the upper gastrointestinal tract. The lens or cam-era at the end of the instrument allows the endoscopist toexamine each portion of the upper gastrointestinal tract;photos can be taken for reference. Air is pumped inthrough the instrument to allow proper observation.Biopsies and other procedures can be performed withoutany significant discomfort.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1246EsophagogastroduodenoscopyGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1246Preparation\nThe upper intestinal tract must be empty for the pro-\ncedure, so it is necessary NOT to eat or drink for at least6–12 hours before the exam. Patients need to inquireabout taking their medications before the procedure.\nAftercare\nSomeone should be available to take the person\nhome after the procedure and stay with them for a while;patients will not be able to drive themselves due to seda-\ntion.

The doctor should be notified if thepatient has fever , trouble swallowing, or increasing\nthroat, chest, or abdominal pain.\nRisks\nEGD is safe and well tolerated; however, complica-\ntions can occur as with any procedure. These are mostoften due to medications used during the procedure, or\nare related to endoscopic therapy. The overall complica-tion rate of EGD is less than 2%, and many of these com-plications are minor (such as inflammation of the veinthrough which medication is given). However, seriousones can and do occur, and almost half of them are relat-ed to the heart or lungs. Bleeding or perforations (holesin the gastrointestinal tract) are also reported, especiallywhen tumors or narrowed areas are treated or biopsied.Infections have also been rarely transmitted; improvedcleaning techniques should be able to prevent them.\nResources\nBOOKS\nYoung, Harvey S., and Keeffe, Emmet B. “Complications of\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy.” In Sleisenger & Fordtran’s\nGastrointestinal and Liver Disease , ed.

    "title": "Evoked potential studies",
    "content": "Evoked potential studies\nDefinition\nEvoked potential studies are a group of tests of the\nnervous system that measure electrical signals along thenerve pathways.\nPurpose\nNerves convey information to the body by sending\nelectrical signals down the length of the nerve. These sig-nals can be recorded by wires placed over the nerves onthe surface of the skin, in a procedure called an evokedpotential (EP) study. The person conducting the testevokes the patient’s neural activity by visual or auditorystimulation or using a mild electrical shock. This causeschanges in the electrical potential in the nerves. Analysisof the signals can provide information about the condi-tion of nerve pathways, especially those in the brain andspinal cord. They can indicate the presence of disease ordegeneration, and can help determine the location ofnerve lesions.\nThere are three major types of EP studies used regu-\nlarly:\n• Visual evoked potentials are used to diagnose visual\nlosses due to optic nerve damage, especially from mul-\ntiple sclerosis . They are also useful to diagnose “hys-\nterical blindness,” in which loss of vision is not due toany nerve damage.• Auditory evoked potentials are used to diagnose hearing\nlosses. They can distinguish damage to the acoustic nerve(which carries signals from the ear to the brain stem)from damage to the auditory pathways within the brain-stem. Most auditory EPs record activity from the brain-stem, and are therefore called “brainstem auditory evokedpotentials.” Disorders diagnosed with auditory EPsinclude acoustic neuroma (tumors of the inner ear) and\nmultiple sclerosis (chronic disease in which nerves losepatches of their outer covering). They may also be used toassess high frequency hearing ability, to determine braindeath , and to monitor brainstem function during surgery\n• Somatosensory evoked potentials record transmission of\nnerve impulses from the limbs to the brain, and can beused to diagnose nerve damage or degeneration withinthe spinal cord or nerve roots from multiple sclerosis,trauma, or other degenerative disease. SomatosensoryEPs can be used to distinguish central versus peripheralnerve disease, when combined with results from a nerveconduction velocity test, which measures nerve functionin the extremities.\nPrecautions\nEvoked potential studies are painless, noninvasive,\nand without any significant risk. Somatosensory EP testsinvolve very mild electric shocks, usually felt as a tingling.\nDescription\nThe person performing the test locates and marks\nspecific spots on the patient’s head for placement of elec-trodes. These spots are cleaned, and an adhesive conduct-ing paste is applied. Cup electrodes are attached. Forsomatosensory EP, spots on the arm or leg are alsomarked and cleaned; electrodes may be taped in place.The patient sits or reclines in a chair throughout the tests.\nFor a visual EP, the patient focuses on a TV screen\nwhich displays a checkerboard pattern. The eye not beingtested is covered with a patch. For children or otherswhose attention may wander, goggles are used whichshow the pattern to one eye at a time. Each eye is usuallytested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-ly 30–45 minutes.\nFor auditory EP, headphones are used to deliver a\nseries of clicks to one ear at a time. A masking or staticsound is played into the other ear. Each ear is usuallytested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate-ly 30–45 minutes.\nFor somatosensory EP, mild electrical shocks are\ndelivered to the arm or leg. This may cause some twitch-ing and tingling. The stimulus lasts for about two min-utes at a time, and the entire procedure takes approxi-mately 30 minutes.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1248Evoked potential studiesGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1248After the tests, the electrodes are removed with ace-\ntone and the scalp is cleaned.\nPreparation\nHair must be clean, dry, and free of any braids, pins,\nor jewelry. The patient should shampoo before the test,and must not use any hair spray, gel, or other hair careproducts after shampooing. Clothing should be loose andcomfortable. The patient may eat and take some medica-tions as usual before the test, although sedative medica-tions should be avoided on the day of the test, if possible.It is best to check with the physician supervising the testfor specific instructions.\nAftercare\nThis test is painless and has no residual effects. The\npatient may return to work or other activities immediate-ly afterward.\nNormal results\nEP test results are displayed as jagged electrical\ntracings (wave forms), which have characteristic shapes,heights, and lengths, indicating the speed and intensity ofsignal transmission. Results are read by someone trainedin evoked potential studies.\nAbnormal results\nChanges in the electrical tracings may indicate dam-\nage to or degeneration of nerve pathways to the brainfrom the eyes, ears, or limbs.

    "title": "Exercise",
    "content": "Exercise\nDefinition\nExercise is physical activity that is planned, struc-\ntured, and repetitive for the purpose of conditioning anypart of the body. Exercise is utilized to improve health,maintain fitness and is important as a means of physicalrehabilitation .\nPurpose\nExercise is useful in preventing or treating coronary\nheart disease, osteoporosis , weakness, diabetes, obesity ,\nand depression. Range of motion is one aspect of exerciseimportant for increasing or maintaining joint function.Strengthening exercises provide appropriate resistance tothe muscles to increase endurance and strength. Cardiac\nrehabilitation exercises are developed and individualized\nto improve the cardiovascular system for prevention andrehabilitation of cardiac disorders and diseases. A well-balanced exercise program can improve general health,build endurance, and delay many of the effects of aging .\nThe benefits of exercise not only improve physical health,but also enhance emotional well-being.\nPrecautions\nBefore beginning any exercise program, an evalua-\ntion by a physician is recommended to rule out any poten-tial health risks. Once health and fitness are determined,and any or all physical restrictions identified, an individ-ual’s exercise program should be under the supervision ofa health care professional. This is especially the casewhen exercise is used as a form of rehabilitation. If symp-toms of dizziness , nausea, excessive shortness of breath ,\nor chest pain are present during any exercise program, an\nindividual should stop the activity and inform a physicianabout these symptoms before resuming activity. Exerciseequipment must be checked to determine if it can bear theweight of people of all sizes and shapes.\nDescription\nRange of motion exercise\nRange of motion exercise refers to activity whose\ngoal is improving movement of a specific joint. This\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1249ExerciseGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1249motion is influenced by several structures: configuration\nof bone surfaces within the joint, joint capsule, liga-ments, and muscles and tendons acting on the joint.There are three types of range of motion exercises: pas-sive, active, and active assists. Passive range of motion ismovement applied to a joint solely by another person orpersons or a passive motion machine. When passiverange of motion is applied, the joint of an individualreceiving exercise is completely relaxed while the out-side force moves the body part, such as a leg or arm,throughout the available range. Injury, surgery, or immo-\nbilization of a joint may affect the normal joint range of\nmotion. Active range of motion is movement of a jointprovided entirely by the individual performing the exer-cise. In this case, there is no outside force aiding in themovement. Active assist range of motion is described asa joint receiving partial assistance from an outside force.This range of motion may result from the majority ofmotion applied by an exerciser or by the person or per-sons assisting the individual. It may also be a half-and-half effort on the joint from each source.\nStrengthening exercise\nStrengthening exercise increases muscle strength\nand mass, bone strength, and the body’s metabolism. Itcan help attain and maintain proper weight and improvebody image and self-esteem. A certain level of musclestrength is needed to do daily activities, such as walking,\nrunning and climbing stairs. Strengthening exercisesincrease this muscle strength by putting more strain on amuscle than it is normally accustomed to receiving. Thisincreased load stimulates the growth of proteins insideeach muscle cell that allow the muscle as a whole to con-tract. There is evidence indicating that strength trainingmay be better than aerobic exercise alone for improvingself-esteem and body image. Weight training allows oneimmediate feedback, through observation of progress inmuscle growth and improved muscle tone. Strengtheningexercise can take the form of isometric, isotonic and iso-kinetic strengthening.\nISOMETRIC EXERCISE. During isometric exercises,\nmuscles contract. However, there is no motion in theaffected joints. The muscle fibers maintain a constantlength throughout the entire contraction. The exercisesare usually performed against an immovable surface orobject such as pressing one’s hand against a wall. Themuscles of the arm are contracting but the wall is notreacting or moving as a result of the physical effort. Iso-metric training is effective for developing total strengthof a particular muscle or group of muscles. It is oftenused for rehabilitation since the exact area of muscleweakness can be isolated and strengthening can beadministered at the proper joint angle. This kind of train-ing can provide a relatively quick and convenient method\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1250ExerciseTHREE TYPES OF EXERCISE\nStretching, for flexibility Weight-bearing, for \nstrengthening muscles\n and bone massAerobic, for the heart\nExercise is utilized to improve health, maintain fitness, and is important as a means of physical rehabilitation. (Illustration by\nElectronic Illustrators Group.)GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1250for overloading and strengthening muscles without any\nspecial equipment and with little chance of injury.\nISOTONIC EXERCISE. Isotonic exercise differs from\nisometric exercise in that there is movement of a jointduring the muscle contraction. A classic example of anisotonic exercise is weight training with dumbbells andbarbells. As the weight is lifted throughout the range ofmotion, the muscle shortens and lengthens. Calisthenicsare also an example of isotonic exercise. These wouldinclude chin-ups, push-ups, and sit-ups, all of which usebody weight as the resistance force.\nISOKINETIC EXERCISE. Isokinetic exercise utilizes\nmachines that control the speed of contraction within therange of motion. Isokinetic exercise attempts to combinethe best features of both isometrics and weight training.It provides muscular overload at a constant preset speedwhile a muscle mobilizes its force through the full rangeof motion. For example, an isokinetic stationary bicycleset at 90 revolutions per minute means that despite howhard and fast the exerciser works, the isokinetic proper-ties of the bicycle will allow the exerciser to pedal onlyas fast as 90 revolutions per minute. Machines known asCybex and Biodex provide isokinetic results; they aregenerally used by physical therapists and are not readilyavailable to the general population.\nCardiac rehabilitation\nExercise can be very helpful in prevention and\nrehabilitation of cardiac disorders and disease. With anindividually designed exercise program set at a levelconsidered safe for that individual, people with symp-toms of heart failure can substantially improve their\nfitness levels. The greatest benefit occurs as musclesimprove the efficiency of their oxygen use, whichreduces the need for the heart to pump as much blood.While such exercise doesn’t appear to improve the con-dition of the heart itself, the increased fitness levelreduces the total workload of the heart. The relatedincrease in endurance should also translate into a gener-ally more active lifestyle. Endurance or aerobic rou-tines, such as running, brisk walking, cycling, or swim-ming, increase the strength and efficiency of the mus-cles of the heart.\nPreparation\nA physical examination by a physician is important\nto determine if strenuous exercise is appropriate or detri-mental for an individual. Prior to the exercise program,proper stretching is important to prevent the possibilityof soft tissue injury resulting from tight muscles, ten-dons, ligaments, and other joint-related structures.KEY TERMS\nAerobic —Exercise training that is geared to pro-\nvide a sufficient cardiovascular overload to stimu-late increases in cardiac output.\nCalisthenics —Exercise involving free movement\nwithout the aid of equipment.\nEndurance —The time limit of a person’s ability to\nmaintain either a specific force or power involvingmuscular contractions.\nOsteoporosis —A disorder characterized by loss of\ncalcium in the bone, leading to thinning of thebones. It occurs frequently in postmenopausalwomen.\nAftercare\nProper cool down after exercise is important in\nreducing the occurrence of painful muscle spasms. It hasbeen documented that proper cool down may alsodecrease frequency and intensity of muscle stiffness theday following any exercise program.\nRisks\nImproper warm up can lead to muscle strains.\nOverexertion with not enough time between exercise ses-sions to recuperate can also lead to muscle strains, result-ing in inactivity due to pain. Stress fractures are also a\npossibility if activities are strenuous over long periods oftime without proper rest. Although exercise is safe for themajority of children and adults, there is still a need forfurther studies to identify potential risks.\nNormal results\nSignificant health benefits are obtained by including a\nmoderate amount of physical exercise in the form of anexercise prescription. This is much like a drug prescriptionin that it also helps enhance the health of those who take itin the proper dosage. Physical activity plays a positive rolein preventing disease and improving overall health status.People of all ages, both male and female, benefit from reg-ular physical activity. Regular exercise also provides signif-icant psychological benefits and improves quality of life.\nAbnormal results\nThere is a possibility of exercise burnout if an exer-\ncise program is not varied and adequate rest periods are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1251ExerciseGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1251not taken between exercise sessions.

    "title": "Exophthalmos",
    "content": "Exophthalmos\nDefinition\nWhen there is an increase in the volume of the tissue\nbehind the eyes, the eyes will appear to bulge out of theface. The terms exophthalmos and proptosis apply. Prop-tosis can refer to any organ that is displaced forward,while exophthalmos refers just to the eyes.\nDescription\nThe eye socket (orbit) is made of bone and therefore\nwill not yield to increased pressure within it. Only for-ward displacement of the eyeball (globe) will allow moreroom if tissue behind the eye is increasing.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common cause of exophthalmos is\nGraves’ disease, overactivity of the thyroid gland. Thecontents of the orbits swell due to inflammation, forcingthe eyes forward. The inflammation affects primarily themuscles. This combination of muscle impairment andforward displacement reduces eye movement, causingdouble vision and crossed eyes ( strabismus ). The optic\nnerves can also be affected, reducing vision, and theclear membrane (conjunctiva) covering the white part ofthe eyes and lining the inside of the eyelids can swell.Finally, the eyes may protrude so far that the eyelids can-not close over them, leading to corneal damage.\nExophthalmos from Graves’ disease is bilateral\n(occurring on both sides), but not necessarily symmetri-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1252ExophthalmosGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1252cal. In contrast, exophthalmos from orbital tumors or a\nblood clot in the brain happens on only one side.\nDiagnosis\nExophthalmos is obvious when it is advanced\nenough to cause complications. When there is doubt inthe early stages, a mechanical device called an exoph-thalmometer can measure the protrusion. Computed\ntomography scans (CT scans) are of great value in\nexamining the bony components of the orbit. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) scanning is equally valuable\nfor displaying the contents of the orbit, because it “seesthrough” the bone.\nTreatment\nIf a tumor is growing behind the eye, it needs to be\nremoved. If Graves’ disease is the cause, it may subsidewith treatment of the overactive thyroid, but this is notguaranteed. Local care to the front of the eye to keep itmoist is necessary if the eyelid cannot close.\nPrognosis\nExophthalmos can be progressive. Its progress must\nbe carefully followed, treating complications as theyoccur.\nPrevention\nVision can usually be preserved with attentive treat-\nment. There is currently no way to prevent any of theunderlying conditions that lead to exophthalmos.Resources\nBOOKS\nNewell, Frank W. “Endocrine Disease and the Eye.” In Oph-\nthalmology: Principles and Concepts. 8th ed.

When apatient cannot voluntarily control urination (inconti-nence), a physician may order this test to determine if theproblem is caused by the failure of this muscle. The vol-untary contraction or release of a muscle such as theexternal sphincter involves a complex process in whichthe nerves controlling the muscle signal it to movethrough the release and uptake of chemicals called neu-rotransmitters and the generation of electrical impulses.This test records the electrical impulses given off whenthe muscle contracts or relaxes and allows the physicianto determine if the muscle is working properly, if it hasbeen damaged by disease, or some other condition.\nPrecautions\nPatients who are taking muscle relaxants or drugs\nthat act like or have an effect on the neurotransmitteracetylcholine (cholinergic or anti-cholinergic drugs)should tell the doctor since they will change the testresults. The results will also be altered if the patient movesduring the test or if the electrodes are improperly placed.\nDescription\nThe patient puts on a surgical gown and lies down on\nthe examining table. The procedure, which takes between30–60 minutes, may be conducted one of three ways:\n• Skin electrodes. This is the most commonly used method\nof recording information. The skin where the electrodeswill be placed is cleaned and shaved and an electricallyconductive paste is applied. The electrodes are then tapedin place. For female patients, the electrodes are tapedaround the urethra, while for male patients they areplaced between the scrotum and the anus.\n• Needle electrodes. This is considered the most accurate\nmethod, since the electrodes are inserted directly intothe muscle, using needles to guide placement. For malepatients, a gloved finger is inserted in the rectum, thenneedles with wires attached are inserted through theskin between the anus and the scrotum. For femaleKEY TERMS\nAnti-cholinergic drug —A medication that blocks\nor subdues the action of the neurotransmitteracetylcholine.\nCholinergic drug —A medication that mimics or\nenhances the action of the neurotransmitteracetylcholine.\nSphincter —A circular muscle that aids in the\nopening or closing of an opening in the body.\npatients, the needles are inserted around the urethra.\nThe discomfort of placing the needles is about the sameas that of an injection. The needles are withdrawn, andthe wires are taped to the thigh.\n• Anal plug electrodes. The tip of an anal plug is lubricat-\ned and inserted into the rectum as the patient relaxes theanal sphincter. Electrodes are attached to the anal plug.\nOnce the electrodes are in place and attached to the\nrecording device, the patient is asked to alternately con-tract and relax the external sphincter muscle. The electri-cal activity generated during these contractions and relax-ations is recorded on a graph called an electromyogram.\nPreparation\nBefore the test, the patient should discuss with the\ndoctor whether it is necessary to temporarily discontinueany medications, and follow the doctor’s orders.

ECMO is used most often in new-borns and young children, but it also can be used as a lastresort for adults whose heart or lungs are failing.\nPurpose\nIn newborns, ECMO is used to support or replace an\ninfant’s undeveloped or failing lungs by providing oxy-gen and removing carbon dioxide waste products so thelungs can rest. Infants who need ECMO may includethose with:\n• meconium aspiration syndrome (breathing in of a new-\nborn’s first stool by a fetus or newborn, which canblock air passages and interfere with lung expansion)\n• persistent pulmonary hypertension (a disorder in\nwhich the blood pressure in the arteries supplying thelungs is abnormally high)\n• respiratory distress syndrome (a lung disorder usually\nof premature infants that causes increasing difficulty inbreathing, leading to a life-threatening deficiency ofoxygen in the blood)• congenital diaphragmatic hernia (the profusion of part\nof the stomach through an opening in the diaphragm).\n• pneumonia• blood poisoning\nECMO is also used to support a child or adult\npatient’s damaged, infected, or failing lungs for a fewhours to allow treatment or healing. It is effective forthose patients with severe, but reversible, heart or lungproblems who haven’t responded to treatment with aventilator, drugs, or extra oxygen. Adults and childrenwho need ECMO usually have one of these problems:\n• heart failure• pneumonia•respiratory failure caused by trauma or severe infec-\ntion\nThe ECMO procedure can help a patient’s lungs and\nheart rest and recover, but it will not cure the underlyingdisease. Any patient who requires ECMO is seriously illand will likely die without the treatment. Because thereis some risk involved, this method is used only whenother means of support have failed.\nPrecautions\nTypically, ECMO patients have daily chest x rays\nand blood work, and constant vital sign monitoring. Theyare usually placed on a special rotating bed that isdesigned to decrease pressure on the skin and help movesecretions from the lungs.\nAfter the patient is stable on ECMO, the breathing\nmachine settings will be lowered to “rest” settings, whichallows the lungs to rest without the risk of too much oxy-gen or pressure from the ventilator.\nDescription\nThere are two types of ECMO: Venoarterial (V-A)\nECMO supports the heart and lungs, and is used forpatients with blood pressure or heart functioning prob-lems in addition to respiratory problems. Venovenous (V-V) ECMO supports the lungs only.\nV-A ECMO requires the insertion of two tubes, one\nin the jugular and one in the carotid artery. In the V-VECMO procedure, the surgeon places a plastic tube intothe jugular vein through a small incision in the neck.\nOnce in place, the tubes are connected to the ECMO\ncircuit, and then the machine is turned on. The patient’sblood flows out through the tube and may look very darkbecause it contains very little oxygen. A pump pushes theblood through an artificial membrane lung, where oxygenis added and carbon dioxide is removed. The size of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1256Extracorporeal membrane oxygenationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1256artificial lung depends on the size of the patient; sometimes\nadults need two lungs. The blood is then warmed andreturned to the patient. A steady amount of blood (calledthe flow rate) is pushed through the ECMO machine everyminute. As the patient improves, the flow rate is lowered.\nMany patients require heavy sedation while they are\non ECMO to lessen the amount of oxygen needed by themuscles.\nAs the patient improves, the amount of ECMO sup-\nport will be decreased gradually, until the machine isturned off for a brief trial period. If the patient does wellwithout ECMO, the treatment is stopped.\nTypically, newborns remain on ECMO for three to\nseven days, although some babies need more time (espe-cially if they have a diaphragmatic hernia). Once thebaby is off ECMO, he or she will still need a ventilator(breathing machine) for a few days or weeks. Adults mayremain on ECMO for days to weeks, depending on thecondition of the patient, but treatment may be continuedfor a longer time depending on the type of heart or lungdisease, the amount of damage to the lungs beforeECMO was begun, and the presence of any other illness-es or health problems.\nPreparation\nBefore ECMO is begun, the patient receives medica-\ntion to ease pain and restrict movement.\nAftercare\nBecause infants on ECMO may have been strug-\ngling with low oxygen levels before treatment, they maybe at higher risk for developmental problems. They willneed to be monitored as they grow.\nRisks\nBleeding is the biggest risk for ECMO patients,\nsince blood thinners are given to guard against bloodclots. Bleeding can occur anywhere in the body, but ismost serious when it occurs in the brain. This is whydoctors periodically perform ultrasound brain scans ofanyone on ECMO. Stroke , which may be caused by\nbleeding or blood clots in the brain, has occurred in somepatients undergoing ECMO.\nIf bleeding becomes a problem, the patient may\nrequire frequent blood transfusions or operations to con-trol the bleeding. If the bleeding can’t be stopped,ECMO will be withdrawn.\nOther risks include infection or vocal cord injury.\nSome patients develop severe blood infections that causeirreversible damage to vital organs.KEY TERMS\nCarotid artery —Two main arteries (passageway\ncarrying blood from the heart to other parts of thebody) that carry blood to the brain.\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia —The profusion\nof part of the stomach through an opening in thediaphragm.\nMeconium aspiration syndrome —Breathing in of\nmeconium (a newborn’s first stool) by a fetus ornewborn, which can block air passages and inter-fere with lung expansion.\nMembrane oxygenator —The artificial lung that\nadds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide.\nPulmonary hypertension —A disorder in which the\nblood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungsis abnormally high.\nRespiratory distress syndrome —A lung disorder\nusually of premature infants that causes increasingdifficulty in breathing, leading to a life-threateningdeficiency of oxygen in the blood.\nVenoarterial (V-A) bypass —The type of ECMO\nthat provides both heart and lung support, usingtwo tubes (one in the jugular vein and one in thecarotid artery).\nVenovenous (V-V) bypass —The type of ECMO that\nprovides lung support only, using a tube insertedinto the jugular vein.\nThere is a small chance that some part of the com-\nplex equipment may fail, which could introduce air intothe system or affect the patient’s blood levels, causingdamage or death of vital organs (including the brain).\nFor this reason, the ECMO circuit is constantly moni-tored by a trained technologist.\nNormal results\nLungs and/or heart return to healthy functioning.\nAbnormal results\nLungs and/or heart do not improve while on ECMO.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics. “Recommendations on\nExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.” Pediatrics 85\n(Apr. 1990): 618-619.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1257Extracorporeal membrane oxygenationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1257Anderson III, Harry, and Cynthia Steimie, et al. “Extracorpore-\nal Life Support for Adult Cardiorespiratory Failure.”Surgery 114 (1993): 161.\nShanley, Charles J., Ronald B.

    "title": "Eye and orbit ultrasounds",
    "content": "Eye and orbit ultrasounds\nDefinition\nUltrasound imaging equipment allows eye special-\nists (ophthalmologists) to “see” the eye in great detailwithout the pain and risk of exploratory surgery, or the\nlimitations and uncertainty inherent to traditional visu-al examination. Ultrasound is used to detect and diag-nose many eye diseases and injuries, to measure theeye prior to corrective surgery, and directly as a treat-ment tool.\nPurpose\nAn ophthalmologist uses ultrasonic imaging to help\ndiagnose the underlying cause(s) of a patient’s symp-toms, to assess the general condition of an injured eye,and to measure the eye prior to corrective surgery. Situa-tions that may call for ultrasonic imaging include:\n• Excessive tearing or visible infection. These external\nsymptoms could indicate a serious underlying problemsuch as a tumor, an internal infection, the presence of adeeply lodged irritant (foreign body), or the effects of apreviously unrecognized injury. When presented withgeneral symptoms, ultrasound can speed diagnosis if aserious condition is suspected.\n• Impaired vision. Fuzzy vision, poor night vision,\nrestricted (tunnel) vision, blind spots, extreme lightsensitivity, and even blindness can all stem from innereye conditions ranging from glaucoma and cataracts ,\nto retinitis, detached retina, tumors, or impaired bloodcirculation. Again, high resolution ultrasound canquickly identify causes and pinpoint their location. Aspecial type of ultrasound, known as Doppler, can evenperceive and measure circulation in the tiny blood ves-sels of the eye.\n• Eye trauma. The eye can be damaged by a direct impact\nor a puncture wound, as a result of a general head trau-ma, or by intense light exposure. Even when the causeof injury is obvious, ultrasound can reveal the exacttype, extent, and location of damage, from deforma-tions and ruptures to internal bleeding, and help toguide emergency care efforts.\n• Lens replacement surgery. Exact measurement of the\neye’s optical dimensions with ultrasound greatlyimproves the visual outcome for cataract patientsreceiving permanent synthetic lenses; and for severelymyopic patients receiving implanted corrective lenses.\nOphthalmic ultrasound imaging is also used routine-\nly to guide the precise placement of instruments duringsurgery, and can be used directly for the treatment ofglaucoma and tumors of the eye.\nPrecautions\nUltrasound of the eye, properly performed by quali-\nfied personnel using appropriate equipment, has no risks.There is no evidence to suggest that the procedure itselfposes any threat to a healthy eye, or worsens the condi-tion of a diseased or injured eye.\nDescription\nOphthalmic ultrasound equipment sends high fre-\nquency pulses of sound into the eye, where they bounceoff the boundaries between different structures in the eyeand produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. This echopattern is received and interpreted by a computer to pro-duce an image on a television screen. The time it takes anecho to return to the receiver corresponds to the depth ittraveled into the eye.\nSingle transducer (the sound transmitter/receiver)\nultrasound is used to measure distances within the eye.This is A-mode ultrasound. A linear array of transduc-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1258Eye and orbit ultrasoundsGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1258ers in a single small probe, B-mode, provides a picture\nof a cross section through the eye. Doppler modeultrasound combines B-mode with the ability to detectand measure the flow of blood in the tiny vessels ofthe eye.\nAs a direct treatment tool, the vibrations of high\nintensity A-mode ultrasound can be used to heat anderode tumors. The same technique can be used to con-trol glaucoma by selectively destroying the cells whichproduce the fluid that causes the internal pressure of theeye to rise.\nThe procedure followed in a regular ultrasonic eye\nexamination is relatively simple. The patient relaxes in\na comfortable chair in a darkened room. Mild anestheticeye drops are administered and the head is held secure.The ultrasonic probe, coated with a sterile gel to ensuregood contact, is lightly pressed against the eye as theimages are made. The probe may be applied to the eye-lid or directly to the eye, as necessary. The patient feelsnothing else, and the whole office procedure takes about15 minutes.\nPreparation\nPreparation by the patient is generally unnecessary,\nalthough under special circumstances an ophthalmologistmay perform pretest procedures. The ophthalmologistand/or ultrasound technician will conduct all prepara-tions at the time of the test.\nAftercare\nPatients may experience partial and temporary\nblurred vision, as well as “eye strain” headaches. Thesesymptoms usually fade within an hour of the procedure,during which time patients should rest their eyes andavoid all activities that require good eyesight, like driving.\nRisks\nImproperly focused, high-intensity ultrasound could\nburn and physically disrupt delicate eye tissue and causeinjury. This risk is, however, slight and would arise onlyfrom improper use, or as a potential side effect of tumoror glaucoma treatment.\nNormal results\nA normal ultrasound scan would indicate a fully\nhealthy eye. For therapeutic ultrasound, a normal resultwould be an improvement in the targeted condition, suchas shrinking of a tumor or lessening of pressure insidethe eye of a glaucoma patient.KEY TERMS\nCataracts —A clouding of the lens of the eye or the\nmaterial immediately surrounding it, causingblurred vision. For many people it occurs naturallywith aging, but may also result from injury.\nGlaucoma —A common eye disease characterized\nby increased fluid pressure in the eye that dam-ages the optic nerve, which carries sensations tothe brain. Glaucoma can be caused by anothereye disorder, such as a tumor or congenital mal-formation, or appear without obvious cause, but ifuntreated it generally leads to blindness.\nIntraocular —Literally, within the eye.\nOphthalmologist —A medical doctor specializing\nin eye care who is generally, but not necessarily,an eye surgeon.\nRetina —The third and innermost membrane of the\neye, which contains the light-sensitive nerve tissuethat leads into the optic nerve and is the primaryinstument of vision. Inflammation of the retina(retinitis) has many causes, including over-expo-sure to intense light, diabetes, and syphilis.\nAbnormal results\nBecause diagnostic ultrasound is generally used to\ninvestigate symptoms, the results of a scan will often beabnormal and they will detect evidence of an underlyingcondition.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGuthoff, Rudolf.

    "title": "Eye cancer",
    "content": "Eye cancer\nDefinition\nA cancerous growth in any part of the eye.\nDescription\nEye cancer can occur in many parts of the eye\nwhere a tumor can occur. Because of this there are sever-al types of ocular cancer. Their occurrence varies in theage of the affected individual. This article will focus onretinoblastoma , the most common eye cancer in chil-\ndren, and intraocular melanoma, the most common eyecancer in adults.\nRetinoblastoma can occur at any age but is most\noften seen in children younger than five. About 200 chil-dren a year are diagnosed with it in the United States.Retinoblastoma starts with a small tumor in the retina,the very back of the eye. In growing children, the retinaoriginates from cells called retinoblasts that grow anddivide very quickly. These cells eventually become themature cells of the retina when they stop growing. In thecase of retinoblastoma the retinoblasts don’t stop grow-ing and form a tumor that can continue to grow and causefurther complications if not treated quickly.\nRetinoblastoma typically has three classifications:\nintraocular, extraocular and recurrent retinoblastoma. Inthe intraocular form the cancer can be found in one orboth eyes but not in tissue external of the eye. In theextraocular form the cancer has spread outside the eye. Itcan spread to the tissue surrounding the eye or it caninvade other areas of the body. In the recurrent form thecancer returns after already being treated. It may recur inthe eye, its surrounding tissues, or elsewhere in the body.\nIntraocular melanoma is a rare cancer overall, yet it\nis the most common eye cancer seen in adults. It is whencancer cells are found in the uvea of the eye. The uveaincludes the iris (the colored portion of eye), the ciliarybody (an eye muscle that focuses the lens) and thechoroid (found in the back of the eye next to the retina).Intraocular cancer of the iris usually grows slowly\nand usually doesn’t spread. The tumor is seen on the irisas a darker spot than the surrounding area. Intraocularcancer of the choroid or ciliary body occurs in the backof the eye. They are classified by size with a small tumorbeing 2-3 mm or smaller and a medium or large tumorbeing bigger than 3 mm.\nIntraocular cancer can spread and become extraocu-\nlar as well. If not found and treated early enough it canspread to the surrounding tissues, the optic nerve or intothe eye socket.\nCauses and symptoms\nGenetics is thought to play a role in eye cancer. In\nregards to retinoblastoma, it is believed that if a tumordevelops only in one eye then it isn’t hereditary. Howev-er, if a tumor occurs in both eyes then it is hereditary.Those who have hereditary retinoblastoma have a rarerisk of developing a tumor in the brain and should bemonitored on a regular basis.\nThe cause of intraocular melanoma is still vague.\nGenetics could play a role, but age is also a factor. Inter-estingly enough, this type of cancer is seen most often inwhite people from a northern European descent.\nThe symptoms of this type of cancer usually begin\nwith blurred vision and tenderness of the eye. Advancedsymptoms may include loss of vision. If these symptomspersist a person should make an appointment with theirophthalmologist.\nDiagnosis\nAn ophthalmologist makes a diagnosis. The doctor\nis usually able to see the tumor through the pupil ordirectly on the iris if the cancer is intraocular melanomaof the iris. Because the doctor can usually readily see thetumor a biopsy is rarely needed.\nAn ultrasound or a fluorescein angiography are two\ntests doctors use to further diagnose eye cancers. In anultrasound sound waves are pointed at the tumor anddepending on how they reflect off the tumor the doctorcan better diagnose it. In a fluorescein angiography a flu-orescent dye is injected into the patients arm. When thisdye circulates through the body and reaches the eye aseries of rapid pictures are taken through the pupil. Thetumor will show up in these photos.\nOnce a diagnosis has been made, the treatment can\nbegin.\nTreatment\nThe treatment depends on how far advanced the\ntumor is. If the tumor is in the advanced stages and thereis little hope of regaining vision the most effective treat-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1260Eye cancerGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1260ment is an enucleation, the removal of the eye. This obvi-\nously is a drastic treatment and is avoided if possible.Other eye surgeries include the following:\n• choroidectomy-removal of part of the choroid,• iridectomy-removal of part of the iris,• iridocyclectomy-removal of parts of the ciliary body\nand parts of iris,\n• iridotrabeculectomy-removal of parts of the supporting\ntissues around the cornea and iris.\nIn eye cancer where the tumor is small and there is a\ngood chance that the vision will be restored less drasticmeasures than the above surgeries are taken. Radiationand chemotherapy are two courses of treatment that\nhelp in killing off the existing tumor and preventing itsspread into other areas of the body.\nBesides radiation and chemotherapy there are other\nmethods of treating eye cancer. Cryotherapy uses\nextreme cold to destroy the cancer cells. Thermotherapyuses heat to destroy the cancer cells. Photocoagulationuses a laser to destroy blood vessels that supply the tumorwith nutrients. If the tumor isn’t advanced these are goodoptions to treat it in order to avoid losing an eye.\nA radiation/surgical treatment for eye cancer is\nbrachytherapy. A small plaque with radioactive iodine onone side and gold on the other is stitched to the eyebehind the tumor with the radioactive iodine facing thetumor. The gold is used to shield the other tissues fromthe radiation. It is left there for a period of time depend-ing on the dosage of radiation needed and then it isremoved. In this way the tumor is treated and hopefullywill shrink and eventually die.\nAlternative Treatment\nOther than the treatments above, there aren’t any\nalternative treatments. New clinical trials are constantlyunder way to further the treatment of the disease in thefuture.\nPrognosis\nAll forms of retinoblastoma and intraocular mela-\nnoma are treatable. Enucleation can usually be avoided iffound early enough. The outlook is positive for peoplewith eye cancer.\nPrevention\nA good healthy diet and lifestyle are always recom-\nmended to prevent cancer. Known carcinogens shouldalways be avoided.KEY TERMS\nCarcinogen —A substance that is known to cause\ncancer.\nCornea —The clear layer that covers the front part\nof the eye.\nEnucleation —Surgical removal of the eye.\nPupil —The hole in the eye that allows light in.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nWilson, Czechonska, Finger, Rausen, Hooper, and Haik.\n“Chemotherapy for Eye Cancer.” Survey of Ophthalmolo-\ngy(March/April 2001): 416-44.\nOTHER\nThe American Cancer Society. 2000. <http://www.cancer.\norg>.\nCancer Net. 2001. <http://www.cancernet.nci.nih.gov>.JHMI. 2001. <http://www.med.jhu.edu>.National Eye Institute. 1998. <http://www.nei.nih.gov>.\nThomas Scott Eagan\nRonald Watson, PhD"

    "title": "Eye examination",
    "content": "Eye examination\nDefinition\nAn eye examination is a series of tests that measure\na person’s ocular health and visual status, to detectabnormalities in the components of the visual system,and to determine how well the person can see.\nPurpose\nAn eye examination is performed by an ophthalmol-\nogist M.D. or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy ), or an optom-\netrist (O.D.) to determine if there are any pre-existing orpotential vision problems. Eye exams may also reveal thepresence of many non-eye diseases. Many systemic dis-eases can affect the eyes, and since the blood vessels onthe retina are observed during the exam, certain problemsmay be uncovered (e.g., high blood pressure or diabetes).\nInfants should be examined by a physician to detect\nany physical abnormalities. Frequency of eye exams thengenerally differs with age and the health of the person. Eyeexams can be performed in infants, and if a problem is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1261Eye examinationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1261noted the infant can be seen, generally by a pediatric oph-\nthalmologist. A child with no symptoms should have aneye exam at age three. Early exams are important becausepermanent decreases in vision (e.g., amblyopia , also\ncalled lazy eye) can occur if not treated early (usually byages 6–9). Again, with no other symptoms, the se cond\nexam should take place before first grade. After firstgrade, the American Optometric Association recom-mends an eye exam every two years; ages 19–40, everytwo to three years; ages 41–60, every two years; andannually after that. However, these are recommendationsfor healthy people with no risk factors. Patients shouldask their doctors how often they should come for exams.Some patients have risk factors for eye disease (e.g., peo-ple with diabetes or a family history of eye disease;African Americans, who are at higher risk for glaucoma )\nand may need more frequent checkups. Also, if childrenseem to be having trouble in school, problems with read-ing, rubbing their eyes when reading, etc., an eye exammay be necessary sooner.\nPrecautions\nThe examiner needs to know if the patient is taking\nany medications or has any existing health conditions.Some medications, even over-the-counter (OTC) medica-tions can affect vision or even interfere with the eyedropsthe doctor may use during the exam. Certain eyedropswould not be used if the patient has asthma , heart prob-\nlems, or other conditions.\nThe patient may need someone to drive them home\nin case the eyes were dilated. Bringing sunglasses to theexam may also help decrease the glare from light untilthe dilating drops wear off.\nDescription\nAn eye examination, given by an ophthalmologist or\noptometrist, costs about $100. It may or may not be cov-ered by insurance. It begins with information from thepatient (case history) and continues with a set of primarytests, plus additional specialized tests given as needed, dic-tated by the outcomes of initial testing and the patient’sage. The primary tests can be divided into two groups,those that evaluate the physical state of the eyes and sur-rounding areas, and those that measure the ability to see.\nThe order of the tests for the exam may differ from\ndoctor to doctor, however, most exams will include thefollowing procedures:\nInformation gathering and initial observations\nThe examiner will take eye and medical histories that\ninclude the patient’s chief complaint, any past eye disor-ders, all medications being taken (e.g., OTC medications,\nantibiotics , and birth control pills), any blood relatives\nwith eye disorders, and any systemic disorders the patientmay have. The patient should also tell the doctor abouthobbies and work conditions. This information helps inmodifying prescriptions and lets the doctor know how thepatient uses his or her eyes. For example, using a comput-er screen vs. construction work, the working distance of acomputer screen may affect the prescription; the con-struction worker needs protective eyewear.\nThe patient should bring their current pair of glasses\nto the exam. The doctor can get the prescription from theglasses by using an instrument called a lensometer.\nVisual acuity examination\nVisual acuity measures how clearly the patient can\nsee. It is measured for each eye separately, with andwithout the current prescription. It is usually measuredwith a Snellen eye chart, a poster with lines of different-sized letters, each line with a number at the side denotingthe distance from which a person with normal vision canread that line. Other kinds of eye charts with identifiablefigures are available for children or anyone unfamiliarwith the Roman alphabet. These charts are made to beplaced at a certain distance (usually 20 ft) from the per-son being tested. At this distance, people with normalvision can read a certain line (usually the lowest),marked the 20/20 line; these people are said to have20/20 vision. For people who can’t read the smallest line,the examiner assigns a ratio based on the smallest linethey can read. The first number (numerator) of the ratiois the distance between the chart and the patient, and thesecond number (denominator) is the distance where aperson with normal vision would be able to read thatline. The ratio 20/40 means the patient can see at 20 ft.what people with normal vision can see at 40 ft. away.\nWhen a patient is unable to read any lines on the\nchart, they are moved closer until they can read the linewith the largest letters. The acuity is still measured thesame way. A ratio of 5/200 means the person being testedcan see at 5 ft what a normal person can see 200 ft.\nWhen a patient can’t read the chart at all, the exam-\niner may hold up some fingers and ask the patient tocount them at various distances, and records the result as“counting fingers” at the distance of recognition. If thepatient cannot count the examiner’s fingers at any dis-tance, the examiner determines if the patient can seehand movements. If so, the result is recorded as “handmovements.” If not, the examiner determines if thepatient can detect light from a penlight. If the patient candetect the light but not its direction, the result is recordedat “light perception.” If the patient can recognize its\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1262Eye examinationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1262direction, the result is recorded as “light projection.” If\nthe patient cannot detect the light at all, the result isrecorded as “no light perception.”\nEye movement examination and cover tests\nThe examiner asks the patient to look up and down,\nand to the right and left to see if the patient can move theeyes to their full extent. The examiner asks the patient tostare at an object, then quickly covers one eye and notesany movement in the eye that remains uncovered. Thisprocedure is repeated with the other eye. This, and anoth-er similar cover test, helps to determine if there is anundetected eye turn or problem with fixation. The doctormay also have the patient look at a pen and follow it as itis moved close to the eyes. This checks convergence.\nIris and pupil examination\nThe doctor checks the pupil’s response to light (if it\ndilates and constricts appropriately). The iris is viewedfor symmetry and physical appearance. The iris ischecked more thoroughly later using a slit lamp.\nRefractive error determination-Refraction\nThe examiner will determine the refractive error and\nobtain a prescription for corrective lenses for peoplewhose visual acuity is less than 20/20. An instrumentcalled a phoropter, which the patient sits behind, is gen-erally used (sometimes the refraction can be done with atrial frame that the patient wears). The phoropter isequipped with many lenses that allow the examiner totest many combinations of corrections to learn whichcorrection allows the patient to see the eye chart mostclearly. This is the part of the exam when the doctor usu-ally says, “Which is better, one or two?” The phoropteralso contains prisms, and sometimes the doctor willintentionally make the patient see double. This may helpin determining a slight eye turn. The exam will checkvision at distance and near (reading).\nA prescription for corrective lenses can also be sup-\nplied by automated refracting devices, which measurethe necessary refraction by shining a light into the eyeand observing the reflected light. Another objective wayto obtain a prescription is using a hand-held retinoscope.As in the automated method just mentioned, the doctorshines a light in the patient’s eyes and can determine anobjective prescription. This is helpful in young childrenor infants.\nSometimes drops will be instilled in the patient’s eyes\nbefore this part of the exam. The drops may relax accom-modation so that the refraction will be more accurate. Thisis helpful in children and people who are farsighted.After the refraction and other visual status tests, for\nexample color tests or binocularity tests (can the patient see3-D, or have depth perception), the doctor will check thehealth of the eyes and surrounding areas. The main instru-ments used are the ophthalmoscope and the slit lamp.\nOphthalmoscopic examination\nThese observations are best accomplished after\ndilating the pupils and require an ophthalmoscope. Theophthalmoscope most frequently used is a called a direct\nophthalmoscope . It is a hand-held illuminated 15X\nmulti-lens magnifier that lets the examiner view theinside back area of the eye (fundus). The retina, bloodvessels, optic nerve, and other structures are examined.\nSlit lamp examination\nThe slit lamp is a microscope with a light source that\ncan be adjusted. This magnifies the external and someinternal structures of the eyes. The lid and lid margin,cornea, iris, pupil, conjunctiva, sclera, and lens are exam-ined. The slit lamp is also used in contact lens evalua-tions. A little probe called a tonometer may be used atthis time to check the pressure of the eyes. A colored eye-drop may be instilled immediately prior to this test. Thedrop has a local anesthetic so the patient won’t feel theprobe touch the eye. It is a quick procedure.\nVisual field measurement\nA perimeter, the instrument for measuring visual\nfields, is a hollow hemisphere, equipped with a lightsource that projects dots of light over the inside surface.The patient’s head is positioned so that the eye beingtested is at the center of the sphere and 13 in (about 33\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1263Eye examination\nA woman looking through a refractor.

The patient stares straight ahead at an image onthe center of the surface and signals whenever he or shedetects a flash of light. The perimeter records whichflashes are seen and which are missed and maps thepatient’s field of vision and blindspots.\nIntraocular pressure (IOP) measurement\nTonometers are used to measure IOP. Some tonome-\nters measure pressure by expelling a puff of air (noncon-tact tonometer) towards the eyeball from a very short dis-tance. Other tonometers are placed directly on the cornea.The noncontact tonometers are not as accurate as the con-tact tonometers and are sometimes used for screenings.\nCompleting the evaluation with additional tests\nDepending upon the results other tests may be\nnecessary. These can include, but are not limited toKEY TERMS\nAmblyopia —Decreased visual acuity, usually in\none eye, in the absence of any structural abnormali-ty in the eye.\nConjunctiva —The mucous membrane that covers the\nwhite part of the eyes (sclera) and lines the eyelids.\nCornea —Clear outer covering of the front of the eye.\nFloaters —Translucent specks that float across the\nvisual field, due to small objects floating in the vit-reous humor.\nFundus —The inside of an organ. In the eye, refers to\nthe back area that can be seen with the ophthalmo-scope.\nGlaucoma —There are many types of glaucoma.\nGlaucoma results in optic nerve damage and adecreased visual field and blindness if not treated. Itis usually associated with increased IOP, but that isnot always the case. The three factors associatedwith glaucoma are increased IOP, a change in theoptic nerve head, and changes in the visual field.\nGonioscope —An instrument used to inspect the\neye (e.g., the anterior chamber). It consists of amagnifier and a lens equipped with mirrors; it’splaced on the patient’s cornea.\nIris—The colored ring just behind the cornea and in\nfront of the lens that controls the amount of lightsent to the retina.Macula —The central part of the retina where the\nrods and cones are densest.\nOphthalmoscope —An instrument designed to view\nstructures in the back of the eye.\nOptic nerve —The nerve that carries visual mes-\nsages from the retina to the brain.\nPupil —The circular opening that looks like a black\nhole in the middle of the iris.\nRetina —The inner, light-sensitive layer of the eye\ncontaining rods and cones; transforms the image itreceives into electrical messages which are thensent to the brain via the optic nerve.\nSclera —The tough, fibrous, white outer protective\ncovering that surrounds the eye.\nSlit lamp —A microscope that projects a linear slit\nbeam of light onto the eye; allows viewing of theconjunctiva, cornea, iris, aqueous humor, lens, andeyelid.\nTonometer —An instrument that measures intraocu-\nlar pressure (IOP).\nUltrasonography —A method of obtaining structural\ninformation about internal tissues and organs wherean image is produced because different tissuesbounce back ultrasonic waves differently.\nbinocular indirect ophthalmoscopy, gonioscopy,\ncolor tests, contrast sensitivity testing, ultasonogra-phy, and others.

The anterior chamber lies behind the corneaand in front of the iris. If it appears cloudy or if cells canbe seen in it during the slit lamp exam an inflammationmay be present. A narrow anterior chamber may put thepatient at risk for glaucoma. A clouding of the normallyclear lens is called a cataract.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1264Eye examinationGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1264Internal observations\nOPHTHALMOSCOPIC EXAM. The observations\ninclude, but are not limited to the retina, blood vessels,and optic nerve. The optic nerve enters the back of theeye and can be checked for swelling or other problems.The blood vessels can be viewed as can the retina. Themacula is a 3–5 mm area in the back of the eye and isresponsible for central vision. The fovea is a small arealocated within the macula and is responsible for sharpvision. When a person looks at something, they arepointing the fovea at the object. Changes in the maculararea can be observed with the ophthalmoscope. Retinaltears or detachments can also be seen.\nVisual ability\nVISUAL ACUITY. The refraction will determine the\nrefractive status for each eye for distance and for near. Aprescription for glasses is made after taking many thingsinto consideration. The eye doctor may alter a prescrip-tion based upon many factors. Different materials forglasses may be suggested. For example, polycarbonatemay be suggested for children or people active in sportsbecause it is very impact resistant. Bifocals, trifocals,single-vision spectacles, and contact lenses are alsooptions.\nVISUAL FIELDS. A normal visual field extends about\n60° upward, about 75° downward, about 65° toward thenose, and about 100° toward the ear and has one blindspot close to the center. Defects in the visual field signifydamage to the retina, optic nerve, or the neurologicalvisual pathway.\nSeeing clearly does not necessarily mean the eyes\nare healthy or that the eyes are working together as ateam. Regular checkups can detect abnormalities, hope-fully before a problem arises. The eye doctor can suggestways to help protect the eyes and vision (e.g., safety gog-gles, ultraviolet (UV) coatings on lenses). A personshould also have an eye exam if they notice a change invision, eyestrain, blur, flashes of light, a sudden onset offloaters (little dots), distortion of objects, double vision,redness, pain or discharge.\nResources\nBOOKS\nChang, David F. “Ophthalmologic Examination.” In General\nOphthalmology. 14th ed.

    "title": "Eye glasses and contact lenses",
    "content": "Eye glasses and contact lenses\nDefinition\nEyeglasses and contact lenses are devices that cor-\nrect refractive errors in vision. Eyeglass lenses aremounted in frames worn on the face, sitting mostly onthe ears and nose, so that the lenses are positioned infront of the eyes. Contact lenses appear to be worn indirect contact with the cornea, but they actually float on alayer of tears that separates them from the cornea.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of eyeglasses and contact lenses is to\ncorrect or improve the vision of people with nearsighted-ness ( myopia ), farsightedness ( hyperopia ),presbyopia ,\nand astigmatism .\nPrecautions\nPeople allergic to certain plastics should not wear\ncontact lenses or eyeglass frames or lenses manufacturedfrom that type of plastic. People allergic to nickel shouldnot wear Flexon frames. People at risk of being in acci-dents that might shatter glass lenses should wear plasticlenses, preferably polycarbonate. (Lenses made frompolycarbonate, the same type of plastic used for thespace shuttle windshield, are about 50 times strongerthan other lens materials.) Also, people at risk of receiv-ing electric shock should avoid metal frames.\nPeople employed in certain occupations may be pro-\nhibited from wearing contact lenses, or may be requiredto wear safety eyewear over the contact lenses. Someoccupations, such as construction or auto repair, mayrequire safety lenses and safety frames. Physicians andemployers should be consulted for recommendations.\nDescription\nEyes are examined by optometrists (O.D.) or by\nophthalmologists (M.D. or D.O.—doctor of osteopathy ).\nPrescriptions, if necessary, are then given to patients for\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1265Eye glasses and contact lensesGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1265glasses. The glasses are generally made by an optician. A\nseparate contact lens-fitting exam is necessary if thepatient wants contact lenses, because an eyeglass pre-scription is not the same as a contact lens prescription.\nEyeglasses\nOver 140 million people in the United States wear\neyeglasses. People whose eyes have refractive errors do notsee clearly without glasses, because the light emitted fromthe objects they are observing does not come into focus ontheir retinas. For people who are farsighted, images comeinto focus behind the retina; for people who are nearsight-ed, images come into focus in front of the retina.\nLENSES. Lenses work by changing the direction of\nlight so that images come into focus on the retina. Thegreater the index of refraction of the lens material and thegreater the difference in the curvature between the twosurfaces of the lens, the greater the change in direction oflight that passes through it, and the greater the correction.\nLenses can be unifocal, with one correction for all\ndistances, or they can be correct for more than one dis-tance (multifocal). One type of multifocal, the bifocal,has an area of the lens (usually at the bottom) that cor-rects for nearby objects (about 14 in from the eyes); theremainder of the lens corrects for distant objects (about20 ft from the eyes). Another type of multifocal, a trifo-cal, has an area in-between that corrects for intermedi-ate distances (usually about 28 in). Conventional bifo-cals and trifocals have visible lines between the areas ofdifferent correction; however, lenses where the correc-tion gradually changes from one area to the other, with-out visible lines, have been available since the 1970s.Such lenses are sometimes called progressives or no-line bifocals.\nTo be suitable for eyeglass lenses, a material must be\ntransparent, without bubbles, and have a high index ofrefraction. The greater the index of refraction, the thinnerthe lens can be. Lenses are made from either glass orplastic (hard resin). The advantage of plastic is that it islightweight and more impact resistant than glass. Theadvantage of glass is that it is scratch resistant and pro-vides the clearest possible vision.\nGlass was the first material to be used for eyeglass\nlenses, and was used for several hundred years beforeplastic was introduced. The crown glass used for eye-glass lenses has an index of refraction of 1.52.\nOptical-quality acrylic was introduced for eyeglass\nuse in the early 1940s, but because it was easilyscratched, brittle, and discolored rapidly, it did not sup-plant glass as the material of choice. Furthermore, it hada relatively low index of refraction, so it wasn’t suitablefor people with large refractive errors. A plastic called\nCR-39, introduced in the 1960s, was more suitable.Today, eyeglass wearers can also choose between poly-carbonate, which is the most impact-resistant materialavailable for eyewear, and polyurethane, which hasexceptional optical qualities and an index of refraction ofup to 1.66, much higher than the conventional plasticsused for lenses, and even higher than glass. Patients withhigh prescriptions should ask about high index materialoptions for their lenses. Aspheric lenses are also usefulfor high prescriptions. They are flatter and lighter thanconventional lenses.\nThere are many lenses and lens-coating options for\nindividual needs, including coatings that block the ultra-violet (UV) light or UV and blue light which have beenfound to be harmful to the eyes. Such coatings are notneeded on polycarbonate lenses, which already have UVprotection. UV coatings are particularly important onsunglasses and ski goggles. Sunglasses, when nonpre-scription, should be labeled with an indication that theyblock out 99–100% of both UV-A and UV-B rays.\nThere are anti-scratch coatings that increase the\nsurface hardness of lenses (an important feature whenusing plastic lenses) and anti-reflective (AR) coatingsthat eliminate almost all glare and allow other people tosee the eyes of the wearer. AR coatings may be particu-larly helpful to people who use computers or who driveat night. Mirror coatings that prevent other people fromseeing the wearer’s eyes are also available. There is awhole spectrum of tints, from light tints to darker tints,used in sunglasses. Tint, however, does not block-outUV rays, so a UV coating is needed. Polaroid lensesthat block out much of the reflected light also allow bet-ter vision in sunny weather and are helpful for peoplewho enjoy boating. Photosensitive (photochromatic)lenses that darken in the presence of bright light arehandy for people who don’t want to carry an extra set ofglasses. Photochromatic lenses are available in glassand plastic.\nFRAMES. Frames can be made from metal or plastic,\nand they can be rimless. There is an almost unlimitedvariety of shapes, colors, and sizes. The type and degreeof refractive correction in the lens determine to someextent the type of frame most suitable. Some lenses aretoo thick to fit in metal rims, and some large-correctionprescriptions are best suited to frames with small-arealenses.\nRimless frames are the least noticeable type, and they\nare lightweight because the nosepiece and temples areattached directly to the lenses, eliminating the weight ofthe rims. They tend to not be as sturdy as frames with rims,so they are not a good choice for people who frequently\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1266Eye glasses and contact lensesGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1266remove their glasses and put them on again. They are also\nnot very suitable for lenses that correct a high degree offarsightedness, because such lenses are thin at the edges.\nMetal frames are less noticeable than plastic, and\nthey are lightweight. They are available in solid gold,gold-filled, anodized aluminum, nickel, silver, stainlesssteel, and now titanium and titanium alloy. Until the late1980s, when titanium-nickel alloy and titanium frameswere introduced, metal frames were, in general, morefragile than plastic frames. The titanium frames, howev-er, are very strong and lightweight. An alloy of titaniumand nickel, called Flexon, is not only strong and light-weight, but returns to its original shape after being twist-ed or dented. It is not perfect for everyone, though,because some people are sensitive to its nickel. Flexonframes are also relatively expensive.\nPlastic frames are durable, can accommodate just\nabout any lens prescription, and are available in a widerange of prices. They are also offered in a variety of plas-tics (including acrylic, epoxy, cellulose acetate, cellulosepropionate, polyamide, and nylon) and in different colors,shapes, and levels of resistance to breakage. Epoxyframes are resilient and return to their original shape afterbeing deformed, so they do not need to be adjusted as fre-quently as other types. Nylon frames are almost unbreak-able. They revert to their original shape after extremetrauma and distortion; because of this property, though,they cannot be readjusted after they are manufactured.\nFIT. The patient should have the distance between\nthe eyes (PD) measured, so that the optical centers of thelenses will be in front of the patient’s pupils. Bifocalheights also have to be measured with the chosen framein place and adjusted on the patient. Again, this is so thelenses will be positioned correctly. If not positioned cor-rectly, the patient may experience eyestrain or otherproblems. This can occur with over-the-counter readingglasses. The distance between the lenses is for a “stan-dard” person. Generally, this will not be a problem, but ifa patient is sensitive or has more closely set eyes, forexample, it may pose a problem. Persons buying ready-made sunglasses or reading glasses should hold them upto see if they appear clear. They should also hold thelenses to see an object with straight lines reflected off ofthe lenses. If the lines don’t appear straight, the lensesmay be warped or inferior.\nPatients may sometimes need a few days to adjust to\na new prescription; however, problems should be report-ed, because the glasses may need to be rechecked.\nContact lenses\nOver 32 million people in the United States wear\nthese small lenses that fit on top of the cornea. They pro-vide a field of view unobstructed by eyeglass frames;\nthey do not fog-up or get splattered, so it is possible tosee well while walking in the rain; and they are lessnoticeable than any eyeglass style. On the other hand,they take time to get accustomed to; require more mea-surements for fitting; require many follow-up visits tothe eye doctor; can lead to complications such as infec-tions and corneal damage; and may not correct astigma-tism as well as eyeglasses, especially if the astigmatismis severe.\nOriginally, hard contact lenses were made of a mate-\nrial called PMMA. Although still available, the morecommon types of contact lenses are listed below:\n• Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) daily-wear lenses are made\nof plastic that does not absorb water but allows oxygento get from the atmosphere to the cornea. (This isimportant because the cornea has no blood supply andneeds to get its oxygen from the atmosphere throughthe film of tears that moves beneath the lens.) Theymust be removed and cleaned each night.\n• Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) extended-wear lenses are\nmade from plastic that also does not absorb water but ismore permeable to oxygen than the plastic used fordaily-wear lenses. They can be worn up to a week.\n• Daily wear soft lenses are made of plastic that is per-\nmeable to oxygen and absorbs water; therefore, theyare soft and flexible. These lenses must be removedand cleaned each night, and they do not correct allvision problems. Soft lenses are easier to get used tothan rigid lenses, but are more prone to tears and donot last as long.\n• Extended-wear soft lenses are highly permeable to oxy-\ngen, are flexible by virtue of their ability to absorbwater, and can usually be worn for up to one week.They do not correct all vision problems. There is moreof a risk of infection with extended-wear lenses thanwith daily-wear lenses.\n• Extended-wear disposable lenses are soft lenses worn\ncontinually for up to six days and then discarded, withno need for cleaning.\n• Planned-replacement soft lenses are daily wear lenses\nthat are replaced on a regular schedule, which is usuallyevery two weeks, monthly, or quarterly. They must alsobe cleaned.\nSoft contact lenses come in a variety of materials.\nThere are also different kinds of RGP and soft multifocalcontact lenses available. Monovision, where one contactlens corrects for distance vision while the other correctsfor near vision, may be an option for presbyopic patients.Monovision, however, may affect depth perception andmay not be appropriate for everyone. Contact lenses also\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1267Eye glasses and contact lensesGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1267come in a variety of tints. Soft contacts are available that\ncan change dark-colored eyes a different color. Eventhough such lenses have no prescription, they must stillbe fitted and checked to make sure that an eye infectiondoes not occur. People should NEVER wear someoneelse’s contact lenses. This can lead to infection or dam-age to the eye.\nAftercare\nContact lens wearers must be examined periodical-\nly by their eye doctors to make sure that the lenses fitproperly and that there is no infection. Both infectionand lenses that do not fit properly can damage thecornea. Patients can be allergic to certain solutions thatare used to clean or lubricate the lenses. For that reason,patients should not randomly switch products unlessthey speak with their doctor. Contact lens wearersshould seek immediate attention if they experience eyepain , a burning sensation, red eyes, intolerable sensitiv-\nity to light, cloudy vision, or an inability to keep theeyes open.\nTo avoid infection, it is important for contact lens\nwearers to exactly follow their instructions for lens inser-tion and removal, as well as cleaning. Soft contact lenswearers should never use tap water to rinse their lenses orto make-up solutions. All contact lens wearers shouldalso always have a pair of glasses and a carrying case fortheir contacts with them, in case the contacts have to beremoved due to eye irritation.KEY TERMS\nAstigmatism —Assymetric vision defects due to\nirregularities in the cornea.\nCornea —The clear outer covering of the front of the\neye.\nIndex of refraction —A constant number for any\nmaterial for any given color of light that is an indi-cator of the degree of the bending of the lightcaused by that material.\nLens—A device that bends light waves.\nPermeable —Capable of allowing substances to pass\nthrough.\nPolycarbonate —A very strong type of plastic often\nused in safety glasses, sport glasses, and children’seyeglasses.

To achieve binocular vision, thegoal is to align the eyes so that the location of the imageon the retina of one eye corresponds to the location of theimage on the retina of the other eye.\nIn addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help\npeople with other eye disorders ( nystagmus and Duane\nsyndrome, for example).\nPrecautions\nDepth perception (stereopsis) develops around the\nage of three months old. For successful development ofbinocular vision and the ability to perceive three-dimen-sionally, the surgery should not be postponed past the ageof four. The earlier the surgery the better the outcome, soan early diagnosis is important. Surgery may even beperformed before two years old. After surgery, if binocu-lar vision is to develop, corrective lenses and eye exercis-es (vision therapy) will probably be necessary.\nDescription\nThe extraocular muscles attach via tendons to the\nsclera (the white, opaque, outer protective covering ofthe eyeball) at different places just behind an imaginaryequator circling the top, bottom, left, and right of the eye.The other end of each of these muscles attaches to a partof the orbit (the eye socket in the skull). These musclesenable the eyes to move up, down, to one side or theother, or any angle in between.\nNormally both eyes move together, receive the same\nimage on corresponding locations on both retinas, and thebrain fuses these images into one three-dimensionalimage. The exception is in strabismus which is a disorder\nwhere one or both eyes deviate out of alignment, mostoften outwardly (exotropia) or toward the nose(esotropia). The brain now receives two different images,and either suppresses one or the person sees double(diplopia). This deviation can be adjusted by weakeningor strengthening the appropriate muscles to move the eyestoward the center. For example, if an eye turns upward,the muscle at the bottom of the eye could be strengthened.\nRarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people\nwith nystagmus or Duane syndrome. Nystagmus is a con-dition where one or both eyes move rapidly or oscillate; itcan sometimes be helped by moving the eyes to the posi-tion of least oscillation. Duane syndrome is a disorderwhere there is limited horizontal eye movement; it cansometimes be relieved by surgery to weaken an eye muscle.\nThere are two methods to alter extraocular muscles.\nTraditional surgery can be used to strengthen, weaken, orreposition an extraocular muscle. The surgeon firstmakes an incision in the conjunctiva (the clear membranecovering the sclera), then puts a suture into the muscle toprevent it from getting lost and loosens the muscle fromthe eyeball with a surgical hook. During a resection, themuscle is detached from the sclera, a piece of muscle isremoved so the muscle is now shorter, and the muscle isreattached to the same place. This strengths the muscle.In a recession, the muscle is made weaker by reposition-ing it. More than one extraocular eye muscle might beoperated on at the same time.\nAnother way of weakening eye muscles, using botu-\nlinum toxin injected into the muscle, was introduced inthe early 1980s. Although the botulinum toxin wears off,the realignment may be permanent, depending uponwhether neurological connections for binocular visionwere established during the time the toxin was active.This technique can also be used to adjust a muscle aftertraditional surgery.\nThe cost of eye muscle surgery is about $2,000–\n$4,000, and about 700,000 surgeries are performed annu-ally in the United States.\nPreparation\nPatients should make sure their doctors are aware of\nany medications that they are taking, even over-the-counter medications. Patients should not take aspirin ,o r\nany other blood-thinning medications for ten days priorto surgery, and should not eat or drink after midnight thenight before.\nAftercare\nPatients will need someone to drive them home after\ntheir surgery. They should continue to avoid aspirin andother non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for an addi-tional three days, but they can take acetaminophen (e.g.,\nTylenol). Patients should discuss this with the surgeon tobe clear what medications they can or cannot take. Pain\nwill subside after two to three days, and patients canresume most normal activities within a few days. Again,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1269Eye muscle surgeryGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1269this may vary with the patient and the patient should dis-\ncuss returning to normal activity with the surgeon. Theyshould not get their eyes wet for three to four days andshould refrain from swimming for 10 days. Operated eyeswill be red for about two weeks.\nRisks\nAs with any surgery, there are risks involved. Eye\nmuscle surgery is relatively safe, but very rarely a cutmuscle gets lost and can not be retrieved. This, and otherserious reactions, including those caused by anesthetics,can result in vision loss in the affected eye. Occasionally,retinal or nerve damage occurs. Double vision is notuncommon after eye muscle surgery.

    "content": "Eyelid disorders\nDefinition\nAn eyelid disorder is any abnormal condition that\naffects the eyelids.\nDescription\nEyelids consist of thin folds of skin, muscle, and\nconnective tissue. The eyelids protect the eyes and spreadtears over the front of the eyes. The inside of the eyelidsare lined with the conjunctiva of the eyelid (the palpebralconjunctiva), and the outside of the lids are covered withthe body’s thinnest skin. Some common lid problemsinclude the following: stye, blepharitis, chalazion, entro-pion, ectropion, eyelid edema , and eyelid tumors.\nStye\nA stye is an infection of one of the three types of eye-\nlid glands near the lid margins, at the base of the lashes.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1270Eyelid disordersGEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1270Chalazion\nA chalazion is an enlargement of a meibomian gland\n(an oil-producing gland in the eyelid), usually not associ-ated with an infectious agent. More likely, the glandopening is clogged. Initially, a chalazion may resemble astye, but it usually grows larger. A chalazion may also belocated in the middle of the lid and be internal.\nBlepharitis\nBlepharitis is the inflammation of the eyelid mar-\ngins, often with scales and crust. It can lead to eyelashloss, chalazia, styes, ectropion, corneal damage, exces-sive tearing, and chronic conjunctivitis .\nEntropion\nEntropion is a condition where the eyelid margin\n(usually the lower one) is turned inward; the eyelashestouch the eye and irritate the cornea.\nEctropion\nEctropion is a condition where one or both eyelid\nmargins turn outward, exposing both the conjunctiva thatcovers the eye and the conjunctiva that lines the eyelid.\nEyelid edema\nEyelid edema is a condition where the eyelids con-\ntain excessive fluid.\nEyelid tumors\nEyelids are susceptible to the same skin tumors as\nthe skin over the rest of the body, including noncancer-ous tumors and cancerous tumors (basal cell carcinoma,squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma , and\nsebaceous gland carcinoma). Eyelid muscles are suscep-tible to sarcoma.\nCauses and symptoms\nStye\nStyes are usually caused by bacterial staphylococcal\ninfections . The symptoms are pain and inflammation in\none or more localized regions near the eyelid margin.\nChalazion\nA chalazion is caused by a blockage in the outflow\nduct of a meibomian gland. Symptoms are inflammationand swelling in the form of a round lump in the lid thatmay be painful.\nBlepharitis\nSome cases of blepharitis are caused by bacterial\ninfection and some by head lice, but in some cases, thecause is unclear. It may also be caused by an overproduc-\ntion of oil by the meibomian glands. Blepharitis can be achronic condition that begins in early childhood and canlast throughout life. Symptoms can include itching , burn-\ning, a feeling that something is in the eye, inflammation,and scales or matted, hard crusts surrounding the eyelashes.\nEntropion\nEntropion usually results from aging , but sometimes\ncan be due to a congenital defect, a spastic eyelid muscle,or a scar on the inside of the lid that could be fromsurgery, injury, or disease. It is accompanied by exces-sive tearing, redness, and discomfort.\nEctropion\nSimilar to entropion, the usual cause of ectropion is\naging. It also can be due to a spastic eyelid muscle or ascar, as in entropion. It also can be the result of allergies .\nSymptoms are excessive tearing and hardening of theeyelid conjunctiva.\nEyelid edema\nEyelid edema is most often caused by allergic reac-\ntions, for example, allergies to eye makeup, eyedrops orother drugs, or plant allergens such as pollen. Trichinosis ,\na disease caused by eating undercooked meat, also causeseyelid edema. However, swelling can also be caused bymore serious causes, such as infection, and can lead toorbital cellulitis which can threaten vision. Symptoms can\ninclude swelling, itching, redness, or pain.\nEyelid tumors\nTumors found on the eyelids are caused by the same\nconditions that cause these tumors elsewhere on the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1271Eyelid disorders\nA chalazion on the eyelid.This condition is caused by an\nobstruction of one of the meibomian glands which lubricatethe edge of the eyelid. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced\nby permission.)GEM -1121 to 1274 - E  10/22/03 6:15 PM  Page 1271body. They are usually painless and may or may not be\npigmented. Some possible causes include AIDS\n(Kaposi’s sarcoma ) or increased exposure to ultraviolet\n(UV) rays which may lead to skin cancer .\nDiagnosis\nAn instrument called a slit lamp is generally used to\nmagnify the structures of the eyes. The doctor may presson the lid margin to see if oil can be expressed from themeibomian glands. The doctor may invert the lid to seethe inside of the lid. Biopsy is used to diagnose cancer-ous tumors.\nTreatment\nStye\nStyes are treated with warm-hot compresses for\n10–15 minutes, three to four times a day. Sometimes top-ical antibiotics may be prescribed. If the initial treatment\nis ineffective, styes are lanced and drained.\nChalazion\nAbout 25% of chalazia will disappear spontaneous-\nly, but hot compresses may speed the process. Becausechalazia are inside the lid, topical medications are gener-ally of no benefit. Medication may need to be injected bythe doctor into the chalazion or if that doesn’t help thechalazion may need to be excised. If what appears to be achalazion recurs on the same site as any previous one, thepossibility of sebaceous gland carcinoma should beinvestigated by biopsy.Blepharitis\nBlepharitis is treated with hot compresses, with\nantibiotic ointment, and by cleaning the eyelids with amoist washcloth and then with baby shampoo. Goodhygiene is essential. If the blepharitis doesn’t clear upwith treatment or if it seems to be a chronic problem, thepatient may have acnerosacea . These patients may need\nto see a dermatologist as well.\nEntropion and ectropion\nBoth entropion and ectropion can be surgically cor-\nrected. Prior to surgery, the lower lid of entropion can betaped down to keep the lashes off the eye, and both can betreated with lubricating drops to keep the cornea moist.\nEyelid edema\nPatients with swollen eyelids should contact their\neye doctor. A severely swollen lid can press on the eyeand possibly increase the intraocular pressure. An infec-tion needs to be ruled out. Or, something as simple as anallergy to nail polish and then touching the eyes cancause swelling. The best treatment for allergic eyelidedema is to find and remove the substance causing theallergy. When that is not possible, as in the case of plantallergens, cold compresses and immunosuppresesivedrugs such as corticosteroid creams are helpful. Howev-er, steroids can cause cataracts and increase intraocular\npressure and patients must be very careful not to get thecream in their eyes. This should not be done unless undera doctor’s care. For edema caused by trichinosis, thetrichinosis must be treated.\nEyelid tumors\nCancerous tumors should be removed upon discov-\nery, and noncancerous tumors should be removed beforethey become big enough to interfere with vision or eyelidfunction. Eyelid tumors require special considerationbecause of their sensitive location. It is important thattreatment not compromise vision, eye movement, or eye-lid movement. Accordingly, eyelid reconstruction willsometimes accompany tumor excision.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for styes and chalazia is good to\nexcellent. With treatment, blepharitis, ectropion, andentropion usually have good outcomes. The prognosisfor nonmalignant tumors, basal cell carcinoma, and squa-mous cell carcinoma is good once they are properlyremoved. Survival rate for malignant melanoma dependsupon how early it was discovered and if it was complete-ly removed. Sebaceous carcinomas are difficult to detect,so poor outcomes are more frequent.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1272Eyelid disorders\nA close-up of the eye of an elderly patient showing ectropi-\non of the lower eyelid. Ectropion is a condition in which theeyelid turns away from the eye.The most common type issenile ectropion (seen here), in which the droop of the eye-lid is due to loss of tissue elasticity in old age and weak-ness in the muscles surrounding the eye. (Photograph by Dr.\nP . Marazzi, Photo Researchers, Inc.

An oph-\nthalmologist or optometrist should be consulted.\nPrevention\nGood lid hygiene is very important. Regular eyelid\nwashing with baby shampoo helps prevent styes, cha-lazia, blepharitis, and eyelid edema. To avoid these prob-lems, it’s also important to refrain from touching andrubbing the eyes and eyelids, especially with hands thathave not just been washed.\nBlepharitis is associated with dandruff, which is\ncaused by a kind of bacteria that is one of the causes ofblepharitis. Controlling dandruff by washing the hair,scalp, and eyebrows with shampoo containing seleniumsulfide to kill the bacteria helps control the blepharitis.When using anything near the eyes, it is important toread the label or consult with a doctor first.\nAvoiding allergens helps prevent allergic eyelid\nedema. Staying inside as much as possible when pollencounts are high and eliminating the use of, or at leastremoving eye makeup thoroughly, or using hypo-aller-genic makeup may help if the person is sensitive to thosesubstances.\nSunscreen, UV-blocking sunglasses, and wide brim-\nmed hats can help prevent eyelid tumors.\nEntropian and ectropian seem to be unpreventable.\nResources\nBOOKS\nNewell, Frank W.

    "title": "Face lift",
    "content": "Face lift\nDefinition\nFace lift surgery is a cosmetic procedure that involves\nredirecting some of the skin and muscle tissue of the faceand neck to counter signs of aging produced by gravity.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of face lift surgery, also known as\nfacialplasty, rhytidoplasty, or cervicofacial rhytidectomy,is to improve the appearance of the face by repositioningthe skin and tightening some of the underlying muscleand tissue. The procedure is designed to counter saggingand looseness in skin and muscle tissue caused by gravi-ty as the patient ages. Face lift surgery will not erase allfacial wrinkles, as the term rhytidectomy (which literallymeans “surgical removal of wrinkles”) might imply.Wrinkles around the mouth and eyes, for example, maybenefit little from face lift surgery. Other procedures,such as blepharoplasty , chemical peel, or dermabrasion,\nalso may be necessary.\nPrecautions\nPatients with other medical conditions should consult\nwith their primary physician before undergoing face liftsurgery. Lung problems, heart disease, and certain otherconditions can lead to a higher risk of complications.Patients who take medications that can alter the way theirblood clots (including female hormones, aspirin , and\nsome non-aspirin pain relievers) should stop these med-\nications prior to surgery to lower the risk that a hematomawill form. A hematoma, a pocket of blood below the skin,is the most frequent complication of face lift surgery.Description\nFace lift surgery can be performed on an outpatient\nbasis with local anesthetics. Patients typically alsoreceive “twilight anesthesia,” an intravenous sedative thathelps to lower their awareness of the procedure beingperformed.\nThere are a number of variations of face lift surgery.\nWhich one is used will depend on the patient’s facialstructure, how much correction is needed, and the prefer-ences of the surgeon performing the procedure. In a typi-cal face lift surgery, the surgeon begins by making an inci-sion within the hairline just above the ear. The incisioncontinues down along the front edge of the ear, around theearlobe, and then up and behind the ear extending backinto the hairline. The location of this incision is designedto hide any sign of the procedure later. The same proce-dure is repeated on the other side of the face. Using vari-ous instruments, the surgeon will then work to separate theskin of the face from its underlying tissue, moving downto the cheek and into the neck area and below the chin. Fatdeposits over the cheeks and in the neck may be removedsurgically or with liposuction at this time. The surgeon\nwill then work to free up and tighten certain bands of mus-cle and tissue that extend up from the shoulder, below thechin, and up and behind the neck. If these muscles and tis-sue are not tightened, the looseness and sagging appear-ance of the skin will return. The surgeon then trims excessskin from the edges of the original incision, pulls the skinback, and staples or sutures it into place.\nPreparation\nPrior to the procedure, patients meet with their sur-\ngeon to discuss the surgery, clarify the results that can beachieved, and discuss the potential problems that canoccur. Having realistic expectations is important in anycosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, thatalthough face lift surgery can improve the contour of theface and neck, other procedures will be necessary toreduce the appearance of many wrinkles. As mentionedF\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1275KEY TERMS\nHematoma —A complication of surgery in which a\ncollection of blood forms below the skin.\nRhytidectomy —It literally means “wrinkle exci-\nsion.” It is another, misleading, term for face liftsurgery.\nTwilight anesthesia —An intravenous mixture of\nsedatives and other medications that decreasespatients’ awareness of the procedure being per-formed.\nearlier, patients will stop taking aspirin, birth control or\nfemale hormones, and other medications affecting bloodclotting about two weeks before the procedure. Somephysicians prescribe vitamin C and K in the belief thatthis promotes healing. Patients will also be advised tostop smoking and to avoid exposure to passive smoke\nbefore the procedure and afterward. Some surgeons alsorecommend antibiotics be taken beforehand to limit the\nrisk of infection. Some surgeons also use a steroid injec-tion before or after the procedure, to reduce swelling.\nAftercare\nAfter the surgery, a pressure bandage will be applied\nto the face to reduce the risk of hematoma. The patientmay spend a few hours resting in a recovery room toensure no bleeding has occurred. The patient then returnshome. Some surgeons recommend that the patient remainreclining for the next 24 hours, consuming a liquid diet,and avoiding any movements that lead the neck to flex. Icepacks for the first few days can help to reduce swellingand lower the risk of hematoma. Patients continue takingan antibiotic until the first stitches come out about fivedays after the procedure. The balance are removed seven\nto 10 days later. Many patients return to work and limitedactivities within two weeks of the procedure.\nRisks\nThe major complication seen following face lift\nsurgery is a hematoma. If a hematoma forms, the patientmay have to return to have the stitches reopened to findthe source of the bleeding. Most hematomas form within48 hours of surgery. The typical sign is pain or swellingaffecting one side of the face but not the other.\nAnother risk of face lift surgery is nerve damage.\nSometimes it can affect the patient’s ability to raise aneyebrow, or distort his smile, or leave him with limitedfeeling in his earlobe. Most of these nerve injuries, how-ever, repair themselves within 2–6 months.\nNormal results\nSome swelling and bruising is normal following face\nlift surgery. After these disappear, the patient should seea noticeable improvement in the contour of his face andneck. Some fine wrinkling of the skin may be improved,but deep wrinkles are likely to require another cosmeticprocedure to improve their appearance.\nAbnormal results\nIn addition to the risks outlined above, other compli-\ncations of face lift surgery include infection, scarring,and hair loss near incision lines.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAsken, Saul. “Cervicofacial Rhytidectomy.” In Cosmetic\nSurgery of the Skin: Principles and Techniques ,e d .\nWilliam P.

    "title": "Factitious disorders",
    "content": "Factitious disorders\nDefinition\nFactitious disorders are a group of mental distur-\nbances in which patients intentionally act physically ormentally ill without obvious benefits. The name facti-tious comes from a Latin word that means artificial.These disorders are not malingering , which is defined as\npretending illness when the “patient” has a clear motive,such as financial gain.\nDescription\nPatients with factitious disorders produce or exag-\ngerate the symptoms of a physical or mental illness by avariety of methods, including contaminating urine sam-ples with blood, taking hallucinogens, injecting them-selves with bacteria to produce infections, and other sim-ilar behaviors.\nThere are no reliable statistics on the frequency of\nfactitious disorders, but they are more common in menthan in women. The following conditions are sometimesclassified as factitious disorders:\nMunchausen syndrome\nMunchausen syndrome refers to patients whose\nfactitious symptoms are dramatized and exaggerated.Many persons with Munchausen go so far as to undergomajor surgery repeatedly, and, to avoid detection, at sev-eral locations. Many have been employed in hospitals orin health care professions. The syndrome’s onset is inearly adulthood.\nMunchausen by proxy\nMunchausen by proxy is the name given to facti-\ntious disorders in children produced by parents orother caregivers. The parent may falsify the child’smedical history or tamper with laboratory tests inorder to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, theymay actually injure the child to assure that the childwill be treated.\nGanser’s syndrome\nGanser’s syndrome is an unusual dissociative reac-\ntion to extreme stress in which the patient gives absurd\nor silly answers to simple questions. It has sometimesbeen labeled as psychiatric malingering, but is moreoften classified as a factitious disorder.\nCauses and symptoms\nNo single explanation of factitious disorders covers\nall cases. These disorders are variously attributed tounderlying personality disorders ; child abuse ; the wish\nto repeat a satisfying childhood relationship with a doc-tor; and the desire to deceive or test authority figures.Also, the wish to assume the role of patient and be caredfor is involved. In many cases, the suffering of a majorpersonal loss has been implicated.\nThe following are regarded as indications of a facti-\ntious disorder:\n• dramatic but inconsistent medical history• extensive knowledge of medicine and/or hospitals• negative test results followed by further symptom\ndevelopment\n• symptoms that occur only when the patient is not being\nobserved\n• few visitors• arguments with hospital staff or similar acting-out\nbehaviors\n• eagerness to undergo operations and other procedures\nWhen patients with factitious disorders are confront-\ned, they usually deny that their symptoms are intentional.They may become angry and leave the hospital. In manycases they enter another hospital, which has led to thenickname “hospital hoboes.”\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1277Factitious disordersDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of factitious disorders is usually based on\nthe exclusion of bona fide medical or psychiatric condi-tions, together with a combination of the signs listed ear-lier. In some cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis ofrecords from other hospitals.\nTreatment\nTreatment of factitious disorders is usually limited\nto prompt recognition of the condition and the refusal togive unnecessary medications or to perform unneededprocedures. Factitious disorder patients do not usuallyremain in the hospital long enough for effective psychi-atric treatment. Some clinicians have tried psychothera-peutic treatment for factitious disorder patients, and thereare anecdotal reports that antidepressant or antipsychoticmedications are helpful in certain cases.\nPrognosis\nSome patients have only one or two episodes of fac-\ntitious disorders; others develop a chronic form that maybe lifelong.

    "title": "Failure to thrive",
    "content": "Failure to thrive\nDefinition\nFailure to thrive (FTT) is used to describe a delay in\na child’s growth or development. It is usually applied toinfants and children up to two years of age who do notgain or maintain weight as they should. Failure to thriveis not a specific disease, but rather a cluster of symptomswhich may come from a variety of sources.\nDescription\nShortly after birth most infants loose some weight.\nAfter that expected loss, babies should gain weight at asteady and predictable rate. When a baby does not gainweigh as expected, or continues to loose weight, it is notthriving. Failure to thrive may be due to one or moreconditions.\nOrganic failure to thrive (OFTT) implies that the\norgans involved with digestion and absorption of foodare malformed or incomplete so the baby cannot digestits food. Non-organic failure to thrive (NOFTT) is themost common cause of FTT and implies the baby is notreceiving enough food due to economic factors orparental neglect, or do to psychosocial problems.\nCauses and symptoms\nOccasionally, there may be an underlying physical\ncondition that inhibits the baby’s ability to take in, digest,or process food. These defects can occur in the esopha-gus, stomach, small or large intestine, rectum or anus.Usually the defect is an incomplete development of theorgan, and it must be surgically corrected. Most physicaldefects can be detected shortly after birth.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1278Failure to thriveFailure to thrive may also result from lack of avail-\nable food or the quality of the food offered. This can bedue to economic factors in the family, parental beliefs andconcepts of nutrition , or neglect of the child. In addition,\nif the baby is being breast fed, the quality or quantity ofthe mother’s milk may be the source of the problem.\nPsychosocial problems, often stemming from a lack\nof nurturing parent-child relations can lead to a failure tothrive. The child may exhibit poor appetite due to depres-sion from insufficient attention from parents.\nInfants and toddlers, whose growth is substantially\nless than expected, are considered to be suffering fromFTT.\nDiagnosis\nMost babies are weighed at birth and that weight is\nused as a base line for future well-baby check-ups. If thebaby is not gaining weight at a predictable rate, the doc-tor will do a more extensive examination. If there are noapparent physical deformities in the digestive tract, thedoctor will examine the child’s environment. As part ofthat examination, the doctor will look at the family histo-ry of height and weight. In addition, the parents will beasked about feedings, illnesses, and family routines. Ifthe mother is breastfeeding the doctor will also evaluateher diet, general health, and well being as it affects thequantity and quality of her milk.\nDiagnosis of FTT is confirmed by a positive growth\nand behavioral response to increased nutrition.\nTreatment\nIf there is an underlying physical reason for failure\nto thrive, such as a disorder of swallowing mechanism orintestinal problems, correcting that problem shouldreverse the condition. If the condition is caused by envi-ronmental factors, the physician will suggest severalways parents may provide adequate food for the child.Maternal education and parental counseling may also berecommended. In extreme cases, hospitalization or amore nurturing home may be necessary.\nPrognosis\nThe first year of life is important as a foundation for\ngrowth and physical and intellectual development in thefuture. Children with extreme failure to thrive in the firstyear may never catch up to their peers even if their physi-cal growth improves. In about one third of these extremecases, mental development remains below normal androughly half will continue to have psychosocial and eat-ing problems throughout life.KEY TERMS\nEsophagus —The muscular tube which connects\nthe mouth and stomach.\nPsychosocial —A term referring to the mind’s abili-\nty to, consciously or unconsciously, adjust andrelate the body to its social environment.\nWhen failure to thrive is identified and corrected\nearly, most children catch up to their peers and remainhealthy and well developed.\nPrevention\nInitial failure to thrive caused by physical defects\ncannot be prevented but can often be corrected beforethey become a danger to the child. Maternal educationand emotional and economic support systems all help toprevent failure to thrive in those cases where there is nophysical deformity.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Humane Association, Children’s Division. 63 Inver-\nness Drive East, Englewood, CO 80112-5117.

    "title": "Fainting",
    "content": "Fainting\nDefinition\nFainting is loss of consciousness caused by a tempo-\nrary lack of oxygen to the brain. Known by the medicalterm “syncope,” fainting may be preceded by dizziness ,\nnausea, or a feeling of extreme weakness.\nDescription\nWhen a person faints, the loss of consciousness is\nbrief. The person will wake up as soon as normal bloodflow is restored to the brain. Blood flow is usually\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1279Faintingrestored by lying flat for a short time. This position puts\nthe head on the same level as the heart so that bloodflows more easily to the brain.\nA fainting episode may be completely harmless and\nof no significance, but it can be a symptom of a seriousunderlying disorder. No matter how trivial it seems, afainting episode should be treated as a medical emer-gency until the cause is determined.\nCauses and symptoms\nExtreme pain , fear, or stress may bring on fainting.\nThis type of fainting is caused by overstimulation of thevagus nerve, a nerve connected to the brain that helps con-trol breathing and circulation. In addition, a person whostands still or erect for too long may faint. This type offainting occurs because blood pools in the leg veins,reducing the amount that is available for the heart to pumpto the brain. This type of fainting is quite common in olderpeople or those taking drugs to treat high blood pressure.\nWhen an older person feels faint upon turning the\nhead or looking upward suddenly, the cause could beosteoarthritis of the neck bones. Osteoarthritis damages\nthe cartilage between the neck bones and causes pressureon blood vessels leading to the brain.\nFainting can be a symptom of a disease such as\nStokes-Adams syndrome, a condition in which bloodflow to the brain is temporarily reduced because of anirregular heartbeat. Some people may experience faintingassociated with weakness in the limbs or a temporary\nproblem in speaking caused by obstructed blood flow invessels passing through the neck to the brain. Pregnantwomen frequently feel faint. Fainting may also occur as aresult of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar can occur if aperson skips a meal or has diabetes.\nFainting can also be caused by:\n• prolonged coughing\n• straining to defecate or urinate• blowing a wind instrument too hard\n• remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen\nSometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary\ndrop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a tran-\nsient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a\nmini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to thebrain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel. Seekhelp immediately if a fainting spell is followed by one ormore of the symptoms listed below:\n• numbness or tingling in any body part\n• blurred vision\n• confusion• difficulty speaking\n• loss of movement in arms or legs\nA few seconds before fainting, a person may sweat\nor become pale, feel nauseated or dizzy, and have blurredvision or racing heartbeat. Once the person loses con-sciousness, the pupils may dilate as the heart rate slowsdown. There may be abnormal movements. Muscles maytighten or the back may arch. These movements do notlast long and they are not violent.\nIn most cases, the patient regains consciousness\nwithin a few minutes, but the fainting spell may be fol-lowed by nervousness, headache , nausea, dizziness, pal-\nlor or sweating. The person may faint again, especially ifhe or she stands up within 30 minutes.\nDiagnosis\nMost episodes of fainting are a one-time occurrence.\nWhen a person experiences repeated fainting spells, aphysician should be consulted.\nTreatment\nMost of the time, a person who faints ends up lying\non the floor. If this happens, the patient should be rolledonto his or her back. Because someone who faints oftenvomits, bystanders should keep the airway open. A per-son who is fainting should not be held upright or in a sit-ting position. These positions prevent blood flow to thebrain and may bring on a seizure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1280Fainting\nIf a person is feeling faint, unconsciousness may be pre-\nvented by sitting with the head between the knees, asshown in the illustration above, or by lying flat with the legsraised.

If there areno signs of breathing or heart rate, the problem is moreserious than fainting, and cardiopulmonary resuscita-\ntion (CPR ) must begin.\nIf breathing and pulse rates seem normal, the person’s\nlegs should be raised above the level of the head so thatgravity can help the blood flow to the brain. Belts, collarsor any other constrictive clothing should be loosened.\nIf the person does not regain consciousness within a\nminute or two after fainting, medical help should besummoned.\nPrognosis\nAfter a fainting spell, the person should regain nor-\nmal color but may continue to feel weak for a short time.Lying down quietly for a few moments may help.\nIn most cases, an attack of fainting is not serious. As\nsoon as the underlying pain or stress passes, the dangerof repeated episodes also is eliminated.\nPrevention\nIf a person is feeling faint, unconsciousness may be\nprevented by sitting with the head between the knees orlying flat with the legs raised.KEY TERMS\nOsteoarthritis —A disease characterized by dam-\nage to the cartilage in the joints.

    "title": "Familial Mediterranean fever",
    "content": "Familial Mediterranean fever\nDefinition\nFamilial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited\ndisorder of the inflammatory response characterized byrecurring attacks of fever, accompanied by intense pain\nin the abdomen, chest, or joints. Attacks usually last12–72 hours, and can occasionally involve a skin rash.Kidney disease is a serious concern if the disorder is nottreated. FMF is most prevalent in people of Armenian,Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, and Turkish ancestry.\nDescription\nFMF could be described as a disorder of “inappro-\npriate” inflammation. That is, an event that in a normalsituation causes a mild or unnoticeable inflammationmight cause a severe inflammatory response in someonewith FMF. Certain areas of the body are at risk for FMF-related symptoms. A serosa is a serous (fluid-producing)membrane that can be found inside the abdominal cavity(peritoneum), around the lungs (pleura), around the heart(pericardium), and inside the joints (synovium). Thesymptoms of FMF are due to inflammation of one ormore of the serosal membranes (serositis). Thus, FMF isalso sometimes called recurrent polyserositis.\nDuring an attack, large numbers of neutrophils, a\ntype of white blood cell, move into the affected areas\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1281Familial Mediterranean fevercausing painful inflammation and fever. These\nepisodes may be accompanied by a skin rash or jointpain. In a few cases, chronic arthritis is a problem.Amyloidosis is a potentially serious condition in\nwhich proteins called amyloids are mistakenly pro-duced and deposited in organs and tissues throughoutthe body. Left untreated, amyloidosis often leads tokidney failure, which is the major long-term healthrisk in FMF.\nIn most cases, the attacks of fever and pain are first\nnoticed in childhood or adolescence. The intervalbetween these episodes may be days or months, and isnot predictable. However, during these intervals peoplewith FMF typically lead normal lives. It is not entirelyclear what brings on an attack, but people with FMFoften report mild physical trauma, physical exertion, oremotional stress just prior to the onset of symptoms.\nTreatment for FMF involves an oral medication calledcolchicine, which is highly effective for the episodes offever and pain, as well as for amyloidosis and the kidneydisease that can result from it.\nFMF is most common in certain ethnic groups from\nthe eastern Mediterranean region, but cases in other eth-nic groups in other parts of the world are increasinglybeing reported. FMF is also known by many othernames. They include: recurrent hereditary polyserositis,benign paroxysmal peritonitis , familial paroxysmal pol-\nyserositis, paroxysmal polyserositis, familial recurrentpolyserositis, periodic fever, periodic amyloid syndrome,periodic peritonitis syndrome, Reimann periodic disease,Reimann syndrome, Siegel-Cattan-Mamou syndrome,and Armenian syndrome.\nEstimates of the incidence of FMF in specific east-\nern Mediterranean populations range from 1 in 2000 to 1in 100, depending on the population studied. Specificmutations in the MEFV gene are more common in cer-tain ethnic groups, and may cause a somewhat differentcourse of the disease. A few mutations in the MEFVgene likely became common in a small population in theeastern Mediterranean several thousand years ago. It ispostulated that carrying a single copy of a mutated geneproduced a modified (but not abnormal) inflammatoryresponse that may have been protective against someinfectious agent at that time. Those who carried a single“beneficial” mutation in the MEFV gene were more like-ly to survive and reproduce, which may explain the highcarrier frequency (up to one in five) in some populations.People of Armenian, Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, andTurkish ancestry are at greatest risk for FMF. However, abetter understanding and recognition of the symptoms ofFMF in recent years has resulted in more reports of thecondition in other ethnic groups, such as Italians andArmenian-Americans.Causes and symptoms\nFMF is a genetic condition inherited in an autosomal\nrecessive fashion. Mutations in the MEFV gene (shortfor Mediterranean Fever) on chromosome number 16 arethe underlying cause of FMF. Autosomal recessive inher-itance implies that a person with FMF has mutations inboth copies of the MEFV gene. All genes come in pairs,and one copy of each pair is inherited from each parent.If neither parent of a child with FMF has the condition, itmeans they carry one mutated copy of the MEFV gene,but also one normal copy, which is enough to protectthem from disease. If both parents carry the same autoso-mal recessive gene, there is a one in four chance in eachpregnancy that the child will inherit both recessive\ngenes, and thus have the condition.\nThe MEFV gene carries the instructions for produc-\ntion of a protein called pyrin, named for pyrexia, a med-ical term for fever. The research group in France that co-discovered the protein named it marenostrin, after ancientLatin words that referred to the Mediterranean Sea. Themovement of neutrophils into an area of the body wheretrauma or infection has occurred is the major cause ofinflammation, which is a normal process. Research hasshown that pyrin has some function in controlling neu-trophils. In a situation where minor trauma or stressoccurs, some initial inflammation may follow, but a func-tional pyrin protein is responsible for shutting-down theresponse of neutrophils once they are no longer needed.An abnormal pyrin protein associated with FMF may bepartly functional, but unstable. In some instances, theabnormal pyrin itself seems to be “stressed”, and loses itsability to regulate neutrophils and inflammation. Leftunregulated, a normal, mild inflammation spirals out ofcontrol. Exactly what causes pyrin in FMF to lose its abil-ity to control neutrophils in some situations is not known.\nThe recurrent acute attacks of FMF typically begin\nin childhood or adolescence. Episodes of fever andpainful inflammation usually last 12–72 hours. About90% of people with FMF have their first attack by age20. The group of symptoms that characterizes FMFincludes the following:\nFever\nAn FMF attack is nearly always accompanied by a\nfever, but it may not be noticed in every case. Fevers aretypically 100–104°F (38–40°C). Some people experi-ence chills prior to the onset of fever.\nAbdominal pain\nNearly all people with FMF experience abdominal\npain at one point or another, and for most it is the most\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1282Familial Mediterranean fevercommon complaint. The pain can range from mild to\nsevere, and can be diffuse or localized. It can mimicappendicitis , and many people with undiagnosed FMF\nhave had appendectomies or exploratory surgery of theabdomen done, only to have the fever and abdominalpain return.\nChest pain\nPleuritis, also called pleurisy , occurs in up to half of\nthe affected individuals in certain ethnic groups. Thepain is usually on one side of the chest. Pericarditis\nwould also be felt as chest pain.\nJoint pain\nAbout 50% of people with FMF experience joint\npain during attacks. The pain is usually confined to onejoint at a time, and often involves the hip, knee, or ankle.For some people, however, the recurrent joint painbecomes chronic arthritis.\nMyalgia\nUp to 20% of individuals report muscle pain. These\nepisodes typically last less than two days, and tend tooccur in the evening or after physical exertion. Rarecases of muscle pain and fever lasting up to one monthhave been reported.KEY TERMS\nAcute phase reactants —Blood proteins whose con-\ncentrations increase or decrease in reaction to theinflammation process.\nAmyloid —A waxy translucent substance composed\nmostly of protein, that forms plaques (abnormaldeposits) in the brain.\nAmyloidosis —Accumulation of amyloid deposits in\nvarious organs and tissues in the body such thatnormal functioning of an organ is compromised.\nColchicine —A compound that blocks the assembly\nof microtubules–protein fibers necessary for celldivision and some kinds of cell movements, includ-ing neutrophil migration. Side effects may includediarrhea, abdominal bloating, and gas.\nLeukocyte —A white blood cell. The neutrophils are\na type of leukocyte.\nLeukocytosis —An increase in the number of leuko-\ncytes in the blood.Neutrophil —The primary type of white blood cell\ninvolved in inflammation. Neutrophils are a type ofgranulocyte, also known as a polymorphonuclearleukocyte.\nPericarditis —Inflammation of the pericardium, the\nmembrane surrounding the heart.\nPeritonitis —Inflammation of the peritoneum, the\nmembrane surrounding the abdominal contents.\nPleuritis —Inflammation of the pleura, the mem-\nbrane surrounding the lungs.\nPyrexia —A medical term denoting fevers.\nSerositis —Inflammation of a serosal membrane.\nPolyserositis refers to the inflammation of two ormore serosal membranes.\nSynovitis —Inflammation of the synovium, a mem-\nbrane found inside joints.\nSkin rash\nA rash, described as erysipelas-like erythema,\naccompanies attacks in a minority of people, and mostoften occurs on the front of the lower leg or top of thefoot. The rash appears as a red, warm, swollen area about4–6 in (10–15 cm) in diameter.\nAmyloidosis\nFMF is associated with high levels in the blood of\na protein called serum amyloid A (SAA). Over time,excess SAA tends to be deposited in tissues and organsthroughout the body. The presence and deposition ofexcess SAA is known as amyloidosis. Amyloidosismay affect the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen,heart, and testes, but effects on the kidneys are ofgreatest concern. The frequency of amyloidosis variesamong the different ethnic groups, and its overall inci-dence is difficult to determine because of the use ofcolchicine to avert the problem. Left untreated, howev-er, those individuals who do develop amyloidosis ofthe kidneys may require a renal transplant, or may evendie of renal failure. The frequency and severity of aperson’s attacks of fever and serositis seem to have norelation to whether they will develop amyloidosis. Infact, a few people with FMF have been described whohave had amyloidosis but apparently no other FMF-related symptoms.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1283Familial Mediterranean feverOther symptoms\nA small percentage of boys with FMF develop\npainful inflammation around the testes, headaches are acommon occurrence during attacks, and certain types ofvasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) seem to be\nmore common in FMF.\nDiagnosis\nIndividually, the symptoms that define FMF are com-\nmon. Fevers occur for many reasons, and nonspecificpains in the abdomen, chest, and joints are also frequentailments. Several infections can result in symptoms simi-lar to FMF (Mallaret meningitis , for instance), and many\npeople with FMF undergo exploratory abdominal surgeryand ineffective treatments before they are finally diag-nosed. Membership in a less commonly affected ethnicgroup may delay or hinder the correct diagnosis.\nIn general, symptoms involving one or more of the\nfollowing broad groups should lead to suspicion of FMF:Unexplained recurrent fevers, polyserositis, skin rash,and/or joint pain; abnormal blood studies (see below);and renal or other disease associated with amyloidosis. Afamily history of FMF or its symptoms would obviouslybe an important clue, but the recessive nature of FMFmeans there usually is no family history. The diagnosismay be confirmed when a person with unexplained feverand pain responds to treatment with colchicine sincecolchicine is not known to have a beneficial effect on anyother condition similar to FMF. Abnormal results on ablood test typically include leukocytosis (elevated num-\nber of neutrophils in the blood), an increased erythro-\ncyte sedimentation rate (rate at which red blood cells\nform a sediment in a blood sample), and increased levelsof proteins associated with inflammation (called acutephase reactants) such as SAA.\nDirect analysis of the MEFV gene for FMF muta-\ntions is the only method to be certain of the diagnosis.However, it is not yet possible to detect all MEFV genemutations that might cause FMF. Thus, if DNA analysisis negative, clinical methods must be relied upon. If bothmembers of a couple were proven to be FMF carriersthrough genetic testing , highly accurate prenatal diagno-\nsis would be available in any subsequent pregnancy.\nSimilar syndromes of periodic fever and inflamma-\ntion include familial Hibernian fever and hyperim-munoglobulinemia D syndrome, but both are more rarethan FMF.\nTreatment\nColchicine is a chemical compound that can be used\nas a medication, and is frequently prescribed for gout .Some years ago, colchicine was discovered to also be\neffective in reducing the frequency and severity ofattacks in FMF. Treatment for FMF at this point consistsof taking colchicine daily. Studies have shown that about75% of FMF patients achieve complete remission oftheir symptoms, and about 95% show marked improve-ment when taking colchicine. Lower effectiveness hasbeen reported, but there is some question about the num-ber of FMF patients who choose not to take theircolchicine between attacks when they are feeling well,and thus lose some of the ability to prevent attacks. Com-pliance with taking colchicine every day may be ham-pered by its side effects, which include diarrhea , nausea,\nabdominal bloating, and gas. There is a theoretical riskthat colchicine use could damage chromosomes insperms and eggs, or in an embryo during pregnancy, orthat it might reduce fertility. However, studies looking atreproduction in men and women who have usedcolchicine have so far not shown any increased risks.Colchicine is also effective in preventing, delaying, orreversing renal disease associated with amyloidosis.\nOther medications may be used as needed to deal\nwith the pain and fever associated with FMF attacks.Dialysis and/or renal transplant might become necessaryin someone with advanced kidney disease. Given itsgenetic nature, there is no cure for FMF, nor is there likelyto be in the near future. Any couple that has a child diag-nosed with FMF, or anyone with a family history of thecondition (especially those in high-risk ethnic groups),should be offered genetic counseling to obtain the most\nup-to-date information on FMF and testing options.\nPrognosis\nFor those individuals who are diagnosed early\nenough and take colchicine consistently, the prognosis isexcellent. Most will have very few, if any, attacks offever and polyserositis, and will likely not develop seri-ous complications of amyloidosis. The problem of misdi-agnosing FMF continues, but education attempts directedat both the public and medical care providers shouldimprove the situation. Future research should provide abetter understanding of the inflammation process, focus-ing on how neutrophils are genetically regulated. Thatinformation could then be used to develop treatments forFMF with fewer side effects, and might also assist indeveloping therapies for other diseases in which abnor-mal inflammation and immune response are a problem.\nResources\nBOOKS\nKastner, Daniel L. “Intermittent and Periodic Arthritic Syn-\ndromes.” In Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1284Familial Mediterranean feverRheumatology. 13th ed.

    "title": "Familial polyposis",
    "content": "Familial polyposis\nDefinition\nFamilial polyposis is an inherited condition which\nprimarily affects the large intestine (colon and rectum).Large numbers of projecting masses of swollen andthickened or tumorous membrane (polyps) develop onthe inner lining of this part of the bowel. The polypseventually become malignant.\nDescription\nFamilial polyposis (FP) is known by many syn-\nonyms, most include some combination of words whichreflect what is known about the disease. As the disease isinherited, the word, family, is often included. Becausethese mushroom-like growths are the most obvious mani-festation of the disorder, the word, polyp, is usually inthe term as well. Adenoma refers to the particular kind ofpolyp that is typically discovered. Some of the namesfound in medical texts and journals include polyposiscoli, familial colonic polyposis, multiple familial polypo-sis, familial adenomatous colon polyposis, adenomatosisof the colon and rectum (ACR), and familial adenoma-tous polyposis (FAP). The last term and its abbreviationhave been commonly used since the early 1990s. It willbe used in this discussion.\nFamilial polyposis or familial adenomatous poly-\nposis (FAP) is a premalignant disease. This means thata person with FAP, if left untreated, will invariablydevelop cancer . Individuals with this disorder grow\nhundreds of polyps throughout their large intestines.The polyps, which may also be called adenomas, com-monly develop just after puberty . Approximately half\nof all FAP patients will have polyps by age 14. Ninetypercent will have detectable polyps by age 25. Usuallyby age 35–40, one or more of these polyps will becomecancerous.\nFAP is a rare disease. One in 8,000 people in the\nUnited States have FAP. However, it may be very com-mon in affected families. FAP is inherited in an autoso-mal dominant pattern. This means that a person with FAPhas a 50% chance of passing the condition down to eachof their children. FAP can also develop in someone withno family history of the disorder, due to a new geneticmutation in that individual. It is thought that approxi-mately one percent of all colorectal cancers in the UnitedStates can be attributed to FAP.\nCauses and symptoms\nFAP is caused by a portion of a gene that mutates or\nchanges. The original cause of the mutation is unknown.Its exact role in FAP is not completely clear. Researcherstheorize that the normal gene directs the manufacture ofa protein which helps control cell growth. The mutatedgene section in FAP generates an abnormal proteinwhich does not perform its normal function. Cells growout of control, causing the development of multiple,sometimes hundreds, of polyps. One or more of theseeventually becomes cancerous.\nMany individuals develop polyps without display-\ning any symptoms. Others experience such gastrointesti-nal problems as diarrhea ,constipation , abdominal\ncramps, blood in the stool, or weight loss. FAP patientsmay also develop nonmalignant tumors (desmoidtumors), and/or some bone and dental abnormalities. Inaddition, they may exhibit a “spot” on the retina of theeye (congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmentepithelium, or CHRPE).\nRelatives of individuals with diagnosed FAP are at\nhigh risk of having the disease themselves. There are noother known risk factors for this condition.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1285Familial polyposisDiagnosis\nThe abnormal portion of the gene that causes FAP in\nmost patients can be detected. A blood test can then beperformed which identifies family members who have thesame mutation. They will eventually develop the condi-tion. Children who have a parent with FAP, and siblings ofaffected patients whose parental history is incomplete,should be evaluated. The polyps characteristic of FAPhave been found in children as young as age five. Testingof appropriate individuals should take place as soon as thediagnosis of FAP is established in one member of a family.\nRelatives of people with diagnosed FAP should\nexercise caution regarding where they seek advice and\ntesting. One study of a commercially available blood testfound that less than 20% of patients received any genetic\ncounseling , and almost one third of their physicians mis-\ninterpreted the test results.\nRegistries for FAP patients can be found at many\nsites in the United States. Such a registry specializes inidentification, assistance, and education of people with aparticular disease, and is usually a separate department ina research hospital. A team of health professionals whohave expertise in the disorder staff the registry.\nTesting within a research setting and/or at a facility\nwith a registry of patients with FAP is more likely tosafeguard against problems, such as the misunderstand-ing of test results. As part of a research project, some-times counseling as well as blood tests are available at nocharge to the patient. Insurance coverage varies. Con-cerns about confidentiality, and future insurance andemployment discrimination, may prompt individuals topay for the examination out of pocket. Commercial bloodtests cost approximately $250 per sample.\nIf the abnormal gene is found in a family member,\nannual screening for colon polyps is recommended,beginning at age 11. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is used for\nthis examination. It is usually done in a physician’soffice, or in a hospital department, most often by a gas-troenterologist or a surgeon. Food intake may be restrict-ed for 24 hours prior to the procedure. Before the study,the intestine is cleared of stool by one or more small ene-\nmas. Some physicians prefer to sedate the patient, to\nhelp them relax. Then a flexible, lighted, hollow tube(sigmoidoscope) is inserted into the anus and maneu-vered into the large intestine. The physician examines thewall of the colon to look for polyps. If polyps are found,one or more may be removed for biopsy.\nMost patients report little discomfort during the\nexamination. The procedure itself takes five to fifteenminutes. The patient may be at the facility an hour, ormore, if recovery from sedation is needed. If no medica-tion was administered, driving and resumption of normal\nactivities are permitted immediately. The cost of the pro-cedure varies widely, but, as of 1997, it was covered byMedicare, indicating the likelihood of other types ofinsurance coverage.\nIn some cases the portion of the gene responsible for\nFAP cannot be identified. Family members of thesepatients cannot have a predictive blood test. The currentrecommendation is for these patients to have the sameannual examination with flexible sigmoidoscopy aspatients with a diagnosed FAP gene. A noninvasivescreening eye examination to detect CHRPE, associated\nwith FAP, may also be performed.\nTreatment\nThe only definitive treatment for FAP is surgical\nremoval of the lower intestine. Since the goal is to pre-vent cancer, the operation is done as soon as adenoma-tous polyps are found on sigmoidoscopy. Waiting until apolyp becomes malignant is unsafe, as the cancer mayinvade surrounding tissues.\nThere are several choices about the type of surgery to\ntreat this condition. Some authorities advocate removal ofthe colon, leaving the rectum or lowest portion of theintestine in place. The small intestine can be attached tothe rectum, allowing normal bowel function. This is oftencalled ileorectal anastomosis. Others argue that this sec-tion is also liable to develop polyps, needs to be moni-tored regularly, and may require eventual removal.\nExcision of the entire lower intestine with preserva-\ntion of normal bowel function is possible. This entails amore complex surgical procedure. The patient may expe-rience more complications and a longer recovery period.However, the risk of polyp development in this area isvery low. Periodic examination of the intestine may notbe needed once healing is complete.\nThe more intricate surgery may be referred to as a J-\npouch procedure, an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, arestorative proctocolectomy, or an ileoanal reservoir proce-dure. It involves creating a “pouch” of tissue from the smallintestine, which is attached to the anus. This serves as areservoir or holding area for stool, much as the rectum doesnormally. The surgery is often done in several stages. Atemporary ileostomy, which creates an opening of the smallintestines onto the abdomen, is required. When all proce-dures are completed, and after a recuperation period, thepatient regains normal bowel function through the anus.\nSome researchers suggest that as genetic testing\nbecomes more developed, the specific portion of thegene involved may dictate the type of surgery chosen.Those at high risk of developing rectal polyps may be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1286Familial polyposisadvised to have the more complex operation. FAP\npatients felt to be at lower risk for rectal polyps might becounseled to consider the less radical surgery.\nMedical therapy to treat the adenomatous polyps has\nbeen attempted. Some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs have been effective in reducing the number and\nsize of the polyps. It is possible that these agents will beused as an additional treatment for FAP, but they areunlikely to replace surgery.\nIndividuals with FAP are at increased risk for cancers\nof the upper digestive tract including the upper portion ofthe small bowel (dudodenum) and the channels wherebile flows (biliary tract). Cancers of the thyroid, pancreas,and adrenal gland are also more commonly found amongFAP patients. Periodic examination for the developmentof malignancy in these areas is considered part of thetreatment of FAP. In some cases, such as cancer involvingthe duodenum, the tests themselves carry a chance ofcomplications. The risk of the study must be weighedagainst the potential benefits of knowing the results. Non-malignant growths, called desmoid tumors, also occurmore frequently in patients with FAP. Although they arenot malignant, they grow quickly into surrounding tis-sues, causing many difficulties, even death in some cases.\nPrognosis\nThe major cause of death in many patients with FAP\nremains colorectal cancer. One study suggested that evenwith improved disease recognition, social and emotionalfactors, such as fear of surgery, may significantly delay apatient’s treatment. In recent years, the trend is towardsmortality from other causes, such as desmoid tumors orcancers other than colorectal. It has been estimated that apatient with known FAP has a relative risk of dying overthree times greater than that of the average population, ata given age.\nPrevention\nFAP cannot be prevented. Aggressive diagnosis,\ntreatment, and follow-up monitoring are keys to success-ful management of the disease.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nFamilial Polyposis Registry.

Inmany cases the team consists of a man and a woman inorder to treat gender-related issues or serve as role mod-els for family members. Although some forms of familytherapy are based on behavioral or psychodynamic prin-ciples, the most widespread form is based on family sys-tems theory. This approach regards the family, as awhole, as the unit of treatment, and emphasizes such fac-tors as relationships and communication patterns ratherthan traits or symptoms in individual members.\nFamily therapy is a relatively recent development in\npsychotherapy. It began shortly after World War II, whendoctors, who were treating schizophrenic patients,noticed that the patients’ families communicated in dis-turbed ways. The doctors also found that the patients’symptoms rose or fell according to the level of tensionbetween their parents. These observations led to consid-ering a family as an organism or system with its owninternal rules, patterns of functioning, and tendency toresist change. The therapists started to treat the familiesof schizophrenic patients as whole units rather thanfocusing on the hospitalized member. They found that inmany cases the family member with schizophrenia\nimproved when the “patient” was the family system.(This should not be misunderstood to mean that schizo-phrenia is caused by family problems, although familyproblems may worsen the condition.) This approach ofinvolving the entire family in the treatment plan and ther-apy was then applied to families with problems otherthan the presence of schizophrenia.\nFamily therapy is becoming an increasingly com-\nmon form of treatment as changes in American societyare reflected in family structures. It has led to two furtherdevelopments: couples therapy, which treats relationship\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1287Family therapyproblems between marriage partners or gay couples; and\nthe extension of family therapy to religious communitiesor other groups that resemble families.\nPurpose\nFamily therapy is often recommended in the follow-\ning situations:\n• Treatment of a family member with schizophrenia or\nmultiple personality disorder (MPD). Family therapy\nhelps other family members understand their relative’sdisorder and adjust to the psychological changes thatmay be occurring in the relative.\n• Families with problems across generational boundaries.\nThese would include problems caused by parents shar-ing housing with grandparents, or children being rearedby grandparents.\n• Families that deviate from social norms (common-law\nrelationships, gay couples rearing children, etc.). Thesefamilies may not have internal problems but may betroubled by outsiders’ judgmental attitudes.\n• Families with members from a mixture of racial, cultur-\nal, or religious backgrounds.\n• Families who are scapegoating a member or undermin-\ning the treatment of a member in individual therapy.\n• Families where the identified patient’s problems seem\ninextricably tied to problems with other family members.\n• Blended families with adjustment difficulties.\nMost family therapists presuppose an average level\nof intelligence and education on the part of adult mem-bers of the family.\nPrecautions\nSome families are not considered suitable candidates\nfor family therapy. They include:\n• families in which one, or both, of the parents is psy-\nchotic or has been diagnosed with antisocial or para-noid personality disorder,\n• families whose cultural or religious values are opposed\nto, or suspicious of, psychotherapy,\n• families with members who cannot participate in treat-\nment sessions because of physical illness or similarlimitations,\n• families with members with very rigid personality\nstructures, (here, members might be at risk for an emo-tional or psychological crisis),\n• families whose members cannot or will not be able to\nmeet regularly for treatment,\n• families that are unstable or on the verge of breakup.Description\nFamily therapy tends to be short-term treatment, usu-\nally several months in length, with a focus on resolvingspecific problems such as eating disorders, difficultieswith school, or adjustments to bereavement or geographi-cal relocation. It is not normally used for long-term orintensive restructuring of severely dysfunctional families.\nIn family therapy sessions, all members of the family\nand both therapists (if there is more than one) are present atmost sessions. The therapists seek to analyze the process offamily interaction and communication as a whole; they donot take sides with specific members. They may make occa-sional comments or remarks intended to help family mem-bers become more conscious of patterns or structures thathad been previously taken for granted. Family therapists,who work as a team, also model new behaviors for the fami-ly through their interactions with each other during sessions.\nFamily therapy is based on family systems theory,\nwhich understands the family to be a living organism thatis more than the sum of its individual members. Familytherapy uses “systems” theory to evaluate family membersin terms of their position or role within the system as awhole. Problems are treated by changing the way the sys-tem works rather than trying to “fix” a specific member.Family systems theory is based on several major concepts:\nThe identified patient\nThe identified patient (IP) is the family member with\nthe symptom that has brought the family into treatment.The concept of the IP is used by family therapists to keepthe family from scapegoating the IP or using him or heras a way of avoiding problems in the rest of the system.\nHomeostasis (balance)\nThe concept of homeostasis means that the family\nsystem seeks to maintain its customary organization andfunctioning over time. It tends to resist change. The fami-ly therapist can use the concept of homeostasis to explainwhy a certain family symptom has surfaced at a giventime, why a specific member has become the IP, and whatis likely to happen when the family begins to change.\nThe extended family field\nThe extended family field refers to the nuclear fami-\nly, plus the network of grandparents and other membersof the extended family. This concept is used to explainthe intergenerational transmission of attitudes, problems,behaviors, and other issues.\nDifferentiation\nDifferentiation refers to the ability of each family\nmember to maintain his or her own sense of self, while\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1288Family therapyremaining emotionally connected to the family. One\nmark of a healthy family is its capacity to allow membersto differentiate, while family members still feel that theyare “members in good standing” of the family.\nTriangular relationships\nFamily systems theory maintains that emotional rela-\ntionships in families are usually triangular. Whenever anytwo persons in the family system have problems with eachother, they will “triangle in” a third member as a way of sta-bilizing their own relationship. The triangles in a family sys-tem usually interlock in a way that maintains family home-ostasis. Common family triangles include a child and itsparents; two children and one parent; a parent, a child, and agrandparent; three siblings; or, husband, wife, and an in-law.\nPreparation\nIn some instances the family may have been referred\nto a specialist in family therapy by their pediatrician orother primary care provider. It is estimated that as many as50% of office visits to pediatricians have to do with devel-opmental problems in children that are affecting their fam-ilies. Some family doctors use symptom checklists or psy-chological screeners to assess a family’s need for therapy.\nFamily therapists may be either psychiatrists, clinical\npsychologists, or other professionals certified by a spe-cialty board in marriage and family therapy. They willusually evaluate a family for treatment by scheduling aseries of interviews with the members of the immediatefamily, including young children, and significant orsymptomatic members of the extended family. Thisprocess allows the therapist(s) to find out how each mem-ber of the family sees the problem, as well as to form firstimpressions of the family’s functioning. Family therapiststypically look for the level and types of emotionsexpressed, patterns of dominance and submission, theroles played by family members, communication styles,and the locations of emotional triangles. They will alsonote whether these patterns are rigid or relatively flexible.\nPreparation also usually includes drawing a geno-\ngram, which is a diagram that depicts significant personsand events in the family’s history. Genograms alsoinclude annotations about the medical history and majorpersonality traits of each member. Genograms help inuncovering intergenerational patterns of behavior, mar-riage choices, family alliances and conflicts, the exis-tence of family secrets, and other information that shedslight on the family’s present situation.\nRisks\nThe chief risk in family therapy is the possible\nunsettling of rigid personality defenses in individuals, orKEY TERMS\nBlended family —A family formed by the remar-\nriage of a divorced or widowed parent.

Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc-tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal-cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in thebody. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth.\nDescription\nNormally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its\nsalt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the bodyneeds in the blood and putting what the body doesn’tneed into the urine, which leaves the body. This task isperformed in two steps. First, the blood is filteredthrough a kidney structure with small holes that keep thecells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some ofthe small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body,are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream.\nThis reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi’s syn-\ndrome. As a consequence, substances that are normallyreabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins,water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, andphosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic.\nFanconi’s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn-\ndrome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubularsyndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome.Fanconi’s anemia is, however, a totally different disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nFanconi’s syndrome can be caused by a variety of\ngenetic defects and by certain environmental assaults.\nThe genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan-\nconi’s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common causein children), galactosemia , glycogen storage disease,\nhereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome,\nWilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease,\nvitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan-coni’s syndrome.\nEnvironmental assaults that cause Fanconi’s syn-\ndrome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium,lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (likeoutdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances(like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysinetaken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans-\nplantation .\nSymptoms\nFanconi’s syndrome symptoms related directly to\nimpaired absorption include excessive urine productionand urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa-\ntion; anorexia nervosa ; vomiting; elevated levels of glu-\ncose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, andprotein (especially beta\n2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in\nthe urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levelsof phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessivelyacidic blood.\nThe most noticeable indirect consequences of\nimpaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets andosteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associatedwith bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficultywalking. If a person acquires Fanconi’s syndrome as anadult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and isaccompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac-\ntures . Unlike rickets due to malnutrition , these diseases\ncannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness andoccasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of\nthe ineffective reabsorption.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of Fanconi’s syndrome can be made by\nurine and blood tests. It is also important to find theunderlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Othersymptoms specific to a particular patient will point toother useful diagnostic tests. For example, high levels of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1290Fanconi’s syndromeblood galactose in conjunction with symptoms of Fan-\nconi’s syndrome indicate the patient is suffering fromgalactosemia, while high blood levels of cadmium indi-cate the patient is suffering from cadmium poisoning .\nTreatment\nFanconi’s syndrome is best treated by attacking the\nunderlying cause whenever possible. For example, whencystinosis is treated with the drug cysteamine to lowercystine levels in the body or Wilson disease is treatedwith penicillamine to lower the levels of copper, accom-panying symptoms of Fanconi’s syndrome will subside.If the patient has acquired the disease from a heavy metalor another toxic agent, all contact with the toxic agentshould stop; the condition will then likely disappear.\nNevertheless, additional treatment will be necessary\neither when it’s not possible to treat the underlying causeor while waiting for the kidneys to resume normal func-tion. This is done by restricting sodium chloride (tablesalt), giving antacids to counteract the excessive acidity\nof the blood, and supplying potassium supplements.\nKidney transplant is the treatment of last resort, used\nfor patients whose kidneys have failed.\nPrognosis\nFanconi’s syndrome can be reversible. Fanconi’s\nsyndrome caused by kidney transplantation usuallyreverses itself within the first year after transplantsurgery. When caused by a toxin in the environment,Fanconi’s syndrome generally can be reversed by remov-ing the causative agent from the patient’s environment. Ifit is caused by a genetic disease, it can usually bereversed by treating the disease. However, if Fanconi’ssyndrome is not treated or if treatment is unsuccessful,the kidneys can fail.\nPrevention\nFanconi’s syndrome caused secondarily by the\ngenetic diseases galactosemia, glycogen storage disease,hereditary fructose intolerance, and tyrosinemia is pre-vented by appropriate dietary restrictions to treat thegenetic disease, starting in infancy.\nFanconi’s syndrome caused by heavy metals and other\ntoxins can be prevented by avoiding these substances.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBergeron, Michael, André Gougoux, and Patrick Vinay. “The\nRenal Fanconi Syndrome.” In The Metabolic and Molecu-\nlar Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th ed.

    "title": "Fasciotomy",
    "content": "Fasciotomy\nDefinition\nFasciotomy is a surgical procedure that cuts away\nthe fascia to relieve tension or pressure\nPurpose\nThe fascia is thin connective tissue covering, or sep-\narating, the muscles and internal organs of the body. Itvaries in thickness, density, elasticity, and composition,and is different from ligaments and tendons.\nThe fascia can be injured either through constant\nstrain or through trauma. Fasciitis is an inflammation ofthe fascia. The most common condition for which fas-ciotomy is performed is plantar fasciitis, an inflamma-tion of the fascia on the bottom of the foot that is some-times called a heel spur or stone bruise.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1291FasciotomyPlantar fasciitis is caused by long periods on the\nfeet, being overweight, and wearing shoes that do notsupport the foot well. Teachers, mail carriers, runners,and others who make heavy use of their feet are especial-ly likely to suffer from plantar fasciitis.\nPlantar fasciitis results in moderate to disabling heel\npain . If nine to twelve months of conservative treatment\n(reducing time on feet, non-steroid anti-inflammatorydrugs, arch supports) under the supervision of a doctordoes not result in pain relief, a fasciotomy may be done.Fasciotomy removes a small portion of the fascia torelieve tension and pain. Connective tissue grows backinto the cut space left by the cut, effectively lengtheningthe fascia.\nWhen a fasciotomy is performed on other parts of\nthe body, it is usually done to relieve pressure from acompression injury to a limb. This type of injury oftenoccurs during contact sports. The blood vessels of thelimb are damaged. They swell and leak, causinginflammation. Fluid builds up in the area contained bythe fascia. A fasciotomy is done to relieve this pres-sure and prevent tissue death . Similar injury occurs in\nhigh voltage electrical burns where deep tissue dam-\nage occurs.\nPrecautions\nIn the case of injury, fasciotomy is done on an emer-\ngency basis, and the outcome of the surgery dependslargely on the general health of the patient. Plantar fas-ciotomies are appropriate for most people whose footproblems cannot be resolved in any other way.\nDescription\nFasciotomy in the limbs is usually done by a surgeon\nunder general or regional anesthesia. An incision is madein the skin, and a small area of fascia is removed where itwill best relieve pressure. Then the incision is closed.\nPlantar fasciotomy is an endoscopic (performed with\nthe use of an endoscope) procedure. It is done by a footspecialist in a doctor’s office or outpatient surgical clinicunder local anesthesia and takes 20 minutes to one hour.The doctor makes two small incisions on either side ofthe heel. An endoscope is inserted in one to guide thedoctor in where to cut. A tiny knife is inserted in theother. A portion of the fascia is cut from near the heel;then the incisions are closed.\nPreparation\nLittle preparation is done before a fasciotomy. When\nthe fasciotomy is related to burn injuries, the fluid andelectrolyte status of the patient are constantly monitored.KEY TERMS\nEndoscope —A tube that contains a tiny camera and\nlight, that is inserted in the body to allow a doctorto see inside without making a large incision.\nAftercare\nAftercare depends on the reason for the fasciotomy.\nPeople who have endoscopic plantar fasciotomy canwalk without pain almost immediately, return to wearingtheir regular shoes within three to five days, and return tonormal activities within three weeks. Most will need towear arch supports in their shoes.\nRisks\nIn endoscopic plantar fasciotomy, the greatest risk is\nthat the arch will drop slightly as a result of this surgery,causing other foot problems. Risks involved with othertypes of fasciotomy are those associated with the admin-istration of anesthesia and the development of blood clots.\nNormal results\nFasciotomy in the limbs reduces pressure, thus\nreducing tissue death. Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy hasa success rate of 90–95%.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Blast Injuries.” In Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment.\n10th ed. Ed. Lawrence W. Way.

    "title": "Fasting",
    "content": "Fasting\nDefinition\nFasting is voluntarily not eating food for varying\nlengths of time. Fasting is used as a medical therapy formany conditions. It is also a spiritual practice in manyreligions.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1292FastingPurpose\nFasting can be used for nearly every chronic condi-\ntion, including allergies ,anxiety , arthritis, asthma ,\ndepression, diabetes, headaches, heart disease, high cho-\nlesterol , low blood sugar, digestive disorders, mental ill-\nness, and obesity . Fasting is an effective and safe weight\nloss method. It is frequently prescribed as a detoxifica-\ntion treatment for those with conditions that may be\ninfluenced by environmental factors, such as cancer and\nmultiple chemical sensitivity . Fasting has been used\nsuccessfully to help treat people who have been exposedto high levels of toxic materials due to accident or occu-pation. Fasting is thought to be beneficial as a preventa-tive measure to increase overall health, vitality, and resis-tance to disease. Fasting is also used as a method of men-tal and spiritual rejuvenation.\nDescription\nOrigins\nUsed for thousands of years, fasting is one of the\noldest therapies in medicine. Many of the great doctorsof ancient times and many of the oldest healing systemshave recommended it as an integral method of healingand prevention. Hippocrates, the father of Western medi-cine, believed fasting enabled the body to heal itself.Paracelsus, another great healer in the Western tradition,wrote 500 years ago that “fasting is the greatest remedy,the physician within.” Ayurvedic medicine , the world’s\noldest healing system, has long advocated fasting as amajor treatment.\nFasting has also been used in nearly every religion in\nthe world, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism,and Islam. Many of history’s great spiritual leaders fastedfor mental and spiritual clarity, including Jesus, Buddha,and Mohammed. In one of the famous political acts ofthe last century, the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi fast-ed for 21 days to promote peace.\nFasting has been used in Europe as a medical treat-\nment for years. Many spas and treatment centers, particu-larly those in Germany, Sweden, and Russia, use med-ically supervised fasting. Fasting has gained popularityin American alternative medicine over the past severaldecades, and many doctors feel it is beneficial. Fasting isa central therapy in detoxification, a healing methodfounded on the principle that the build up of toxic sub-stances in the body is responsible for many illnesses andconditions.\nThe principle of fasting is simple. When the intake\nof food is temporarily stopped, many systems of thebody are given a break from the hard work of digestion.The extra energy gives the body the chance to heal andrestore itself, and burning stored calories gets rid of toxic\nsubstances stored in the body.\nThe digestive tract is the part of the body most\nexposed to environmental threats, including bacteria,viruses, parasites, and toxins. It requires the mostimmune system support. When food is broken down inthe intestines, it travels through the blood to the liver, thelargest organ of the body’s natural detoxification system.The liver breaks down and removes the toxic by-productsproduced by digestion, including natural ones and thechemicals now present in the food supply. During fast-ing, the liver and immune system are essentially freed todetoxify and heal other parts of the body.\nMany healers claim that fasting is a particularly use-\nful therapy for Americans and for the modern lifestyle,subjected to heavy diets , overeating, and constant expo-\nsure to food additives and chemicals. Some alternativepractitioners have gone so far as to estimate that the aver-age American is carrying 5-10 pounds of toxic sub-stances in their bodies, for which fasting is the quickestand most effective means of removal.\nPhysiology of fasting\nThrough evolution, the body became very efficient\nat storing energy and handling situations when no foodwas available. For many centuries, fasting was probablya normal occurrence for most people, and the bodyadapted to it. It is estimated that even very thin peoplecan survive for 40 days or more without food. The bodyhas a special mechanism that is initiated when no food iseaten. Fasting is not starvation , but rather the body’s\nburning of stored energy. Starvation occurs when thebody no longer has any stored energy and begins usingessential tissues such as organs for an energy source.Therapeutic fasts are stopped long before this happens.\nMany physiological changes occur in the body dur-\ning fasting. During the first day or so, the body uses itsglycogen reserves, the sugars that are the basic energysupply. After these are depleted, the body begins usingfat. However, the brain, which has high fuel require-ments, still needs glucose (sugars converted from glyco-gen). To obtain glucose for the brain, the body begins tobreak down muscle tissue during the second day of thefast. Thus, during fasting some muscle loss will occur. Tofuel the brain, the body would need to burn over a poundof muscle a day, but the body has developed another wayto create energy that saves important muscle mass. Thisprotein-sparing process is called ketosis, which occursduring the third day of a fast for men and the second dayfor women. In this highly efficient state, the liver beginsconverting stored fat and other nonessential tissues intoketones, which can be used by the brain, muscles, and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1293Fastingheart as energy. It is at this point in the fast that sensa-\ntions of hunger generally go away, and many peopleexperience normal or even increased energy levels. Hor-mone levels and certain functions become more stable inthis state as well. The goal of most fasts is to allow thebody to reach the ketosis state in order to burn excess fatand unneeded or damaged tissue. Thus, fasts longer thanthree days are generally recommended as therapy.\nWeight loss occurs most rapidly during the first few\ndays of a fast, up to 2 pounds per day. In following days,the figure drops to around 0.5 pound per day. An averageweight loss of a pound a day for an entire fast can beexpected.\nPerforming a fast\nFasts can be performed for varying lengths of time,\ndepending on the person and his or her health require-ments. For chronic conditions, therapists recommendfrom two to four weeks to get the most benefits. Seven-day fasts are also commonly performed. A popular fast-ing program for prevention and general health is a three-day fast taken four times per year, at the change of eachseason. These can be easily performed over long week-ends. Preventative fasts of one day per week are used bymany people as well.\nJuice fasts are also used by many people, although\nthese are not technically fasts. Juice fasts are less inten-sive than water fasts because the body doesn’t reach theketosis stage. The advantage of juice fasts is that fruit andvegetable drinks can supply extra energy and nutrients.People can fit a few days of juice fasting into their normalschedules without significant drops in energy. Juice fastsare also said to have cleansing and detoxifying effects.The disadvantage of juice fasts is that the body never getsto the ketosis stage, so these fasters are thought to lack thedeep detoxification and healing effects of the water fast.\nMedical supervision is recommended for any fast\nover three days. Most alternative medicine practitioners,such as homeopaths, naturopathic doctors, and ayurvedicdoctors, can supervise and monitor patients during fasts.Those performing extended fasts and those with healthconditions may require blood, urine, and other tests dur-ing fasting. There are many alternative health clinics thatperform medically supervised fasts as well. Some con-ventional medical doctors may also supervise patientsduring fasts. Costs and insurance coverage vary, depend-ing on the doctor, clinic, and requirements of the patient.\nPreparations\nFasts must be entered and exited with care. To enter\na fast, the diet should be gradually lightened over a fewdays. First, heavy foods such as meats and dairy products\nshould be eliminated for a day or two. Grains, nuts, andbeans should then be reduced for several days. The daybefore a fast, only easily digested foods like fruits, lightsalads, and soups should be eaten. During the fast, onlypure water and occasional herbal teas should be drunk.\nFasts should be ended as gradually as they are\nentered, going from lighter to heavier foods progressive-ly. The diet after a fast should emphasize fresh, whole-some foods. Fasters should particularly take care not toovereat when they complete a fast.\nPrecautions\nFasting isn’t appropriate for everyone and, in some\ncases, could be harmful. Any person undertaking a firstfast longer than three days should seek medical supervi-sion. Those with health conditions should always havemedical support during fasting. Plenty of water should betaken by fasters since dehydration can occur. Saunas and\nsweating therapies are sometimes recommended to assistdetoxification, but should be used sparingly. Those fastingshould significantly slow down their lifestyles. Takingtime off of work is helpful, or at least reducing the workload. Fasters should also get plenty of rest. Exercise\nshould be kept light, such as walking and gentle stretching.\nSide effects\nThose fasting may experience side effects of\nfatigue , malaise, aches and pains, emotional duress,\nacne , headaches, allergies, swelling, vomiting, bad\nbreath , and symptoms of colds and flu. These reactions\nare sometimes called healing crises , which are caused by\ntemporarily increased levels of toxins in the body due toelimination and cleansing. Lower energy levels should beexpected during a fast.\nResearch and general acceptance\nThe physiology of fasting has been widely studied\nand documented by medical science. Beneficial effectssuch as lowered cholesterol and improved general func-tioning have been shown. Fasting as a treatment for ill-ness and disease has been studied less, although somestudies around the world have shown beneficial results. A1984 study showed that workers in Taiwan who hadsevere chemical poisoning had dramatic improvement\nafter a ten-day fast. In Russia and Japan, studies havedemonstrated fasting to be an effective treatment for men-tal illness. Fasting has been featured on the cover of med-ical journals, although mainstream medicine has general-ly ignored fasting and detoxification treatments as validmedical procedures.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1294FastingThe majority of research that exists on fasting is tes-\ntimonial, consisting of individual personal accounts ofhealing without statistics or controlled scientific experi-ments. In the alternative medical community, fasting isan essential and widely accepted treatment for many ill-nesses and chronic conditions.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCott, Alan. Fasting: The Ultimate Diet.

Persistentfatigue can cause a lack of mental clarity (or feeling ofmental “fuzziness”), difficulty concentrating, and insome cases, memory loss.\nCauses and symptoms\nFatigue may be the result of one or more environ-\nmental causes such as inadequate rest, improper diet,work and home stressors, or poor physical conditioning,or one symptom of a chronic medical condition or dis-ease process in the body. Heart disease, low blood pres-sure, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, iron-deficiencyanemia, narcolepsy , and cancer can cause long-term,\nongoing fatigue symptoms. Acute illnesses such as viraland bacterial infections can also trigger temporary feel-ings of exhaustion. In addition, mental disorders such asdepression can also cause fatigue.\nA number of medications, including antihistamines ,\nantibiotics , and blood pressure medications, may cause\ndrowsiness as a side-effect. Individuals already sufferingfrom fatigue who are prescribed one of these medicationsmay wish to check with their healthcare provider aboutalternative treatments.\nExtreme fatigue which persists, unabated, for at least\nsix months, is not the result of a diagnosed disease or ill-ness, and is characterized by flu-like symptoms such asswollen lymph nodes, sore throat , and muscle weakness\nand/or pain may indicate a diagnosis of chronic fatigue\nsyndrome . Chronic fatigue syndrome (sometimes called\nchronic fatigue immune deficiency syndrome), is a debil-itating illness that causes overwhelming exhaustion and aconstellation of neurological and immunological symp-toms. Between 1.5 and 2 million Americans are estimat-ed to suffer from the disorder.\nDiagnosis\nBecause fatigue is a symptom of a number of differ-\nent disorders, diseases, and lifestyle choices, diagnosismay be difficult. A thorough examination and patient his-tory by a qualified healthcare provider is the first step indetermining the cause of the fatigue. A physician canrule out physical conditions and diseases that featurefatigue as a symptom, and can also determine if prescrip-tion drugs, poor dietary habits, work environment, orother external stressors could be triggering the exhaus-tion. Several diagnostic tests may also be required to rule\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1295Fatigueout common physical causes of exhaustion, such as\nblood tests to check for iron-deficiency anemia.\nDiagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome is signifi-\ncantly more difficult. Because there is no specific biolog-ical marker or conclusive blood test to check for the dis-order, healthcare providers must rely on the patient’s pre-sentation and severity of symptoms to make a diagnosis.In many cases, individuals with chronic fatigue syn-drome go through a battery of invasive diagnostic testsand several years of consultation with medical profes-sionals before receiving a correct diagnosis.\nTreatment\nConventional medicine recommends the dietary and\nlifestyle changes outlined above as a first line of defenseagainst fatigue. Individuals who experience occasionalfatigue symptoms may benefit from short term use ofcaffeine-containing central nervous stimulants, whichmake people more alert, less drowsy, and improve coor-dination. However, these should be prescribed withextreme caution, as overuse of the drug can lead to seri-ous sleep disorders , like insomnia .\nAnother reason to avoid extended use of caffeine is\nits associated withdrawal symptoms. People who uselarge amounts of caffeine over long periods build up atolerance to it. When that happens, they have to use moreand more caffeine to get the same effects. Heavy caffeineuse can also lead to dependence. If an individual stopsusing caffeine abruptly, withdrawal symptoms mayoccur, including headache , fatigue, drowsiness, yawn-\ning, irritability, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose.These symptoms can go on for as long as a week.\nAlternative treatment\nThe treatment of fatigue depends on its direct cause,\nbut there are several commonly prescribed treatments fornon-specific fatigue, including dietary and lifestylechanges, the use of essential oils and herbal therapies,deep breathing exercises, traditional Chinese medicine ,\nand color therapy.\nDietary changes\nInadequate or inappropriate nutritional intake can\ncause fatigue symptoms. To maintain an adequate energysupply and promote overall physical well-being, individ-uals should eat a balanced diet and observe the followingnutritional guidelines:\n• Drink plenty of water. Individuals should try to drink 9\nto 12 glasses of water a day. Dehydration can reduce\nblood volume, which leads to feelings of fatigue.• Eat iron-rich foods (i.e., liver, raisins, spinach, apri-\ncots). Iron enables the blood to transport oxygenthroughout the tissues, organs, and muscles, and dimin-ished oxygenation of the blood can result in fatigue.\n• Avoid high-fat meals and snacks. High fat foods take\nlonger to digest, reducing blood flow to the brain, heart,and rest of the body while blood flow is increased to thestomach.\n• Eat unrefined carbohydrates and proteins together for\nsustained energy.\n• Balance proteins. Limiting protein to 15–20 grams per\nmeal and two snacks of 15 grams is recommended, butnot getting enough protein adds to fatigue. Pregnant orbreastfeeding women should get more protein.\n• Get the recommended daily allowance of B complex\nvitamins (specifically, pantothenic acid, folic acid , thi-\namine, and vitamin B\n12). Deficiencies in these vitamins\ncan trigger fatigue.\n• Get the recommended daily allowance of selenium,\nriboflavin, and niacin. These are all essential nutritionalelements in metabolizing food energy.\n• Control portions. Individuals should only eat when\nthey’re hungry, and stop when they’re full. An over-stuffed stomach can cause short-term fatigue, and indi-viduals who are overweight are much more likely toregularly experience fatigue symptoms.\nLifestyle changes\nLifestyle factors such as a high-stress job, erratic work\nhours, lack of social or family support, or erratic sleep pat-terns can all cause prolonged fatigue. If stress is an issue, anumber of relaxation therapies and techniques are availableto help alleviate tension, including massage, yoga ,aro-\nmatherapy ,hydrotherapy , progressive relaxation exercis-\nes,meditation , and guided imagery . Some individuals\nmay also benefit from individual or family counseling orpsychotherapy sessions to work through stress-relatedfatigue that is a result of family or social issues.\nMaintaining healthy sleep patterns is critical to prop-\ner rest. Having a set “bedtime” helps to keep sleep onschedule. A calm and restful sleeping environment is alsoimportant to healthy sleep. Above all, the bedroom shouldbe quiet and comfortable, away from loud noises and withadequate window treatments to keep sunlight and street-lights out. Removing distractions from the bedroom suchas televisions and telephones can also be helpful.\nEssential oils\nAromatherapists, hydrotherapists, and other holistic\nhealthcare providers may recommend the use of essential\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1296Fatigueoils of rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ), eucalyptus\nblue gum ( Eucalyptus globulus ), peppermint, ( Mentha x\npiperata ), or scots pine oil ( Pinus sylvestris ) to stimulate\nthe nervous system and reduce fatigue. These oils can beadded to bathwater or massage oil as a topical applica-tion. Citrus oils such as lemon, orange, grapefruit, andlime have a similar effect, and can be added to a steambath or vaporizer for inhalation.\nHerbal remedies\nHerbal remedies that act as circulatory stimulants\ncan offset the symptoms of fatigue in some individuals.An herbalist may recommend an infusion of ginger ( Zin-\ngiber officinale ) root or treatment with cayenne ( Cap-\nsicum annuum ), balmony ( Chelone glabra ), damiana\n(Turnera diffusa ), ginseng ( Panax ginseng ), or rosemary\n(Rosmarinus officinalis ) to treat ongoing fatigue.\nAn infusion is prepared by mixing the herb with\nboiling water, steeping it for several minutes, and thenremoving the herb from the infusion before drinking. Astrainer, tea ball, or infuser can be used to immerse looseherb in the boiling water before steeping and separatingit. A second method of infusion is to mix the loose herbalpreparation with cold water first, bringing the mixture toa boil in a pan or teapot, and then separating the tea fromthe infusion with a strainer before drinking.\nCaffeine-containing central nervous system stimu-\nlants such as tea ( Camellia senensis ) and cola ( Cola niti-\nda) can provide temporary, short-term relief of fatigue\nsymptoms. However, long-term use of caffeine can causerestlessness, irritability, and other unwanted side effects,and in some cases may actually work to increase fatigueafter the stimulating effects of the caffeine wear off. Toavoid these problems, caffeine intake should be limitedto 300 mg or less a day (the equivalent of 4-8 cups ofbrewed, hot tea).\nTraditional Chinese medicine\nChinese medicine regards fatigue as a blockage or\nmisalignment of qi, or energy flow, inside the human\nbody. The practitioner of Chinese medicine choosesacupuncture and/or herbal therapy to rebalance the\nentire system. The Chinese formula Minot Bupleurumsoup (or Xiao Chia Hu Tang) has been used for nearly2,000 years for the type of chronic fatigue that comesafter the flu. In this condition, the person has low-gradefever , nausea, and fatigue. There are other formulas that\nare helpful in other cases. Acupuncture involves theplacement of a series of thin needles into the skin at tar-geted locations on the body known as acupoints in orderto harmonize the energy flow within the human body.KEY TERMS\nAromatherapy —The therapeutic use of plant-\nderived, aromatic essential oils to promote physi-cal and psychological well-being.\nGuided imagery —The use of relaxation and men-\ntal visualization to improve mood and/or physicalwell-being.\nHydrotherapy —Hydrotherapy, or water therapy, is\nuse of water (hot, cold, steam, or ice) to relievediscomfort and promote physical well-being.\nDeep breathing exercises\nIndividuals under stress often experience fast, shal-\nlow breathing. This type of breathing, known as chestbreathing, can lead to shortness of breath , increased\nmuscle tension, inadequate oxygenation of blood, andfatigue. Breathing exercises can both improve respiratoryfunction and relieve stress and fatigue.\nDeep breathing exercises are best performed while\nlaying flat on the back on a hard surface, usually the floor.The knees are bent, and the body (particularly the mouth,nose, and face) is relaxed. One hand should be placed onthe chest and one on the abdomen to monitor breathingtechnique. With proper breathing techniques, the abdomenwill rise further than the chest. The individual takes a seriesof long, deep breaths through the nose, attempting to raisethe abdomen instead of the chest. Air is exhaled throughthe relaxed mouth. Deep breathing can be continued for upto 20 minutes. After the exercise is complete, the individual\nchecks again for body tension and relaxation. Once deepbreathing techniques have been mastered, an individual canuse deep breathing at any time or place as a quick methodof relieving tension and preventing fatigue.\nColor therapy\nColor therapy, also known as chromatherapy, is\nbased on the premise that certain colors are infused withhealing energies. The therapy uses the seven colors of therainbow to promote balance and healing in the mind andbody. Red promotes energy, empowerment, and stimula-tion. Physically, it is thought to improve circulation andstimulate red blood cell production. Red is associatedwith the seventh chakra, located at the root; or base ofspine. In yoga, the chakras are specific spiritual energycenters of the body.\nTherapeutic color can be administered in a number\nof ways. Practitioners of Ayurvedic, or traditional Indian\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1297Fatiguemedicine, wrap their patients in colored cloth chosen for\nits therapeutic hue. Individuals suffering from fatiguewould be wrapped in reds and oranges chosen for theiruplifting and energizing properties. Patients may also bebathed in light from a color filtered light source toenhance the healing effects of the treatment.\nIndividuals may also be treated with color-infused\nwater. This is achieved by placing translucent red coloredpaper or colored plastic wrap over and around a glass ofwater and placing the glass in direct sunlight so the watercan soak up the healing properties and vibrations of thecolor. Environmental color sources may also be used topromote feelings of stimulation and energy. Red wall andwindow treatments, furniture, clothing, and even food maybe recommended for their energizing healing properties.\nColor therapy can be used in conjunction with both\nhydrotherapy and aromatherapy to heighten the thera-peutic effect. Spas and holistic healthcare providers mayrecommend red color baths or soaks, which combine thebenefits of a warm or hot water soak with energizingessential oils and the fatigue-fighting effects of bright redhues used in color therapy.\nPrognosis\nFatigue related to a chronic disease or condition may\nlast indefinitely, but can be alleviated to a degree throughsome of the treatment options outlined here. Exhaustionthat can be linked to environmental stressors is usually eas-ily alleviated when those stressors are dealt with properly.\nThere is no known cure for chronic fatigue syn-\ndrome, but steps can be taken to lessen symptoms andimprove quality of life for these individuals whileresearchers continue to seek a cure.\nPrevention\nMany of the treatments outlined above are also rec-\nommended to prevent the onset of fatigue. Getting ade-quate rest and maintaining a consistent bedtime scheduleare the most effective ways to combat fatigue. A bal-anced diet and moderate exercise program are alsoimportant to maintaining a consistent energy level.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDavis, Martha et al.

    "title": "Fatty liver",
    "content": "Fatty liver\nDefinition\nFatty liver is the collection of excessive amounts of\ntriglycerides and other fats inside liver cells.\nDescription\nAlso called steatosis, fatty liver can be a temporary or\nlong-term condition, which is not harmful itself, but mayindicate some other type of problem. Left untreated, it cancontribute to other illnesses. It is usually reversible oncethe cause of the problem is diagnosed and corrected. Theliver is the organ responsible for changing fats eaten inthe diet to types of fat that can be stored and used by thebody. Triglycerides are one of the forms of fat stored bythe body and used for energy and new cell formation. Thebreak down of fats in the liver can be disrupted by alco-\nholism ,malnutrition ,pregnancy , or poisoning . In fatty\nliver, large droplets of fat, containing mostly triglycerides,collect within cells of the liver. The condition is generallynot painful and may go unnoticed for a long period oftime. In severe cases, the liver can increase to over threetimes its normal size and may be painful and tender.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common cause of fatty liver in the United\nStates is alcoholism. In alcoholic fatty liver, over con-sumption of alcohol changes the way that the liver breaksdown and stores fats. Often, people with chronic alco-holism also suffer from malnutrition by eating irregularlyand not consuming a balanced diet. Conditions that canalso cause fatty liver are other forms of malnutrition(especially when there is not enough protein in the diet),obesity ,diabetes mellitus , and Reye’s syndrome in\nchildren. Pregnancy can cause a rare, but serious form offatty liver that starts late in pregnancy and may be associ-ated with jaundice and liver failure. Some drug overdos-\nes or toxic chemical poisonings, such as carbon tetra-chloride, can also cause fatty liver.\nOften, there are no symptoms associated with fatty\nliver. If there are symptoms, they can include pain under\nthe rib cage on the right side of the body, swelling of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1298Fatty liverabdomen, jaundice, and fever . Symptoms that occur less\noften in alcoholic fatty liver, but more often in pregnancyrelated fatty liver, are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,and abdominal pain.\nDiagnosis\nDuring a physical examination , a doctor might notice\nthat the liver is enlarged and tender when the abdomen ispalpated (examined with the tips of the fingers while thepatient lies flat). Blood tests may be used to determine ifthe liver is functioning properly. A liver biopsy , where a\nsmall sample of liver tissue is removed with a long needleor though a very small incision, can be used to confirmfatty liver. In pregnant women, the fatty liver condition isusually associated with another serious complication, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. In this condition, the mother hasseriously high blood pressure, swelling, and possibly,seizures. Laboratory abnormalities include elevations ofthe SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) andSGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase). In manycases the alkaline phosphatase will be significantly elevat-ed due to cholestasis produced by the fatty infiltration.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves correcting the condition that\ncaused fatty liver and providing supportive care. In fattyliver caused by alcoholism, the treatment is to give updrinking alcohol and to eat a healthy, well balanced diet.In fatty liver associated with pregnancy, the recommend-ed treatment is to deliver the baby, if the pregnancy is farenough along. Vitamin and mineral supplements alongwith nutritional support may be useful.\nPrognosis\nFatty liver is usually reversible if recognized and\ntreated. There may be some long-term tendency towardother types of liver problems depending on how long andhow severe the fatty liver condition was. In pregnantwomen with the condition, the situation can be lifethreatening for both the mother and the infant. Leftuntreated, there is a high risk of death for both the moth-\ner and baby. Severe liver damage that may require a livertransplant can occur in the mother if the condition is notrecognized early.\nPrevention\nPrevention consists of maintaining a well balanced diet\nand healthy lifestyle with moderate or no alcohol consump-tion.

    "title": "Fecal incontinence",
    "content": "Fecal incontinence\nDefinition\nFecal incontinence is the inability to control the pas-\nsage of gas or stools (feces) through the anus. For some\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1299Fecal incontinencepeople fecal incontinence is a relatively minor problem,\nas when it is limited to a slight occasional soiling ofunderwear, but for other people it involves a considerableloss of bowel control and has a devastating effect onquality of life and psychological well-being. Fortunately,professional medical treatment is usually able to restorebowel control or at least substantially reduce the severityof the condition.\nDescription\nFecal incontinence, also called bowel incontinence,\ncan occur at any age, but is most common among peopleover the age of 65, who sometimes have to cope withurinary incontinence as well. It was reported in 1998\nthat about 2% of adults experience fecal incontinence atleast once a week whereas for healthy independent adultsover the age of 65 the figure is about 7%. An extensiveAmerican survey, published in 1993, found fecal soilingin 7.1% of the surveyed population, with gross inconti-nence in 0.7%. For men and women the incidence ofsoiling was the same, but women were almost twice aslikely to suffer from gross incontinence.\nThe wider public health impact of fecal incontinence\nis considerable. In the United States, more than $400million is spent each year on disposable underwear andother incontinence aids. Fecal incontinence is the secondmost common reason for seeking a nursing home place-ment. One-third of the institutionalized elderly sufferfrom this condition. Incontinence sufferers, however,often hesitate to ask their doctors for help because theyare embarrassed or ashamed. The 1993 American surveydiscovered that only one-sixth of those experiencing soil-ing had sought medical advice, and only one-half ofthose afflicted with gross incontinence.\nCauses and symptoms\nFecal incontinence can result from a wide variety of\nmedical conditions, including childbirth-related analinjuries, other causes of damage to the anus or rectum,and nervous system problems.\nVaginal-delivery childbirth is a major cause of fecal\nincontinence. In many cases, childbirth results in damageto the anal sphincter, which is the ring of muscle thatcloses the anus and keeps stools within the rectum until aperson can find an appropriate opportunity to defecate.Nerve injuries during childbirth may also be a factor insome cases. An ultrasound study of first-time mothersfound sphincter injuries in 35%. About one-third of theinjured women developed fecal incontinence or anuncontrollable and powerful urge to defecate (urgency)within six weeks of giving birth. Childbirth-relatedincontinence is usually restricted to gas, but for some\nwomen involves the passing of liquid or solid stools.\nThe removal of hemorrhoids by surgery or other\ntechniques (hemorrhoidectomies) can also cause analdamage and fecal incontinence, as can more complexoperations affecting the anus and surrounding areas. Analand rectal infections as well as Crohn’s disease can lead\nto incontinence by damaging the muscles that controldefecation. For some people, incontinence becomes aproblem when the anal muscles begin to weaken inmidlife or old age.\nDementia ,mental retardation , strokes, brain tumors,\nmultiple sclerosis , and other conditions that affect the ner-\nvous system can cause fecal incontinence by interferingwith muscle function or the normal rectal sensations that\ntrigger sphincter c ontraction and are necessary for\nbowel control. One study of multiple sclerosis patientsdiscovered that about half were incontinent. Nervedamage caused by long-lasting diabetes mellitus (dia-\nbetic neuropathy ) is another condition that can give\nrise to incontinence.\nDiagnosis\nMedical assessments in cases of fecal incontinence\ntypically involve three steps: asking questions about thepatient’s past and current health (the medical history); aphysical examination of the anal region; and testing for\nobjective information regarding anal and rectal function.\nPatient history\nThe medical history relies on questions that allow\nthe doctor to evaluate the nature and severity of theproblem and its effect on the patient’s life. The doctorasks, for instance, how long the patient has been suf-fering from incontinence; how often and under whatcircumstances incontinence occurs; whether the patienthas any control over defecation; and whether thepatient has obstacles to defecation in his or her every-day surroundings, such as a toilet that can be reachedonly by climbing a long flight of stairs. For womenwho have given birth, a detailed obstetric history isalso necessary.\nPhysical examination\nThe physical examination begins with a visual\ninspection of the anus and the area lying between theanus and the genitals (the perineum) for hemorrhoids,infections, and other conditions that might explain thepatient’s difficulties. During this phase of the examina-tion the doctor asks the patient to bear down. Bearingdown enables the doctor to check whether rectal pro-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1300Fecal incontinencelapse or certain other problems exist. Rectal prolapse\nmeans that the patient’s rectum has been weakened anddrops down through the anus. Next, the doctor uses a pinor probe to stroke the perianal skin. Normally this touch-\ning causes the anal sphincter to contract and the anus topucker; if it does not, nerve damage may be present. Thefinal phase of the examination requires the doctor toexamine internal structures by carefully inserting agloved and lubricated finger into the anal canal. Thisallows the doctor to judge the strength of the anal sphinc-ter and a key muscle (the puborectalis muscle) in main-taining continence; to look for abnormalities such asscars and rectal masses; and to learn many other thingsabout the patient’s medical situation. At this point thedoctor performs the anal wink test again and asks thepatient to squeeze and bear down.\nLaboratory tests\nInformation from the medical history and physical\nexamination usually needs to be supplemented by teststhat provide objective measurements of anal and rectalfunction. Anorectal manometry, a common procedure,involves inserting a small tube (catheter) or balloondevice into the anal canal or rectum. Manometry mea-sures, among other things, pressure levels in the analcanal, rectal sensation, and anal and rectal reflexes. Testsare also available for assessing nerve damage. An analultrasound probe can supply accurate images of the analsphincter and reveal whether injury has occurred. Mag-\nnetic resonance imaging , which requires the insertion of\na coil into the anal canal, is useful at times.\nTreatment\nFecal incontinence arising from an underlying con-\ndition such as diabetic neuropathy can sometimes behelped by treating the underlying condition. When thatdoes not work, or no underlying condition can be discov-ered, one approach is to have the patient use a supposito-ry or enema to stimulate defecation at the same timeevery day or every other day. The goal is to restore regu-lar bowel habits and keep the bowels free of stools. Med-ications such as loperamide (Imodium) and codeinephosphate are often effective in halting incontinence, butonly in less severe cases involving liquid stools orurgency. Dietary changes and exercises done at home tostrengthen the anal muscles may also help.\nGood results have been reported for biofeedback\ntraining, although the subject has not been properlyresearched. In successful cases, patients regain completecontrol over defecation, or at least improve their control,by learning to contract the external part of the analsphincter whenever stools enter the rectum.

Biofeedback training begins\nwith the insertion into the rectum of a balloon manome-try device hooked up to a pressure monitor. The presenceof stools in the rectum is simulated by inflating the bal-loon, which causes pressure changes that are recorded onthe monitor. The monitor also records sphincter contrac-tion. By watching the monitor and following instructionsfrom the equipment operator, the patient gradually learnsto contract the sphincter automatically in response tofullness in the rectum. Sometimes one training session isenough, but often several are needed. Biofeedback is notan appropriate treatment in all cases, however. It is usedonly with patients who are highly motivated; who areable, to some extent, to sense the presence of stools in therectum; and who have not lost all ability to contract theexternal anal sphincter. One specialist suggests that pos-sibly two-thirds of incontinence sufferers are candidatesfor biofeedback.\nSome people may require surgery.

    "title": "Fecal occult blood test",
    "content": "Fecal occult blood test\nDefinition\nThe fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is performed as\npart of the routine physical examination during theexamination of the rectum. It is used to detect micro-\nscopic blood in the stool and is a screening tool for col-orectal cancer .\nPurpose\nFOBT uses chemical indicators on stool samples to\ndetect the presence of blood not otherwise visible. (Theword “occult” in the test’s name means that the blood ishidden from view.) Blood originating from or passingthrough the gastrointestinal tract can signal many condi-tions requiring further diagnostic procedures and, possi-bly, medical intervention. These conditions may bebenign or malignant and some of them include:\n• colorectal and gastric cancers\n• ulcers\n• hemorrhoids\n• polyps\n• inflammatory bowel disease\n• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused\nby medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-\ntory drugs , also called NSAIDs)\n• irritations or lesions of the gastrointestinal tract caused\nby stomach acid disorders, such as reflux esophagitis\nThe FOBT is used routinely (in conjunction with a\nrectal examination performed by a physician) to screen\nfor colorectal cancer, particularly after age 50. The order-ing of this test should not be taken as an indication thatcancer is suspected. The FOBT must be combined withregular screening endoscopy (such as a sigmoidoscopy )\nto detect cancers at an early stage.\nPrecautions\nCertain foods and medicines can influence the test\nresults. Some fruits contain chemicals that prevent theguaiac, the chemical in which the test paper is soaked,from reacting with the blood. Aspirin and some NSAIDs\nirritate the stomach, resulting in bleeding and should beavoided prior to the examination, along with red meatand many vegetables and fruits containing vitamin C. Allof these factors could result in a false-positive test.\nDescription\nFeces for the stool samples is obtained either by the\nphysician at the rectal examination or by the patient athome, using a small spatula or a collection device. Inmost cases, the collection of stool samples can easily bedone at home, using a kit supplied by the physician. Thestandard kit contains a specially prepared card on which\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1302Fecal occult blood testa small sample of stool will be spread, using a stick pro-\nvided in the kit. The sample is placed in a special enve-lope and either mailed or brought in for analysis. Whenthe physician applies hydrogen peroxide to the back ofthe sample, the paper will turn blue if an abnormalamount of blood is present.\nTypes of fecal occult blood tests\nHemoccult is one type of fecal occult blood test, and\nit is the most commonly used. The Hemoccult test takesless than five minutes to perform and may be performedin the physician’s office or in the laboratory. The Hemoc-cult blood test can detect bleeding from the colon as lowas 0.5 mg per day.\nTests that use anti-hemoglobin antibodies (or\nimmunochemical tests) to detect blood in the stool arealso used. Immunochemical tests can detect up to 0.7 mgof hemoglobin in the stool and do not require dietaryrestrictions. Immunochemical tests\n• are not accurate for screening for stomach cancer\n• are more sensitive than Hemoccult tests in detecting\ncolorectal cancer\n• are more expensive than Hemoccult tests\nHemoquant, another fecal occult blood test, is used\nto detect as much as 500 mg/g of blood in the stool. Likethe Hemoccult, the Hemoquant test is affected by redmeat. It is not affected by chemicals in vegetables.\nFecal blood may also be measured by measuring the\nchromium in the red blood cells in the feces. The stool iscollected for three to ten days. The test is used in caseswhere the exact amount of the blood loss is required andit is the only test that can exclude blood loss from thegastrointestines with accuracy.\nPreparation\nFor 72 hours prior to collecting samples, patients\nshould avoid red meats, NSAIDs (including aspirin),antacids , steroids, iron supplements, and vitamin C,\nincluding citrus fruits and other foods containing largeamounts of vitamin C. Foods like uncooked broccoli,uncooked turnips, cauliflower, uncooked cantaloupe,uncooked radish and horseradish and parsnips should beavoided and not eaten during the 72 hours prior to theexamination. Fish, chicken, pork, fruits (other than mel-ons) and many cooked vegetables are permitted in the diet.\nResults\nMany factors can result in false-positive and false-\nnegative findings.KEY TERMS\nOccult —Not visible or easily detected.\nPositive results\nIt is important to note that a true-positive finding\nonly signifies the presence of blood—it is not an indica-tion of cancer. The National Cancer Institute states that,in its experience, less than 10% of all positive resultswere caused by cancer. The FOBT is positive in 1–5% ofthe unscreened population and 2–10% of those are foundto have cancer. The physician will want to follow up on apositive result with further tests, as indicated by otherfactors in the patient’s history or condition.\nNegative results\nAlternatively, a negative result (meaning no blood\nwas detected) does not guarantee the absence of colon\ncancer , which may bleed only occasionally or not at all.\n(Only 50% of colon cancers are FOBT-positive.)\nConclusions\nScreening using the FOBT has been demonstrated to\nreduce colorectal cancer. However, because only half ofcolorectal cancers are FOBT-positive, FOBT must becombined with regular screening endoscopy to increasethe detection of pre-malignant colorectal polyps and can-cers. Since, through FOBT, cancer may be detected early,the benefits of possible early detection must be consid-ered along with the likelihood of complications and costsfor additional studies.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDeVita, Vincent, Samuel Hellman, and Steven Rosenburg.\nCancer:Principles and Practices of Oncology.

    "title": "Feldenkrais method",
    "content": "Feldenkrais method\nDefinition\nThe Feldenkrais method is an educational system\nthat allows the body to move and function more effi-ciently and comfortably. Its goal is to re-educate thenervous system and improve motor ability. The systemcan accomplish much more, relieving pressure on jointsand weak points, and allowing the body to heal repeti-tive strain injuries. Continued use of the method canrelieve pain and lead to higher standards of achieve-\nment in sports, the martial arts, dancing and other phys-ical disciplines.\nPupils are taught to become aware of their move-\nments and to become aware of how they use their bodies,thus discovering possible areas of stress and strain. The\ngoal of Feldenkrais is to take the individual from merelyfunctioning, to functioning well, free of pain and restric-tion of movement. Feldenkrais himself stated that hisgoal was, “To make the impossible possible, the possibleeasy, and the easy, elegant.”\nPurpose\nThis method of re-educating the nervous system\ncan be beneficial to a wide range of people, includingathletes, children, the elderly, martial artists, those whoare handicapped, people with special needs, and thosesuffering from degenerative diseases. It has alsoproved popular with artists, particularly musicians, anumber of whom have used Feldenkrais to improvetheir performance.\nThe Feldenkrais Guild of North America (FGNA)\nstates that over half of the those who turn to Feldenkraispractitioners are seeking relief from pain. Many peoplewho have pain from an injury compensate by changingtheir movements to limit pain. Often these changedmovements remain after the pain from the originalinjury is gone, and new pain may occur. Feldenkraishelps students become aware of the changed movementsand allows them to learn new movements that relievetheir pain. Apart from the obvious physical benefits ofmore efficient movement and freedom from pain andrestriction, Feldenkrais practitioners assert that there areother positive benefits for overall physical and mentalhealth. Feldenkrais can result in increased awareness,flexibility, and coordination, and better relaxation.Feldenkrais practitioners have also noted other benefitsin their students, including improvements in awareness,flexibility, coordination, breathing, digestion, sleep,mood, mental alertness, energy, and range of motion, aswell as reduced stress and hypertension , and fewer\nheadaches and backaches.\nMusicians and athletes can improve their perfor-\nmance in many ways when they learn to use their bodiesmore efficiently. Feldenkrais can also help injured ath-letes regain lost potential and free them from pain andrestriction of movement.\nThere are numerous accounts of the remarkable\nresults obtained when Feldenkrais is taught to handi-capped children so that they can learn to function despitetheir limitations. Handicapped people can learn to makefull use of whatever potential they have, and to havemore confidence in their abilities. Practitioners who spe-cialize in teaching Feldenkrais to those who have handi-caps have in many cases allowed the patient to discoverways of performing tasks which were previously thoughtto be impossible for them.\nThe elderly, whose movements are often restricted\nby pain and stiffness, can learn to overcome these obsta-cles with Feldenkrais instruction. In some instances evensevere cases of arthritis have been conquered. Theoreti-cally, Feldenkrais can make possible renewed levels ofenergy and freedom from restriction.\nDescription\nOrigins\nMoshe Feldenkrais (1904–1984) was a Russian-\nborn Israeli physicist and engineer who was also anactive soccer player and judo master. He devised hissystem in response to his own recurring knee injury,which had restricted his movement and caused himgreat pain over a long period of time. Feldenkraisbelieved that repeated muscle patterns cause the partsof the brain controlling those muscles to stay in a fixedpattern as well. He thought that the more the musclesare used, the more parts of the brain can be activated.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1304Feldenkrais methodHe devised a method of re-educating the neuromuscular\nsystem and re-evaluating movement to increase effi-ciency and reduce stress, using his knowledge ofmechanics and engineering, and applying some of hismartial arts training.\nFeldenkrais is described a being a dual system, with\ntwo components: “Awareness Through Movement” and“Functional Integration.” The system aims to re-educatethe body so that habitual movements that cause strain orpain can be relearned to improve efficiency and eliminatedangerous or painful action.\nFeldenkrais helps to translate intention into action.\nIn practice, an individual can learn to achieve his or herhighest potential, while at the same time learning toavoid and eliminate stresses, strains, and the possibilityof injury.\nFunctional integration\nDuring this session, the patient wears comfortable\nclothing, and may sit, stand, walk, or lie on a lowpadded table. The practitioner helps the pupil by guid-ing him or her through a number of movements. Thepractitioner may use touch to communicate with thestudent, but touch is not used to correct any move-ments. The purpose of this session is to increase a stu-dent’s awareness of his or her own movement andbecome open to different possibilities for movement.The instruction can be focused on a particular activitythat the student does every day, or that causes him orher pain. The student can learn to alter habitual move-ments and re-educate the neuromuscular system. Thistype of session is particularly useful for those whosuffer from limitations originating from misuse,stress, illness, or accident. It can also help athletes andmusicians perform to the best of their ability byincreasing their possibilities for movement. It offersstudents the potential for improving their physical andmental performance in addition to heightening thesense of well-being.\nAwareness through movement\nFeldenkrais’s martial arts background can be clear-\nly identified in many of the aspects of AwarenessThrough Movement (ATM). During group sessions,pupils are taught to become acutely aware of all theirmovements and to imagine them, so that they canimprove the efficiency of their actions in their minds,and put them into practice. Pupils are encouraged to bedisciplined about practicing their exercises, to achievemaximum benefit.\nAwareness through movement is described as an\nexploratory, nonjudgmental process through which pupilsMOSHE FELDENKRAIS\n(1904–1984)\nMoshe Feldenkrais was born on the border\nbetween Russia and Poland. When he was only a boy of13, he traveled to Palestine on foot. The journey took ayear, and once there, young Feldenkrais worked as alaborer and cartographer, also tutoring others in mathe-matics. Moving to France in 1933, he graduated inmechanical and electrical engineering from the Ecoledes Travaux Publiques de Paris.\nFeldendrais became the first person to open a Judo\ncenter in Paris after meeting with Jigaro Kano. He wasalso one of the first Europeans to become a black belt inJudo, in 1936.\nObtaining his Ph.D. at the Sorbonne, he went on to\nassist Nobel Prize laureate, Frédéric Joliot-Curie at theCurie Institute. During World War II in England, heworked on the new sonar anti-submarine research.\nPrompted by a recurring leg injury, he applied his\nknowledge of the martial arts and his training as anengineer to devise a method of re-integrating the body.The concept was that more efficient movement wouldallow for the treatment of pain or disability, and the bet-ter-functioning of the body as a whole. Later on, hewould begin to teach what he had learned to others inTel Aviv.\nIn addition to many books about judo, including\nHigher Judo , he wrote six books on his method.\nPatricia Skinner\nare encouraged to observe and learn about themselves and\ntheir movements. The range of this therapy is wide, andthere are thousands of different lessons designed to helpspecific areas.\nPreparations\nNo preparation is necessary for the practice of\nFeldenkrais, and all are encouraged to seek help fromthis system. No condition is considered a preclusion tothe benefits of Feldenkrais.\nPrecautions\nAs with any therapy or treatment, care should be\ntaken to choose a qualified practitioner. Feldenkrais prac-titioners stress that the body must not be forced to doanything, and if any movement is painful, or evenuncomfortable, it should be discontinued immediatelyand the patient should seek professional help.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1305Feldenkrais methodSide effects\nNo known side effects are associated with the prac-\ntice of Feldenkrais.\nResearch and general acceptance\nSince Moshe Feldenkrais began to teach his method,\nit has gradually gained acceptance as an education sys-tem.

    "title": "Female genital mutilation",
    "content": "Female genital mutilation\nDefinition\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) is the cutting, or\npartial or total removal, of the external female genitaliafor cultural, religious, or other non-medical reasons. It isusually performed on girls between the ages of four and10. It is also called female circumcision .\nPurpose\nFGM results in the cutting or removal of the tissues\naround the vagina that give women pleasurable sexualfeelings. This procedure is used for social and culturalcontrol of women’s sexuality. In its most extreme form,infibulation, where the girl’s vagina is sewn shut, the pro-cedure ensures virginity. In some cultures where femalecircumcision has been a tradition for hundreds of years,this procedure is considered a rite of passage for younggirls. Families fear that if their daughters are left uncir-cumcised, they may not be marriageable. As in most cul-tures, there is also the fear that the girl might bringshame to the family by being sexually active and becom-ing pregnant before marriage.\nPrecautions\nIt is illegal to perform FGM in many countries,\nincluding the United States, Canada, France, GreatBritain, Sweden, Switzerland, Egypt, Kenya, and Sene-gal. This procedure is usually done in the home or some-where other than a medical setting. Often, it is performedby a family member or by a local “circumciser,” usingknives, razor blades, or other tools that may not be steril-ized before use.\nDescription\nFemale circumcision includes a wide range of pro-\ncedures. The simplest form involves a small cut to theclitoris or labial tissue. A Sunna circumcision removesthe prepuce (a fold of skin that covers the clitoris) and/orthe tip of the clitoris. A clitoridectomy removes the entireclitoris and some or all of the surrounding tissue; thisprocedure occurs in approximately 80% of cases. Themost extreme form of genital mutilation is excision andinfibulation, in which the clitoris and all of the surroundtissue are cut away and the remaining skin is sewntogether. Only a small opening is left for the passage of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1306Female genital mutilationurine and menstrual blood. Infibulation accounts for\napproximately 15% of FGM procedures.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates\nthat between 100 million and 140 million girls andwomen have undergone some form of FGM. As a verydeeply rooted cultural and religious tradition still prac-ticed in over 28 African and Asian countries, up to twomillion girls per year are at risk. The following countrieshave the highest number of occurrences of FGM: Dji-bouti (98%), Egypt (97%), Eritrea (95%), Guinea (99%),Mali (94%), Sierra Leone (90%), and Somalia (98-100%). As more people move to Western countries fromcountries where female circumcision is performed, thepractice has come to the attention of health professionalsin the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia.\nIn an effort to integrate old customs with modern\nmedical care, some immigrant families have requestedthat physicians perform the procedure. While trying tobe sensitive to cultural traditions, health careproviders are sometimes put in the difficult position ofchoosing to perform this procedure in a medical facili-ty under sanitary conditions, or refusing the request,knowing that it may be done anyway with no medicalsupervision. Some families who are intent on havingthis procedure done will take their daughters back tothe country they immigrated from in order to have thegirls circumcised.\nMany national and international medical organiza-\ntions including the American Medical Association(AMA), Canadian medical organizations, and WHOoppose the practice of female genital mutilation. TheUnited Nations (UN) considers female genital mutilationa violation of human rights. WHO has undertaken a num-ber of projects aimed at decreasing the incidence ofFGM. These include the following activities:\n• publishing a statement addressing the regional status of\nFGM and encouraging the development of national pol-icy against its practice,\n• organizing training for regional community workers,\n• developing educational materials for local health care\nworkers,\n• providing alternative occupations for individuals who\nperform FGM procedures.\nAftercare\nA girl or young woman who has recently had the\nprocedure performed may require supportive care to con-trol bleeding and antibiotics to prevent infection.\nWomen who were circumcised as children may requiremedical care to treat complications. Pregnant womenKEY TERMS\nCircumcision —A procedure, usually with reli-\ngious or cultural significance, where the prepuceor skin covering the tip of the penis on a boy, orthe clitoris on a girl, is cut away.\nClitoridectomy —A procedure where the clitoris\nand possibly some of the surrounding labial tissueat the opening of the vagina is cut away.\nInfibulation —A procedure where the tissue around\nthe vagina is sewn shut, leaving only a small open-ing for the passage of urine and menstrual blood.\nwho have been infibulated may have to have the labial\ntissue cut open to allow the baby to be delivered. After-care should be provided with a supportive and nonjudg-mental approach towards the girls and women who haveundergone this procedure.\nRisks\nThe immediate risks after the procedure are hemor-\nrhage (excessive bleeding), severe pain , and infection\n(including abscesses, tetanus , and gangrene ). The most\nsevere consequence is death due to excessive blood loss.\nLong term complications include scarring, interferencewith the drainage of urine and menstrual blood, chronicurinary tract infections, pelvic and back pain, and infer-\ntility . Sexual intercourse can be painful. Complications\nof childbirth are also a risk. It is unclear whether it is\nrelated to the procedure itself, or related to the generalcondition of medical practice, but infant and maternaldeath rates are generally higher in those communitieswhere female circumcision is practiced.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nEyega, Z., and E.

    "title": "Female sexual arousal disorder",
    "content": "Female sexual arousal disorder\nDefinition\nFemale sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) occurs when\na woman is continually unable to attain or maintainarousal and lubrication during intercourse, is unable toreach orgasm, or has no desire for sexual intercourse.\nDescription\nThe disorder typically affects up to 25 percent of all\nAmerican women, or an estimated 47 million women.Three-fourths of women with FSAD are postmenopausal.Women describe it as being “unable to get turned on,” orbeing continually disinterested in sex. It is also called“frigidity.” Other terms for the disorder include dyspareu-nia and vaginismus, both of which involve pain during\nintercourse.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are numerous causes of this disorder. They\ninclude:\n• physical problems, such as endometriosis ,cystitis ,o r\nvaginitis\n• systemic problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure,\nor hypothyroidism . Even pregnancy or the postpartum\nperiod (time after delivery of a child) may affect desire.Menopause is also known to reduce sexual desire.\n• medications, including oral contraceptives , anti-\ndepressants, antihypertensives, and tranquilizers\n• surgery, such as mastectomy or hysterectomy which\nmay affect how a woman feels about her sexual self.\n• stress\n• depression\n• use of alcohol, drugs, or cigarette smoking\nSymptoms vary. A woman may have no desire for\nsex, or may not be able to maintain arousal, or may beunable to reach orgasm. She may also have pain duringsex or orgasm, which interferes with her desire for inter-course.\nDiagnosis\nTo make a diagnosis, a woman’s physician - either\nfamily doctor, gynecologist, or even urologist — takes acomplete medical history to determine when the problemstarted, how it presents, how severe it is, and what thepatient thinks may be causing it. The doctor will alsoconduct a complete physical examination , looking for\nany abnormalities in the genital region\nTreatment\nThe physician should start by providing education\nabout the disorder and recommending various non-med-ical treatment strategies. These include:\n• use of erotic materials, such as vibrators, books, maga-\nzines and videos\n• sensual massage, avoiding the genitals\n• position changes to reduce pain\n• use of lubricants to moisten the vagina and genital area\n• kegel exercises to strengthen the vagina and clitoris\n• therapy to overcome any relationship or sexual abuse\nissues\nMedical treatments include:\n• estrogen replacement therapy, which may help with\nvaginal dryness, pain and arousal\n• testosterone therapy in women who have low levels of\nthis male hormone (side effects, however, may includedeepening voice, hair growth, and acne)\n• the EROS clitoral therapy device (EROS-CTD), recent-\nly approved by the Food and Drug Administration; asmall vacuum pump, placed over the clitoris and gentlyactivated to provide a gentle suction designed toincrease blood flow to the region, which, in turn, helpswith arousal\n• using the herb yohimbine combined with nitric oxide\nhas been found to increase vaginal blood flow in post-menopausal women and thus help with some forms ofFSAD\nAlternative treatment\nNatural estrogens, such as those found in soy prod-\nucts and flax, may be effective. Herbal remedies includebelladonna, gingko, and motherwort. However, there isno scientific evidence to prove these herbs actually help.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1308Female sexual arousal disorderSome women squirt vitamin E in their vagina to increase\nlubrication.\nWomen may also want to see a sexual therapist for\nadditional help.\nPrognosis\nGenerally, once women seek the appropriate help\nthey are quite likely to find a way to resolve their prob-lems. Often, a holistic approach, using physical as wellas emotional therapies, is required for success.\nPrevention\nMaintaining a close and open relationship with a\npartner is one way to avoid the emotional pain and isola-tion that can lead to sexual dysfunction . Additionally,\nwomen should learn if any medications they take affectsexual function, and should refrain from alcohol anddrugs and quit smoking. Women who have anxieties andfears about sexual intercourse, whether because of earlierabuse, rape, or a prudish upbringing, should deal withthose issues through therapy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerman M.D., Jennifer, and Laura Berman, Phd.

    "title": "Fetal alcohol syndrome",
    "content": "Fetal alcohol syndrome\nDefinition\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a pattern of birth\ndefects , learning, and behavioral problems affecting\nindividuals whose mothers consumed alcohol duringpregnancy .\nDescription\nFAS is the most common preventable cause of men-\ntal retardation . This condition was first recognized and\nreported in the medical literature in 1968 in France and in1973 in the United States. Alcohol is a teratogen, the termused for any drug, chemical, maternal disease or otherenvironmental exposure that can cause birth defects orfunctional impairment in a developing fetus. Some fea-tures may be present at birth including low birth weight,prematurity , and microcephaly. Characteristic facial fea-\ntures may be present at birth, or may become more obvi-ous over time. Signs of brain damage include delays indevelopment, behavioral abnormalities, and mental retar-dation, but affected individuals exhibit a wide range ofabilities and disabilities. It has only been since 1991 thatthe long-term outcome of FAS has been known. Learning,behavioral, and emotional problems are common in ado-lescents and adults with FAS. Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE),a term no longer favored, is sometimes used to describeindividuals with some, but not all, of the features of FAS.In 1996, the Institute of Medicine suggested a five-levelsystem to describe the birth defects, learning and behav-ioral difficulties in offspring of women who drank alcoholduring pregnancy. This system contains criteria includingconfirmation of maternal alcohol exposure, characteristicfacial features, growth problems, learning and behavioralproblems, and birth defects known to be associated withprenatal alcohol exposure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1309Fetal alcohol syndromeThe incidence of FAS varies among different popu-\nlations studied, and ranges from approximately one in200 to one in 2000 at birth. However, a recent studyreported in 1997, utilizing the Institute of Medicine crite-ria, estimated the prevalence in Seattle, Washington from1975–1981 at nearly one in 100 live births. Avoidingalcohol during pregnancy, including the earliest weeks ofthe pregnancy can prevent FAS. There is no amount ofalcohol use during pregnancy that has been proven to becompletely safe.\nThere is no racial or ethnic predilection for FAS.\nIndividuals from different genetic backgrounds exposedto similar amounts of alcohol during pregnancy mayexhibit different signs or symptoms of FAS. Several stud-ies have estimated that between 25–45% of chronic alco-holic women will give birth to a child with FAS if theycontinue to drink during pregnancy. The risk of FASappears to increase as a chronic alcoholic woman pro-gresses in her childbearing years and continues to drink.That is, a child with FAS will often be one of the lastborn to a chronic alcoholic woman, although older sib-lings may exhibit milder features of FAS. Binge drink-ing, defined as sporadic use of five or more standardalcoholic drinks per occasion, and “moderate” dailydrinking (two to four 12 oz bottles of beer, eight to 16ounces of wine, two to four ounces of liquor) can alsoresult in offspring with features of FAS.\nCauses and symptoms\nFAS is not a genetic or inherited disorder. It is a pat-\ntern of birth defects, learning, and behavioral problemsthat are the result of maternal alcohol use during thepregnancy. The alcohol freely crosses the placenta andcauses damage to the developing embryo or fetus. Alco-hol use by the father cannot cause FAS. If a woman whohas FAS drinks alcohol during pregnancy, then she mayalso have a child with FAS. Not all individuals fromalcohol exposed pregnancies have obvious signs orsymptoms of FAS; individuals of different genetic back-grounds may be more or less susceptible to the damagethat alcohol can cause. The dose of alcohol, the time dur-ing pregnancy that alcohol is used, and the pattern ofalcohol use all contribute to the different signs and symp-toms that are found.\nClassic features of FAS include short stature, low\nbirthweight and poor weight gain, microcephaly, and acharacteristic pattern of facial features. These facial fea-tures in infants and children may include small eye open-ings (measured from inner corner to outer corner), epican-thal folds (folds of tissue at the inner corner of the eye),small or short nose, low or flat nasal bridge, smooth orpoorly developed philtrum (the area of the upper lip abovethe colored part of the lip and below the nose), thin upper\nlip, and small chin. Some of these features are nonspecific,meaning they can occur in other conditions, or be appro-priate for age, racial, or family background. Other majorand minor birth defects that have been reported includecleft palate, congenital heart defects, strabismus ,hearing\nloss, defects of the spine and joints, alteration of the hand\ncreases, small fingernails, and toenails. Since FAS wasfirst described in infants and children, the diagnosis issometimes more difficult to recognize in older adolescentsand adults. Short stature and microcephaly remain com-mon features, but weight may normalize, and the individ-ual may actually become overweight for his/her height.The chin and nose grow proportionately more than themiddle part of the face and dental crowding may become aproblem. The small eye openings and the appearance ofthe upper lip and philtrum may continue to be characteris-tic. Pubertal changes typically occur at the normal time.\nNewborns with FAS may have difficulties with feed-\ning due to a poor suck, have irregular sleep-wake cycles,decreased or increased muscle tone, seizures or tremors .\nDelays in achieving developmental milestones such asrolling over, crawling, walking and talking may becomeapparent in infancy. Behavior and learning difficulties typ-ical in the preschool or early school years include poorattention span, hyperactivity, poor motor skills, and slowlanguage development. Attention deficit-hyperactivity dis-order is a common associated diagnosis. Learning disabili-ties or mental retardation may be diagnosed during thistime. Arithmetic is often the most difficult subject for achild with FAS. During middle school and high schoolyears the behavioral difficulties and learning difficultiescan be significant. Memory problems, poor judgment, dif-ficulties with daily living skills, difficulties with abstractreasoning skills, and poor social skills are often apparentby this time. It is important to note that animal and humanstudies have shown that neurologic and behavioral abnor-malities can be present without characteristic facial fea-tures. These individuals may not be identified as havingFAS, but may fulfill criteria for alcohol- related diagnoses,as set forth by the Institute of Medicine.\nIn 1991, Streissguth and others reported some of the\nfirst long-term follow-up studies of adolescents andadults with FAS. In the approximate 60 individuals theystudied, the average IQ was 68, with 70 being the lowerlimit of the normal range. However, the range of IQ wasquite large, as low as 20 (severely retarded) to as high as105 (normal). The average achievement levels for read-ing, spelling, and arithmetic were fourth grade, thirdgrade and second grade, respectively. The VinelandAdaptive Behavior Scale was used to measure adaptivefunctioning in these individuals. The composite score forthis group showed functioning at the level of a seven-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1310Fetal alcohol syndromeyear-old. Daily living skills were at a level of nine years,\nand social skills were at the level of a six-year-old.\nIn 1996, Streissguth and others published further data\nregarding the disabilities in children, adolescents andadults with FAS. Secondary disabilities, that is, those dis-abilities not present at birth and that might be preventablewith proper diagnosis, treatment, and intervention, weredescribed. These secondary disabilities include: mentalhealth problems; disrupted school experiences; troublewith the law; incarceration for mental health problems,drug abuse, or a crime; inappropriate sexual behavior;alcohol and drug abuse; problems with employment;dependent living; and difficulties parenting their own chil-dren. In that study, only seven out of 90 adults were livingand working independently and successfully. In additionto the studies by Streissguth, several other authors in dif-ferent countries have now reported on long term outcomeof individuals diagnosed with FAS. In general, the neuro-logic, behavioral and emotional disorders become themost problematic for the individuals. The physical featureschange over time, sometimes making the correct diagnosismore difficult in older individuals, without old pho-tographs and other historical data to review. Mental healthproblems including attention deficit, depression, panicattacks, psychosis and suicide threats and attempts, and\noverall were present in over 90% of the individuals studiedby Streissguth. A 1996 study in Germany reported morethan 70% of the adolescents they studied had persistentand severe developmental disabilities and many had psy-chiatric disorders, the most common of which were emo-tional disorders, repetitive habits, speech disorders , and\nhyperactivity disorders.\nDiagnosis\nFAS is a clinical diagnosis, which means that there\nis no blood, x ray or psychological test that can be per-formed to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The diagno-sis is made based on the history of maternal alcohol use,and detailed physical examination for the characteristic\nmajor and minor birth defects and characteristic facialfeatures. It is often helpful to examine siblings and par-ents of an individual suspected of having FAS, either inperson or by photographs, to determine whether findingson the examination might be familial, of if other siblingsmay also be affected. Sometimes, genetic tests are per-formed to rule out other conditions that may present withdevelopmental delay or birth defects. Individuals withdevelopmental delay, birth defects or other unusual fea-tures are often referred to a clinical geneticist, develop-mental pediatrician, or neurologist for evaluation anddiagnosis of FAS. Psychoeducational testing to deter-mine IQ and/or the presence of learning disabilities mayalso be part of the evaluation process.KEY TERMS\nCleft palate —A congenital malformation in which\nthere is an abnormal opening in the roof of themouth that allows the nasal passages and themouth to be improperly connected.\nCongenital —Refers to a disorder which is present\nat birth.\nIQ—Abbreviation for Intelligence Quotient. Com-\npares an individual’s mental age to his/her true orchronological age and multiplies that ratio by 100.\nMicrocephaly —An abnormally small head.\nMiscarriage —Spontaneous pregnancy loss.\nPlacenta —The organ responsible for oxygen and\nnutrition exchange between a pregnant motherand her developing baby.\nStrabismus —An improper muscle balance of the\nocular musles resulting in crossed or divergent eyes.\nTeratogen —Any drug, chemical, maternal disease,\nor exposure that can cause physical or functionaldefects in an exposed embryo or fetus.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment for FAS that will reverse or\nchange the physical features or brain damage associatedwith maternal alcohol use during the pregnancy. Most ofthe birth defects associated with prenatal alcohol expo-sure are correctable with surgery. Children should havepsychoeducational evaluation to help plan appropriateeducational interventions. Common associated diagnosessuch as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, depres-sion, or anxiety should be recognized and treated appro-\npriately. The disabilities that present during childhoodpersist into adult life. However, some of the secondarydisabilities mentioned above may be avoided or lessenedby early and correct diagnosis, better understanding ofthe life-long complications of FAS, and intervention.Streissguth has describe a model in which an individualaffected by FAS has one or more advocates to help pro-vide guidance, structure and support as the individualseeks to become independent, successful in school oremployment, and develop satisfying social relationships.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for FAS depends on the severity of\nbirth defects and the brain damage present at birth. Mis-\ncarriage ,stillbirth or death in the first few weeks of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1311Fetal alcohol syndromelife may be outcomes in very severe cases. Major birth\ndefects associated with FAS are usually treatable withsurgery. Some of the factors that have been found toreduce the risk of secondary disabilities in FAS individ-uals include diagnosis before the age of six years, stableand nurturing home environments, never having experi-enced personal violence, and referral and eligibility fordisability services. The long-term data helps in under-standing the difficulties that individuals with FASencounter throughout their lifetime and can help fami-lies, caregivers and professionals provide the care,supervision, education and treatment geared towardtheir special needs.\nPrevention of FAS is the key. Prevention efforts must\ninclude public education efforts aimed at the entire popu-lation, not just women of child bearing age, appropriatetreatment for women with high-risk drinking habits, andincreased recognition and knowledge about FAS by pro-fessionals, parents, and caregivers.\nResources\nBOOKS\nJones, Kenneth Lyons.

    "content": "Fetal hemoglobin test\nDefinition\nFetal hemoglobin (Hemoglobin F), Alkali-resistant\nhemoglobin, HBF (or Hb F), is the major hemoglobincomponent in the bloodstream of the fetus. After birth, itdecreases rapidly until only traces are found in normalchildren and adults.\nPurpose\nThe determination of fetal hemoglobin is an aid in\nevaluating low concentrations of hemoglobin in theblood (anemia), as well as the hereditary persistence offetal hemoglobin, and a group of inherited disordersaffecting hemoglobin, among which are the thalassemiasand sickle cell anemia.\nDescription\nAt birth, the newborn’s blood is comprised of\n60%–90% of fetal hemoglobin. The fetal hemoglobinthen rapidly decreases to 2% or less after the second tofourth years. By the time of adulthood, only traces (0.5%or less) are found in the bloodstream.\nIn some diseases associated with abnormal hemo-\nglobin production (see Hemoglobinopathy, below), fetalhemoglobin may persist in larger amounts. When thisoccurs, the elevation raises the question of possibleunderlying disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1312Fetal hemoglobin testFor example, HBF can be found in higher levels in\nhereditary hemolytic anemias , in all types of leukemias,\nin pregnancy , diabetes, thyroid disease, and during anti-\nconvulsant drug therapy. It may also reappear in adultswhen the bone marrow is overactive, as in the disordersof pernicious anemia ,multiple myeloma , and metastat-\nic cancer in the marrow. When HBF is increased after\nage four, it should be investigated for cause.\nHemoglobinopathy\nHemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying pigment found\nin red blood cells. It is a large molecule made in the bonemarrow from two components, heme and globin.\nDefects in hemoglobin production may be either\ngenetic or acquired. The genetic defects are further sub-divided into errors of heme production (porphyria), andthose of globin production (known collectively as thehemoglobinopathies ).\nThere are two categories of hemoglobinopathy. In\nthe first category, abnormal globin chains give rise toabnormal hemoglobin molecules. In the second category,normal hemoglobin chains are produced but in abnormalamounts. An example of the first category is the disorderof sickle cell anemia, the inherited condition character-ized by curved (sickle-shaped) red blood cells and chron-ic hemolytic anemia . Disorders in the second category\nare called the thalassemias, which are further dividedinto types according to which amino acid chain is affect-ed (alpha or beta), and whether there is one defectivegene ( thalassemia minor) or two defective genes (tha-\nlassemia major).\nPreparation\nThis test requires a blood sample. The patient is not\nrequired to be in a fasting state (nothing to eat or drink\nfor a period of hours before the test).\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\nNormal results\nReference values vary from laboratory to laboratory\nbut are generally found within the following ranges:\n• six months to adult: up to 2% of the total hemoglobin• newborn to six months: up to 75% of the total hemoglo-\nbinKEY TERMS\nAnemia —A disorder characterized by a reduced\nblood level of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carryingpigment of blood.\nHemolytic anemia —A form of anemia caused by\npremature destruction of red cells in the bloodstream (a process called hemolysis). Hemolyticanemias are classified according to whether thecause of the problem is inside the red blood cell(in which case it is usually an inherited condition),or outside the cell (usually acquired later in life).\nAbnormal results\nGreater than 2% of total hemoglobin is abnormal.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

    "title": "Fever",
    "content": "Fever\nDefinition\nA fever is any body temperature elevation over\n100°F (37.8°C).\nDescription\nA healthy person’s body temperature fluctuates\nbetween 97°F (36.1°C) and 100°F (37.8°C), with theaverage being 98.6°F (37°C). The body maintains stabili-ty within this range by balancing the heat produced by themetabolism with the heat lost to the environment. The“thermostat” that controls this process is located in thehypothalamus, a small structure located deep within thebrain. The nervous system constantly relays informationabout the body’s temperature to the thermostat, which inturn activates different physical responses designed to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1313Fevercool or warm the body, depending on the circumstances.\nThese responses include: decreasing or increasing theflow of blood from the body’s core, where it is warmed,to the surface, where it is cooled; slowing down or speed-ing up the rate at which the body turns food into energy(metabolic rate); inducing shivering, which generates heatthrough muscle contraction; and inducing sweating,which cools the body through evaporation.\nA fever occurs when the thermostat resets at a higher\ntemperature, primarily in response to an infection. Toreach the higher temperature, the body moves blood tothe warmer interior, increases the metabolic rate, andinduces shivering. The “chills” that often accompany afever are caused by the movement of blood to the body’score, leaving the surface and extremities cold. Once thehigher temperature is achieved, the shivering and chillsstop. When the infection has been overcome or drugssuch as aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) have been\ntaken, the thermostat resets to normal and the body’scooling mechanisms switch on: the blood moves to thesurface and sweating occurs.Fever is an important component of the immune\nresponse, though its role is not completely understood.Physicians believe that an elevated body temperature hasseveral effects. The immune system chemicals that reactwith the fever-inducing agent and trigger the resetting ofthe thermostat also increase the production of cells thatfight off the invading bacteria or viruses. Higher temper-atures also inhibit the growth of some bacteria, while atthe same time speeding up the chemical reactions thathelp the body’s cells repair themselves. In addition, theincreased heart rate that may accompany the changes inblood circulation also speeds the arrival of white bloodcells to the sites of infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nFevers are primarily caused by viral or bacterial\ninfections, such as pneumonia or influenza . However,\nother conditions can induce a fever, including allergicreactions; autoimmune diseases; trauma, such as breakinga bone; cancer ; excessive exposure to the sun; intense\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1314Fever\nF.G.A.\nC.B.\nD.\nE.\nA dramatic rise in body temperature often includes the following symptoms: A. Loss of fluid results in dehydration. B.The\nhypothalamic set-point is increased, raising metabolism. C. Blood vessels in skin dilate. D. Sweat glands produce excessperspiration. E. Increased pulse rate. F. Increased hypothalmic set-point may introduce chills and shivering to promote heatproduction from muscles. G. Skin becomes more heat-sensitive. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)exercise ; hormonal imbalances; certain drugs; and dam-\nage to the hypothalamus. When an infection occurs,fever-inducing agents called pyrogens are released, eitherby the body’s immune system or by the invading cellsthemselves, that trigger the resetting of the thermostat. Inother circumstances, the immune system may overreact(allergic reactions) or become damaged (autoimmune dis-eases), causing the uncontrolled release of pyrogens. Astroke or tumor can damage the hypothalamus, causing\nthe body’s thermostat to malfunction. Excessive exposureto the sun or intensely exercising in hot weather can resultin heat stroke, a condition in which the body’s coolingmechanisms fail. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare, inher-ited condition in which a person develops a very highfever when given certain anesthetics or muscle relaxants\nin preparation for surgery.\nHow long a fever lasts and how high it may go\ndepends on several factors, including its cause, the age ofthe patient, and his or her overall health. Most feverscaused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly andthen dissipating as the immune system defeats the infec-tious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fallthroughout the day, reaching its peek in the late after-noon or early evening. A low-grade fever that lasts forseveral weeks is associated with autoimmune diseasessuch as lupus or with some cancers, particularlyleukemia and lymphoma.\nDiagnosis\nA fever is usually diagnosed using a thermometer. A\nvariety of different thermometers are available, includingtraditional glass and mercury ones used for oral or rectaltemperature readings and more sophisticated electronicones that can be inserted in the ear to quickly register thebody’s temperature. For adults and older children, temper-ature readings are usually taken orally. Younger childrenwho cannot or will not hold a thermometer in their mouthscan have their temperature taken by placing an oral ther-mometer under their armpit. Infants generally have theirtemperature taken rectally using a rectal thermometer.\nAs important as registering a patient’s temperature is\ndetermining the underlying cause of the fever. The pres-ence or absence of accompanying symptoms, a patient’smedical history, and information about what he or shemay have ingested, any recent trips taken, or possibleexposures to illness help the physician make a diagnosis.Blood tests can aid in identifying an infectious agent bydetecting the presence of antibodies against it or provid-ing samples for growth of the organism in a culture.Blood tests can also provide the doctor with white bloodcell counts.

Also, because\na fever helps the immune system fight infection, it usual-ly should be allowed to run its course. Drugs to lowerfever (antipyretics) can be given if a patient (particularlya child) is uncomfortable. These include aspirin, aceta-minophen (Tylenol), and ibuprofin (Advil). Aspirin,however, should not be given to a child or adolescentwith a fever since this drug has been linked to anincreased risk of Reye’s syndrome . Bathing a patient in\ncool water can also help alleviate a high fever.\nA fever requires emergency treatment under the fol-\nlowing circumstances:\n• newborn (three months or younger) with a fever over\n100.5°F (38°C)\n• infant or child with a fever over 103°F (39.4°C)• fever accompanied by severe headache , neck stiffness,\nmental confusion, or severe swelling of the throat\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1315FeverA very high fever in a small child can trigger\nseizures (febrile seizures) and therefore should be treatedimmediately. A fever accompanied by the above symp-toms can indicate the presence of a serious infection,such as meningitis , and should be brought to the imme-\ndiate attention of a physician.\nPrognosis\nMost fevers caused by infection end as soon as the\nimmune system rids the body of the pathogen and do notproduce any lasting effects. The prognosis for feversassociated with more chronic conditions, such as autoim-mune disease, depends upon the overall outcome of thedisorder.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J.

    "title": "Fever evaluation tests",
    "content": "Fever evaluation tests\nDefinition\nFever evaluation tests, better known as febrile\nagglutinins tests, are performed to detect the presence ofantibodies in the blood that are sensitive to temperaturechanges. Antibodies are proteins produced by theimmune system in response to specific infectious agents,such as viruses or bateria. Febrile agglutinins are anti-bodies that cause red blood cells to clump, but only whenthe blood is warmed to temperatures higher than theaverage body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C).\nPurpose\nThe febrile agglutinins test is used to confirm the\ndiagonsis of certain infectious diseases that stimulate thebody to produce febrile agglutinins. The disease mostcommonly diagnosed by this test is brucellosis , a infec-\ntion caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Brucellaand characterized by intermittent fever, sweating, chills,\naches, and mental depression. The test is also used todiagnose certain other infectious diseases: salmonellosis,caused by Salmonella bacteria and marked by nausea and\nsevere diarrhea ; rickettsial infections, a group of dis-\neases caused by the bacteria Rickettsia ; and tularemia ,\nalso called rabbit fever, a bacterial infection character-ized by a high fever and swollen lymph nodes. Thefebrile agglutinins test can also be used to confirm thepresence of two types of cancer , leukemia and lym-\nphoma; however, doctors rarely use the test for this pur-pose, since other diagnostic tests are more reliable.\nDescription\nA febrile agglutinins test can be performed at a doc-\ntor’s office or a hospital. A nurse or technician will col-lect a few drops of blood (about 7ml) in a small tube thathas been cooled slightly. The specimen is then taken to alaboratory where it heated and examined for clumping. Ifthe cells clump after warming and unclump as they cool,a febrile agglutinin titer (concentration) of greater than1:80 is present.\nNormal results\nThe results of febrile agglutinins tests require a doc-\ntor’s interpretation. In general, however, a normal valueis lower than 1:32.\nAbnormal results\nAn value higher than 1:80 suggests a diagnosis for\nbrucellosis or one of the other conditions indicated bythis test.\nJill S.

    "title": "Fever of unknown origin",
    "content": "Fever of unknown origin\nDefinition\nFever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to the pres-\nence of a documented fever for a specified time, forwhich a cause has not been found after a basic medicalevaluation. The classic criteria developed in 1961 includ-ed: temperature greater than 101°F (38.3°C), for at leastthree weeks, and inability to find a cause after one weekof study. Within the past decade, a revision has been pro-posed that categorizes FUO into classic, hospitalacquired FUO, FUO associated with low white bloodcounts, and HIV associated FUO ( AIDS related).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1316Fever evaluation testsDescription\nFever is a natural response of the body that helps in\nfighting off foreign substances, such as microorganisms,toxins, etc. Body temperature is set by the thermoregula-tory center, located in an area in the brain called hypo-thalamus. Body temperature is not constant all day, butactually is lowest at 6 \nA.M. and highest around 4–6 P.M. In\naddition, temperature varies in different regions of thebody; for example, rectal and urine temperatures areabout one degree Fahrenheit higher than oral temperatureand rectal temperature is higher than urine. It is alsoimportant to realize that certain normal conditions caneffect body temperature, such as pregnancy , food inges-\ntion, age, and certain hormonal changes.\nSubstances that cause fever are known as “pyro-\ngens.” There are two types of pyrogens; exogenous andendogenous. Those that originate outside the body, suchas bacterial toxins, are called “exogenous” pyrogens.Pyrogens formed by the body’s own cells in response toan outside stimulus (such as a bacterial toxin) are called“endogenous” pyrogens.\nResearchers have discovered that there are several\n“endogenous” pyrogens. These are made up of smallgroups of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.These natural pyrogens have other functions in additionto inducing fever; they have been named “cytokines”.When cytokines are injected into humans, fever andchills develop within an hour. Interferon, tumor necrosisfactor, and various interleukins are the major fever pro-ducing cytokines.\nThe production of fever is a very complex process;\nsomehow, these cytokines cause the thermoregulatorycenter in the hypothalamus to reset the normal tempera-ture level. The body’s initial response is to conserve heatby vasoconstriction, a process in which blood vessels nar-row and prevent heat loss from the skin and elsewhere.This alone will raise temperature by two to three degrees.Certain behavioral activities also occur, such as addingmore clothes, seeking a warmer environment, etc. If thehypothalamus requires more heat, then shivering occurs.\nFever is a body defense mechanism. It has been\nshown that one of the effects of temperature increase is toslow bacterial growth. However, fever also has somedownsides; the body’s metabolic rate is increased andwith it, oxygen consumption. This can have a devastatingeffect on those with poor circulation. In addition, fevercan lead to seizures in the very young.\nWhen temperature elevation occurs for an extended\nperiod of time and no cause is found, the term FUO isthen used. The far majority of these patients are eventual-ly found to have one of several diseases.KEY TERMS\nAIDS —Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is\noften represented by these initials. The disease isassociated with infection by the human immunod-eficiency virus (HIV), and has the main feature ofrepeated infections, due to failure of certain partsof the immune system. Infection by HIV damagespart of the body’s natural immunity, and leads torecurrent illnesses.\nAntibiotic —A medication that is designed to kill\nor weaken bacteria.\nComputed tomography scan (CT Scan) —A spe-\ncialized x-ray procedure in which cross-sectionsof the area in question can be examined in detail.This allows physicians to examine organs such asthe pancreas, bile ducts, and others which areoften the site of hidden infections.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) —This is a\nnew technique similar to CT Scan, but based onthe magnetic properties of various areas of thebody to compose images.\nNSAID —Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nare medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen thatdecrease pain and inflammation. Many can nowbe obtained without a doctor’s prescription.\nUltrasound —A non-invasive procedure based on\nchanges in sound waves of a frequency that can-not be heard, but respond to changes in tissuecomposition. It is very useful for diagnosing dis-eases of the gallbladder, liver, and hidden infec-tions, such as abscesses.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most frequent cause of FUO is still infection,\nthough the percentage has decreased in recent years.Tuberculosis remains an important cause, especially\nwhen it occurs outside the lungs. The decrease in infec-tions as a cause of FUO is due in part to improved culturetechniques. In addition, technological advances havemade it easier to diagnose non-infectious causes. Forexample, tumors and autoimmune diseases in particularare now easier to diagnose. (An autoimmune disease isone that arises when the body tolerance for its own cellantigenic cell markers disappears.)\nAllergies to medications can also cause prolonged\nfever; sometimes patients will have other symptoms sug-gesting an allergic reaction, such as a rash.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1317Fever of unknown originThere are many possible causes of FUO; generally\nthough, a diagnosis can be found. About 10% of patientswill wind up without a definite cause, and about the samepercentage have “factitious fevers” (either self inducedor no fever at all).\nSome general symptoms tend to occur along with\nfever; these are called constitutional symptoms and con-sist of myalgias (muscle aches), chills, and headache .\nDiagnosis\nFew symptoms in medicine present such a diagnos-\ntic challenge as fever. Nonetheless, if a careful, logical,and thorough evaluation is performed, a diagnosis will befound in most cases. The patient’s past medical history aswell as travel, social, and family history should be care-fully searched for important clues.\nUsually the first step is to search for an infectious\ncause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such astuberculosis, and examination of blood, urine, and stool,are generally indicated. Antibody levels to a number ofinfectious agents can be measured; if these are rising,they may point to an active infection.\nVarious x-ray studies are also of value. In addition to\nstandard examinations, recently developed radiologicaltechniques using ultrasound, computed tomography scan(CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\nare now available. These enable physicians to examineareas that were once accessible only through surgery. Fur-thermore, new studies using radioactive materials (nuclearmedicine), can detect areas of infection and inflammationpreviously almost impossible to find, even with surgery.\nBiopsies of any suspicious areas found on an x-ray\nexam can be performed by either traditional or newersurgical techniques. Material obtained by biopsy is thenexamined by a pathologist to look for clues as to thecause of the fever. Evidence of infection, tumor or otherdiseases can be found in this way. Portions of the biopsyare also sent to the laboratory for culture in an attempt togrow and identify an infectious organism.\nPatients with HIV are an especially difficult prob-\nlem, as they often suffer from many unusual infections.HIV itself is a potential cause of fever.\nTreatment\nMost patients who undergo evaluation for FUO do not\nreceive treatment until a clear-cut cause is found. Antibi-\notics or medications designed to suppress a fever (such as\nNSAIDs) will only hide the true cause. Once physicians aresatisfied that there is no infectious cause, they may use med-ications such as NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to decrease\ninflammation and diminish constitutional symptoms.The development of FUO in certain settings, such as\nthat acquired by patients in the hospital or in those with alow white blood count , often needs rapid treatment to\navoid serious complications. Therefore, in these instancespatients may be placed on antibiotics after a minimalnumber of diagnostic studies. Once test results areknown, treatment can be adjusted as needed.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for patients with FUO depends on the\ncause of the fever. If the basic illness is easily treatableand can be found rather quickly, the potential for a cureis quite good. Some patients continue with temperatureelevations for six months or more; if no serious disease isfound, medications such as NSAIDs are used to decreasethe effects of the fever. Careful follow-up and reevalua-tion is recommended in these cases.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGelfand, Jeffrey A., and Charles A.

    "content": "Fibrin split products\nDefinition\nFibrin split products (FSP) are fragments of protein\nreleased from a dissolving clot. The fibrin split productstest is one of several tests done to evaluate a person with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1318Fibrin split productsblood clotting problems (coagulation), particularly dis-\nseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\nPurpose\nHigh levels of FSP in a person’s blood are associated\nwith DIC, a serious medical condition that developswhen the normal balance between bleeding and clottingis disturbed. Excessive bleeding and clotting injuresbody organs, and causes anemia or death .\nDescription\nCoagulation begins typically with an injury to some\npart of the body. The injury sets in motion a cascade ofbiochemical activities (the coagulation cascade) to stopthe bleeding, by forming a clot from a mixture of theblood protein fibrin and platelets.\nOnce bleeding is stopped, another blood protein dis-\nsolves the clot by breaking down the fibrin into frag-ments. Measurement of these fragments gives informa-tion about the clot dissolving portion of coagulation,called fibrinolysis.\nIn DIC, the coagulation cascade is triggered in an\nabnormal way. A blood infection, a transfusion reaction,\na large amount of tissue damage, such as a burn, a deadfetus, and some cancers can begin the chain of biochemi-cal events leading to blood clots. The coagulation cas-cade becomes overwhelmed with excessive clotting fol-lowed by excessive bleeding. As the large number ofclots dissolve, fibrin split products accumulate in theblood and encourage even more bleeding.\nLaboratory tests for FSP are done on the yellow liq-\nuid portion left over after blood clots (serum). A person’sserum is mixed with a substance that binds to FSP. Thisbound complex is measured, and the original amount ofFSP is determined. Some test methods give an actualmeasurement of FSP; some give a titer, or dilution.Methods that provide a titer look for the presence orabsence of FSP. If the serum is positive for FSP, theserum is diluted, or titered, and the test is done again.These steps are repeated until the serum is so dilute thatit no longer gives a positive result. The last dilution thatgives a positive result is the titer reported.\nThe FSP test is covered by insurance when medical-\nly necessary. Results are usually available within one totwo hours.

    "title": "Fibrinogen test",
    "content": "Fibrinogen test\nDefinition\nFibrinogen (Factor I) is a protein that originates in\nthe liver. It is converted to fibrin during the blood-clot-ting process (coagulation).\nPurpose\nThe fibrinogen test aids in the diagnosis of suspected\nclotting or bleeding disorders caused by fibrinogenabnormalities.\nPrecautions\nThis test is not recommended for patients with active\nbleeding, acute infection or illness, or in those patientswho have received blood transfusions within four weeks.\nDrugs that may increase fibrinogen levels include\nestrogens and oral contraceptives . Drugs that may cause\ndecreased levels include anabolic steroids, androgens,phenobarbital, urokinase, streptokinase, and valproic acid.\nDescription\nFibrinogen plays two essential roles in the body: it is\na protein called an acute-phase reactant that becomes ele-vated with tissue inflammation or tissue destruction, andit is also a vital part of the “common pathway” of thecoagulation process.\nIn order for blood to clot, fibrinogen must be con-\nverted to fibrin by the action of an enzyme called throm-bin. Fibrin molecules clump together to form long fila-ments, which trap blood cells to form a solid clot.The conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is the last step\nof the “coagulation cascade,” a series of reactions in theblood triggered by tissue injury and platelet activation.With each step in the cascade, a coagulation factor in theblood is converted from an inactive to an active form.The active form of the factor then activates several mole-cules of the next factor in the series, and so on, until thefinal step, when fibrinogen is converted into fibrin.\nThe factors involved in the coagulation cascade are\nnumbered I, II, and V through XIII. Factor I is fibrino-gen, while factor II (fibrinogen’s immediate precursor) iscalled prothrombin. Most of the coagulation factors aremade in the liver, which needs an adequate supply of vit-amin K to manufacture the different clotting factors.\nWhen fibrinogen acts as an “acute-phase reactant,” it\nrises sharply during tissue inflammation or injury. Whenthis occurs, high fibrinogen levels may be a predictor foran increased risk of heart or circulatory disease. Otherconditions in which fibrinogen is elevated are cancers ofthe stomach, breast, or kidney, and inflammatory disor-ders like rheumatoid arthritis .\nReduced fibrinogen levels can be found in liver dis-\nease, prostate cancer , lung disease, bone marrow\nlesions, malnourishment, and certain bleeding disorders.The low levels can be used to evaluate disseminatedintravascular coagulation (DIS), a serious medical condi-tion that develops when there is a disturbed balancebetween bleeding and clotting. Other conditions relatedto decreased fibrinogen levels are those in which fibrino-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1320Fibrinogen testgen is completely absent (congenital afibrinogenemia),\nconditions in which levels are low (hypofibrinogenemia),and conditions of abnormal fibrinogen (dysfibrinogene-mia). Obstetric complications or trauma may also causelow levels. Large-volume blood transfusions cause lowlevels because banked blood does not contain fibrinogen.\nPreparation\nThis test is performed with a blood sample, which\ncan be drawn at any time of day. The patient does nothave to be fasting (nothing to eat or drink).\nAftercare\nBecause a fibrinogen test is often ordered when a\nbleeding disorder is suspected, the patient should applypressure or a pressure dressing to the blood-drawn sitesite for a period of time after blood is drawn, and thenreexamine the site for bleeding.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include slight\nbleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or feeling\nlightheaded after procedure, or the seeing the accumula-tion of blood under the puncture site (hematoma).\nNormal results\nNormal reference ranges are laboratory-specific, but\nare usually within the following:\n• adult: 200 mg/dL–400 mg/dL\n• newborn: 125 mg/dL–300 mg/dL\nAbnormal results\nSpontaneous bleeding can occur with values less\nthan 100 mg/dL.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

Flores\nFibrocystic breast disease seeFibrocystic\ncondition of the breastFibroadenoma\nDefinition\nFibroadenomas are benign breast tumors commonly\nfound in young women. Fibroadenoma means “a tumorcomposed of glandular (related to gland) and fibrous(containing fibers) tissues.”\nDescription\nBreast fibroadenomas, abnormal growths of glandu-\nlar and fibrous tissues, are most common between theages of 15 and 30, and are found in 10% of all women(20% of African-American women). They are foundrarely in postmenopausal women.\nDescribed as feeling like marbles, these firm, round,\nmovable, and “rubbery” lumps range from 1–5 cm in size.Giant fibroadenomas are larger, lemon-sized lumps. Usuallysingle, from 10–15% of women have more than one.\nWhile some types of breast lumps come and go dur-\ning the menstrual cycle, fibroadenomas typically do notdisappear after a woman’s period, and should be checkedby a doctor.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of breast fibroadenomas is unknown.\nThey may be dependent upon estrogen, because they arecommon in premenopausal women, can be found in post-menopausal women taking estrogen, and because theygrow larger in pregnant women.\nFibroadenomas usually cause no symptoms and may\nbe discovered during breast self-examination , or during\na routine check-up.\nDiagnosis\nWhen the doctor takes a complete medical history,\nthey will ask when the lump was first noticed, if therewere any symptoms or changes in lump size, and if thereis any personal or family history of breast disease.\nThe doctor thoroughly feels the breasts (palpates).\nTests are done, usually including mammography or\nultrasound scans, or surgical removal of cells or tissuefor examination under a the microscope (biopsy).\nDiagnostic tests include:\n• Mammogram. An x-ray examination of the breast.• Ultrasound scan. A technique that uses sound waves to\ndisplay a two-dimensional image of the breast, showingwhether a lump is solid or fluid-filled (cystic).\n• Fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A minor procedure\nwherein fluid or cells are drawn out of the lump througha small needle (aspirated).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1321Fibroadenoma• Core biopsy. A procedure wherein a larger piece of tis-\nsue is withdrawn from the lump through a larger needle.\n• Incisional biopsy. A surgical procedure wherein a piece\nof the lump is removed through an cut (incision).\n• Excisional biopsy. A surgical procedure wherein the\nentire lump is removed through an cut (incision).\nMost insurance plans cover the costs of diagnosing\nand treating fibroadenomas.\nTreatment\nPerformed usually in outpatient settings, breast\nfibroadenomas are removed by lumpectomy , or surgi-\ncal excision under local or general anesthesia. Some-times lumps in younger women are not removed but aremonitored by self-examination, yearly doctor check-ups, and mammograms. Surgery is generally recom-mended for women over 30, and for lumps that arepainful or enlarging.\nAlternative treatments\nAlternative treatments for breast fibroadenomas\ninclude a low-fat, high-fiber, vegetarian-type diet; areduction in caffeine intake; supplementation with\nevening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis), flax oil, orfish oil and vitamins E and C; and the application of hot\ncompresses to the breast. In addition, a focus on livercleansing is important to assist the body in conjugationand elimination of excess estrogens. Botanical remediescan be useful in hormone balancing, as can acupunc-\nture and homeopathy . Massaging the breasts with cas-\ntor oil, straight or infused with herbs or essential oils,can help fibroadenomas reduce and dissipate, as well askeep women in touch with changes in their breast tissue.\nPrognosis\nBreast fibroadenomas are not cancerous. The lumps\nrecur in up to 20% of women. A small number of lumpsdisappear on their own.KEY TERMS\nAspiration —To withdraw material with a needle\nand syringe.\nBiopsy —To remove cells or tissue for microscopic\nexamination.\nEstrogen —Female sex hormone produced by the\novaries.Prevention\nBreast fibroadenomas cannot be prevented.

It has been called a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1322Fibrocystic condition of the breast“wastebasket” diagnosis because a wide range of vaguely\ndefined benign breast conditions may be labeled as fibro-cystic condition. It is not a cancer , and the majority of\ntypes of fibrocystic conditions do not increase the risk ofbreast cancer .\nDescription\nThere is no such thing as a normal or typical female\nbreast. Breasts come in all shapes and sizes, with varyingtextures from smooth to extremely lumpy. The tissues ofthe female breast change in response to hormone levels,normal aging , nursing ( lactation ), weight fluctuations,\nand injury. To further complicate matters, the breast hasseveral types of tissue; each of these tissue types mayrespond differently to changes in body chemistry.\nFibrocystic breast condition may be called fibrocystic\ndisease, although it is clearly not a single, specific diseaseprocess. Variations or changes in the way the breast feels orlooks on x ray may cause the condition to be called “fibro-cystic change.” Other names have been used to refer to thisimprecise and ill-defined term: mammary dysplasia,mastopathy, chronic cystic mastitis , indurative mastopathy,\nmastalgia, lumpy breasts, or physiologic nodularity.\nEstimates vary, but 40–90% of all women have some\nevidence of “fibrocystic” condition, change, or disease. Itis most common among women between the ages 30 and50, but may be seen at other ages.\nCauses and symptoms\nFibrocystic condition of the breast refers to technical\nfindings on diagnostic testing (signs); however, this dis-cussion focuses on symptoms that may fall under thegeneral category of the fibrocystic condition. First, abrief review of the structure and function of the breastmay be useful.\nThe breast is not supposed to be a soft, smooth organ.\nIt is actually a type of sweat gland. Milk, the breasts’ ver-sion of sweat, is secreted when the breast receives appro-priate hormonal and environmental stimulation.\nThe normal breast contains milk glands, with their\naccompanying ducts, or pipelines, for transporting themilk. These complex structures may not only alter in size,but can increase or decrease in number as needed. Fibrousconnective tissue, fatty tissue, nerves, blood and lymphvessels, and lymph nodes, with their different shapes andtextures, lie among the ever-changing milk glands. It is nowonder that a woman’s breasts may not feel uniform intexture and that the “lumpiness” may wax and wane.\nThe fibrocystic condition refers to the tenderness,\nenlargement, and/or changing “lumpiness” that manywomen encounter just before or during their menstrual\nperiods. At this time, female hormones are preparing thebreasts for pregnancy , by stimulating the milk-produc-\ning cells, and storing fluid. Each breast may contain asmuch as three to six teaspoons of excess fluid. Swelling,with increased sensitivity or pain , may result. If preg-\nnancy does not occur, the body reabsorbs the fluid, andthe engorgement and discomfort are relieved.\nSymptoms of fibrocystic breast condition range\nfrom mildly annoying in some women to extremelypainful in others. The severity of discomfort may varyfrom month to month in the same woman. Althoughsometimes distressing, this experience is the body’s nor-mal response to routine hormonal changes.\nThis cycle of breast sensitivity, pain and/or enlarge-\nment, can also result from medications. Some hormonereplacement therapies (estrogen and progesterone) usedfor postmenopausal women can produce these effects.Other medications, primarily, but not exclusively thosewith hormones may also provoke these symptoms.\nBreast pain unrelated to hormone shifts is called\n“noncyclic” pain. “Trigger-zone breast pain” is a termthat may also be used to describe this area-specific pain.This type of pain may be continuous, or it may be feltintermittently. Trauma, such as a blow to the chest area, aprior breast biopsy , or sensitivity to certain medications\nmay also underlie this type of pain. Fibrocystic conditionof the breast may be cited as the cause of otherwise unex-plained breast pain.\nLumps, apart from those clearly associated with hor-\nmone cycles, may also be placed under the heading offibrocystic condition. These lumps stand out from enlargedgeneral breast tissue. Although noncancerous lumps mayoccur, the obvious concern with such lumps is cancer.\nNoncancerous breast lumps include:\n• Adenosis. This condition refers to the enlargement of\nbreast lobules, which contain a greater number of glandsthan usual. If a group of lobules are found near eachother, the affected area may be large enough to be felt.\n• Cysts. These are fluid-filled sacs in the breast and proba-\nbly develop as ducts that become clogged with old cellsin the process of normal emptying and filling. Cysts usu-ally feel soft and round or oval. However a cyst deepwithin the breast may feel hard, as it pushes up againstfirmer breast tissue. A woman with a cyst may experi-ence pain, especially if it increases in size before hermenstrual cycle, as is often the case. Women between theage of 30 and 50 are most likely to develop cysts.\n• Epithelial hyperplasia. Also called proliferative breast\ndisease, this condition refers to an overgrowth of cellslining either the ducts or the lobules.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1323Fibrocystic condition of the breast• Fibroadenomas. These are tumors that form in the tis-\nsues outside the milk ducts. The cause of fibroadeno-mas is unknown. They generally feel smooth and firm,with a somewhat rubber-like texture. Typically afibroadenoma is not attached to surrounding tissue and\nmoves slightly when touched. They are most common-ly found in adolescents and women in their early twen-ties but can occur at any age.\n• Fibrosis. Sometimes one area of breast tissue persistently\nfeels thicker or more prominent than the rest of the breast.This feeling may be caused by old hardened scar tissueand/or dead fat tissue as a result of surgery or trauma.Often the cause of this type of breast tissue is unknown.\n• Miscellaneous disorders. A number of other benign\n(noncancerous) breast problems may be placed underthe heading of “fibrocystic condition.” These problemsinclude disorders that may lead to breast inflammation(mastitis), infection, and/or nipple discharge.\nAtypical ductal hyperplasia\nThe condition known as atypical ductal hyperplasia\n(ADH) is a condition in which the cells lining the milkducts of the breast are growing abnormally. This condi-tion may appear as spots of calcium salts, or calcifica-tions, on the mammogram. A biopsy removed from thebreast would confirm the diagnosis. Atypical ductalhyperplasia is not a cancer. In most women, this condi-tion will cause no problems. However, for some women,especially women with family histories of breast cancer,the risk of developing breast cancer is increased. (One\nstudy with over 3,000 female participants indicated thatabout 20% of the participants with atypical hyperplasiaand a family history of breast cancer developed breastcancer, as compared to the 8% of participants who devel-oped the disease with atypical hyperplasia and no familyhistory of breast cancer.) For women with ADH and afamily history of breast cancer, more frequent mammo-grams and closer monitoring may be required.\nDiagnosis\nBreast cancer is the most common concern of\nwomen who feel a breast lump or experience an abnor-mal breast symptom. For peace of mind, and to rule outany possibility of cancer, any newly discovered breastlumps should be brought to the attention of a familyphysician or an obstetrician-gynecologist. He or she willobtain a history and conduct thorough physical exami-\nnation of the area. Depending on the findings on physi-\ncal examination, the patient is usually referred for tests.The most common of these tests include:\n•Mammography . A mammogram is an x-ray examina-\ntion of the breasts. The two major types of abnormali-ties doctors look for are masses and calcifications;either abnormality may be benign or malignant. Thesize, shape, and edges of these masses help doctorsdetermine whether or not cancer is present. Sometimes,however, this test may be difficult to interpret, however,due to dense breast tissue.\n• Ultrasonography. If a suspicious lump is detected during\nmammography, an ultrasound (the use of high-frequen-cy sound waves to outline the shape of various organsand tissues in the body) is useful (although not defini-tive) in distinguishing benign from cancerous growths.\n• Ductography. A ductogram (also called a galactogram)\nis a test that is sometimes useful in evaluating nippledischarge. A very fine tube is threaded into the openingof the duct onto the nipple. A small amount of dye isinjected, outlining the shape of the duct on an x ray, andindicates whether or not there is a mass in the duct.\n• Biopsy. If a lump cannot be proven benign by mammog-\nraphy and ultrasound, a breast biopsy may be considered.Usually a tissue sample is removed through a needle(fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or FNAB) to obtain asample of the lump. The sample is examined under themicroscope by a pathologist, and a detailed diagnosisregarding the type of benign lesion or cancer is estab-lished. In some cases, however, FNAB may not provide aclear diagnosis, and another type of biopsy (such as asurgical biopsy, core-needle biopsy, or other stereotacticbiopsy methods—such as the Mammotome or AdvancedBreast Biopsy Instrument) may be required.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1324Fibrocystic condition of the breast\nA mammogram of a female breast indicating multiple cysts.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)Other breast conditions such as inflammation or\ninfection are usually recognized on the basis of suspi-cious history, breastfeeding, or characteristic symptomssuch as pain, redness, and swelling. A positive responseto appropriate therapies often confirms the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nOnce a specific disorder within the broad category\nof fibrocystic condition is identified, treatment can beprescribed. There are a number of treatment options forwomen with a lump that has been diagnosed as benign. Ifit is not causing a great deal of pain, the growth may beleft in the breast. However, some women may choose tohave a lump such as a fibroadenoma surgically removed,especially if it is large. Another option to relieve the dis-comfort of a painful benign lump is to have the cyst suc-tioned, or drained. If there is any uncertainty regardingdiagnosis, the fluid may be sent to the lab for analysis.\nSymptoms of cycle breast sensitivity and engorge-\nment may also be treated with diet, medication, and/orphysical modifications. For example,\n• Although there is no scientific data to support this\nclaim, many women have reported relief of symptomswhen caffeine was reduced or eliminated from their\ndiets . Decreasing salt before and during the period\nwhen breasts are most sensitive may also ease swellingand discomfort. Low-fat diets and elimination of dairyproducts also appear to decrease soreness for somewomen. However, it may take several months to realizethe effects of these various treatments.\n• Over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen\n(Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) may be recommended.In some cases, treatment with prescription drugs suchas hormones or hormone blockers may prove success-ful. Oral contraceptives may also be prescribed.\n• Warm soaks or ice packs may provide comfort. A well-\nfitted support bra can minimize physical movement anddo much to relieve breast discomfort. Breast massagemay promote removal of excess fluid from tissues andalleviate symptoms. Massaging the breast with castoroil, straight or infused with herbs or essential oils, canhelp reduce and dissipate fibroadenomas as well as keepwomen in touch with changes in their breast tissue.\n• Infections are often treated with warm compresses and\nantibiotics . Lactating women are encouraged to contin-\nue breastfeeding because it promotes drainage andhealing. However, a serious infection may progress toform an abscess that may need surgical drainage.\n• Some studies of alternative or complementary treat-\nments, although controversial, have indicated that vita-\nmins A, B complex and E, and mineral supplementsmay reduce the risk of developing fibrocystic condition\nof the breast. Evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis ),\nflaxseed oil, and fish oils have been reported to be effec-tive in relieving cyclic breast pain for some women.\nPrognosis\nMost benign breast conditions carry no increased\nrisk for the development of breast cancer. However, asmall percentage of biopsies uncover overgrowth of tis-sue in a particular pattern in some women; this patternindicates a 15–20% increased risk of breast cancer overthe next 20 years. Strict attention to early detection mea-sures, such as annual mammograms, is especially impor-tant for these women.\nPrevention\nThere is no proven method of preventing the various\nmanifestations of fibrocystic condition from occurring.Some alternative health care practitioners believe thateliminating foods high in methyl xanthines (primarilycoffee and chocolate) can decrease or reverse fibrocysticbreast changes.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGoldmann, David R., and David A.

Fibrositis, fibromyalgia, and\nfibromyositis are names given to a set of symptomsbelieved to be caused by the same general problem.\nDescription\nFibromyalgia is more common than previously\nthought, with as many as 3–6% of the population affect-ed by the disorder. Fibromyalgia is more prevalent inadults than children, with more women affected thanmen, particularly women of childbearing age.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of fibromyalgia is not known.\nSometimes it occurs in several members of a family,suggesting that it may be an inherited disorder. Peoplewith fibromyalgia are most likely to complain of threeprimary symptoms: muscle and joint pain, stiffness, andfatigue.\nPain is the major symptom with aches, tenderness,\nand stiffness of multiple muscles, joints, and soft tissues.The pain also tends to move from one part of the body toanother. It is most common in the neck, shoulders, chest,arms, legs, hips, and back. Although the pain is presentmost of the time and may last for years, the severity ofthe pain is changeable and dependent on individualpatient perception.\nSymptoms of fatigue may result from the individ-\nual’s chronic pain coupled with anxiety about the prob-\nlem and how to find relief. The inflammatory processalso produces chemicals that are known to cause fatigue.Other common symptoms are tension headaches, diffi-culty swallowing, recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea ,\nand numbness or tingling of the extremities. Stress , anxi-\nety, depression, or lack of sleep can increase symptoms.Intensity of symptoms is variable ranging from gradualimprovement to episodes of recurrent symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is difficult and frequently missed because\nsymptoms of fibromyalgia are vague and generalized.Coexisting nerve and muscle disorders such as rheuma-\ntoid arthritis , spinal arthritis, or Lyme disease may fur-\nther complicate the diagnostic process. Presently, there areno tests available to specifically diagnose fibromyalgia.The diagnosis is usually made after ruling out other med-ical conditions with similar symptoms.\nBecause of the emotional distress experienced by\npeople with this condition and the influence of stress onthe symptoms themselves, fibromyalgia has often beenlabeled a psychological problem. Recognition of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1326Fibromyalgiaunderlying inflammatory process involved in fibromyal-\ngia has helped promote the validity of this disease.\nIn 1990, the America College of Rheumatology\ndeveloped standards for fibromyalgia that health carepractitioners can use to diagnose this condition. Accord-ing to these standards, a person is thought to havefibromyalgia if he or she has widespread pain in combi-nation with tenderness in at least 11 of the 18 sitesknown as trigger points. Trigger point sites include thebase of the neck, along the backbone, in front of the hipand elbow, and at the rear of the knee and shoulder.\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure for fibromyalgia. Therefore,\nthe goal of treatment is successful symptom manage-ment. Treatment usually requires a combination of thera-pies, exercise , proper rest, and diet. A patient’s clear\nunderstanding of his or her role in the recovery process isimperative for successful management of this condition.\nTreatments found to be helpful include heat and occa-\nsionally cold applications. A regular stretching program isoften useful. Aerobic activities focusing on increasing theheart rate are the preferred forms of exercise over mostother forms of exertion. Exercise programs need to includegood warm-up and cool-down sessions, with special atten-tion given to avoiding exercises causing joint pain. Thediet should include a large variety of fruits and vegetableswhich provide the body with trace elements and minerals\nthat are necessary for healthy muscles.\nAdequate rest is essential in the treatment of\nfibromyalgia. Avoidance of stimulating foods or drinks(such as coffee) and medications like decongestants\nprior to bedtime is advised. If diet, exercise, and ade-quate rest do not relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia,medications may be prescribed. Medications prescribedand found to have some benefit include antidepressant\ndrugs ,muscle relaxants , and anti-inflammatory drugs.\nPeople with fibromyalgia often need a rheumatology\nconsultation (a meeting with a doctor who specializes indisorders of the joints, muscles, and soft tissue) to decidethe cause of various rheumatic symptoms, to be educatedabout fibromyalgia and its treatment, and to exclude otherrheumatic diseases. A treatment program must be individ-ualized to meet the patient’s needs. The rheumatologist,as the team leader, enlists and coordinates the expertise ofother health professionals in the care of the patient.\nAlternative treatment\nMassage therapy can be helpful, especially when a\nfamily member is instructed on specific massage tech-niques to manage episodes of increased symptoms. Spe-KEY TERMS\nConnective tissue —Tissue that supports and binds\nother body tissue and parts.\nLyme disease —An acute recurrent inflammatory\ndisease involving one or a few joints, believed tobe transmitted by a tickborne virus. The conditionwas originally described in the community ofLyme, Connecticut, but has also been reported inother parts of the United States and other coun-tries. Knees, other large joints are most commonlyinvolved with local inflammation and swelling.\nRheumatology —The study of disorders character-\nized by inflammation, degeneration of connectivetissue, and related structures of the body. Thesedisorders are sometimes collectively referred to asrheumatism.\ncific attention to mental health, including psychological\nconsultation, may also be important, since depressionmay precede or accompany fibromyalgia. Other alterna-tive therapies, including hellerwork ,rolfing , homeo-\npathic medicine, Chinese traditional medicine (bothacupuncture and herbs), polarity therapy , and Western\nbotanical medicine, can assist the person with fibromyal-gia to function day to day and can contribute to healing.\nPrognosis\nFibromyalgia is a chronic problem. The symptoms\nsometimes improve and at other times worsen, but theyoften continue for months to years.\nPrevention\nThere is no known or specific way to prevent\nfibromyalgia. However, similar to many other medicalconditions, remaining as healthy as possible with a gooddiet, safe exercise, and adequate rest is the best prevention.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSchumacher, H. R.

    "title": "Fifth disease",
    "content": "Fifth disease\nDefinition\nFifth disease is a mild childhood illness caused by\nthe human parvovirus B19 that causes flu-like symptomsand a rash. It is called fifth disease because it was fifth ona list of common childhood illnesses that are accompa-nied by a rash, including measles ,rubella or German\nmeasles, scarlet fever (or scarlatina), and scarlatinella, a\nvariant of scarlet fever .\nDescription\nThe Latin name for the disease is erythema infectio-\nsum, meaning infectious redness. It is also called the\n“slapped cheek disease” because, when the bright redrash first appears on the cheeks, it looks as if the face hasbeen slapped. Anyone can get the disease, but it occursmore frequently in school-aged children. The disease isusually mild, and both children and adults usually recov-er quickly without complications. In fact, some individu-als exhibit no symptoms and never even feel ill. Out-breaks most often occur in the winter and spring.\nCauses and symptoms\nFifth disease is caused by the human parvovirus B19,\na member of the Parvoviridae family of viruses, that livesin the nose and throat of the infected person. The virus isspread through the air by coughing and sneezing. Becausethe virus needs a rapidly dividing cell in order to multiply,it attacks the red blood cells of the body. Once infected, aperson is believed to be immune to reinfection.\nSymptoms may appear four to 21 days after being\nexposed to the virus. Initial symptoms are flu-like andinclude headache , body ache, sore throat , a mild fever\nof 101°F (38.3°C), and chills. It is at this time, prior tothe development of the rash, that individuals are conta-gious. These symptoms last for two to three days. In chil-dren, a bright red rash that looks like a slap mark devel-ops suddenly on the cheeks. The rash may be flat orraised and may or may not be itchy. Sometimes, the rashspreads to the arms, legs, and trunk, where it has a lace-like or net-like appearance. The rash can also involve thepalms of the hands and soles of the feet. By the time therash appears, individuals are no longer infectious. Onaverage, the rash lasts for 10–11 days, but may last for aslong as five to six weeks. The rash may fade away andthen reappear upon exposure to sunlight, hot baths, emo-tional distress, or vigorous exercise .\nAdults generally do not develop a rash, but instead may\nhave swollen and painful joints, especially in the hands andfeet. In adults, symptoms such as sore throat, headache,muscle and joint pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea , and vom-\niting occur more frequently than in children and are usuallymore severe. The joint pain can be arthritis-like and last forseveral months, especially in women, but the disease doesnot appear to progress to rheumatoid arthritis .\nThe virus causes the destruction of red blood cells\nand, therefore, a deficiency in the oxygen-carryingcapacity of the blood (anemia) can result. In healthy peo-ple, the anemia is mild and only lasts a short while. Inpeople with weakened immune systems, however, eitherbecause they have a chronic disease like AIDS or cancer\n(immunocompromised), or are receiving medication tosuppress the immune system (immunosuppressed), suchas organ transplant recipients, this anemia can be severeand last long after the infection has subsided. Symptomsof anemia include fatigue , lack of color, lack of energy,\nand shortness of breath . Some individuals with sickle\ncell anemia, iron deficiency, a number of different hered-itary blood disorders, and those who have received bonemarrow transplantations may be susceptible to develop-ing a potentially life-threatening complication called atransient aplastic crisis where the body is temporarilyunable to form new red blood cells.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1328Fifth diseaseIn very rare instances, the virus can cause inflamma-\ntion of different areas of the body, including the brain(encephalitis ), the covering of the brain and spinal cord\n(meningitis ), the lungs (pneumonitis), the liver (hepati-\ntis), and the heart muscle ( myocarditis ). The virus can\nalso aggravate symptoms for people with an autoimmunedisease called systemic lupus erythematosus .\nThere is some concern about fifth disease in pregnant\nwomen. Although no association with an increased numberof birth defects has been demonstrated, there is concern\nthat infection during the first three months of pregnancy\nmay lead to a slight increase in the number of miscarriages.There is also some concern that infection later in pregnancymay involve a very small risk of premature delivery or still-births. As a result, women who get fifth disease while theyare pregnant should be monitored closely by a physician.\nDiagnosis\nFifth disease is usually suspected based on a\npatient’s symptoms, including the typical appearance ofthe bright red rash on the cheeks, patient history, age, andthe time of year. The physician will also exclude otherpotential causes for the symptoms and rash, includingrubella, infectious mononucleosis , bacterial infections\nlike Lyme disease , allergic reactions, and lupus.\nIn addition, there is a blood test for fifth disease, but it\nis generally used only for pregnant women and for peoplewho have weakened immune systems or who suffer fromblood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia. The testinvolves measuring for a particular antibody or protein thatthe body produces in response to infection with the humanparvovirus B19. The test is 92–97% specific for this disease.\nBecause fifth disease can pose problems for an unborn\nfetus exposed to the disease through the mother, testingmay also be conducted while a fetus is still in the uterus.This test uses fluid collected from the sac around the fetus(amniotic fluid) instead of blood to detect the viral DNA.\nTreatment\nIn general, no specific treatment for fifth disease is\nrequired. The symptoms can be treated using over-thecounter medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol)\nor ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil). If the rash itches, calaminelotion can be applied. Aspirin is usually not given to\nchildren under the age of 18 to prevent the developmentof a serious illness called Reye’s syndrome .\nPatients who are receiving medications to suppress\nthe immune system in the treatment of some other condi-tion may be allowed to temporarily decrease the medica-tions in order to allow the immune system to combat theinfection and recover from the anemia. Those with weak-KEY TERMS\nAnemia —A congenital or acquired deficiency in\nthe iron-carrying capacity of the blood.\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\nimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.\nImmunocompromised —A state in which the\nimmune system is weakened or is not functioningproperly due to chronic disease.\nImmunosuppressed —A state in which the immune\nsystem is suppressed by medications during thetreatment of other disorders, like cancer, or follow-ing an organ transplantation.\nReye’s syndrome —A very serious, rare disease,\nmost common in children, that involves an upperrespiratory tract infection followed by brain andliver damage.\nSickle cell anemia —A hereditary blood disorder\nin which the red blood cells are misshapen intocrescent or sickle shapes resulting in the reducedoxygen-carrying capacity of the lungs.\nened (not suppressed) immune systems, such as AIDS\npatients, may be given immunoglobulin intravenously tohelp the immune system fight the infection. People withsevere anemia or who experience an aplastic crisis mayrequire hospitalization and blood transfusions.\nPrognosis\nGenerally, fifth disease is mild, and patients tend to\nimprove without any complications. In cases where thepatient is either immunocompromised or immunosup-pressed, a life-threatening aplastic crisis can occur. Withprompt treatment, however, the prognosis is good. Moth-ers who develop the infection while pregnant can passthe infection on to their fetus, and as such, stand anincreased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth . There are\ntests and treatments, however, that can be performed onthe fetus while still in the uterus that can reduce the riskof anemia or other complications.\nPrevention\nCurrently, there is no vaccine against fifth disease.\nAvoiding contact with persons who exhibit symptoms ofa cold and maintaining good personal hygiene by regu-larly washing hands may minimize the chances of an\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1329Fifth diseaseinfection.

    "title": "Filariasis",
    "content": "Filariasis\nDefinition\nFiliariasis is the name for a group of tropical dis-\neases caused by various thread-like parasitic roundworms (nematodes) and their larvae. The larvae transmitthe disease to humans through a mosquito bite. Filariasisis characterized by fever , chills, headache , and skin\nlesions in the early stages and, if untreated, can progress\nto include gross enlargement of the limbs and genitalia ina condition called elephantiasis .\nDescription\nApproximately 170 million people in the tropical and\nsubtropical areas of southeast Asia, South America, Africa,and the islands of the Pacific are affected by this debilitat-ing parasitic disease. While filariasis is rarely fatal, it is thesecond leading cause of permanent and long-term disabili-ty in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO)has named filariasis one of only six “potentially eradica-ble” infectious diseases and has embarked upon a 20-yearcampaign to eradicate the disease.\nIn all cases, a mosquito first bites an infected indi-\nvidual then bites another uninfected individual, transfer-ring some of the worm larvae to the new host. Once with-in the body, the larvae migrate to a particular part of thebody and mature to adult worms. Filariasis is classifiedinto three distinct types according to the part of the bodythat becomes infected: lymphatic filariasis affects the cir-culatory system that moves tissue fluid and immune cells(lymphatic system); subcutaneous filariasis infects theareas beneath the skin and whites of the eye; and serouscavity filariasis infects body cavities but does not causedisease. Several different types of worms can be respon-sible for each type of filariasis, but the most commonspecies include the following: Wucheria bancrofti, Bru-\ngia malayi (lymphatic filariasis), Onchocerca volvulus,\nLoa loa, Mansonella streptocerca, Dracunculus medi-nensis (subcutaneous filariasis), Mansonella pustans ,\nand Mansonella ozzardi (serous cavity filariasis).\nThe two most common types of the disease are Ban-\ncroftian and Malayan filariasis, both forms of lymphaticfilariasis. The Bancroftian variety is found throughoutAfrica, southern and southeastern Asia, the Pacificislands, and the tropical and subtropical regions of SouthAmerica and the Caribbean. Malayan filariasis occursonly in southern and southeastern Asia. Filariasis is occa-sionally found in the United States, especially amongimmigrants from the Caribbean and Pacific islands.\nA larvae matures into an adult worm within six\nmonths to one year and can live between four and sixyears. Each female worm can produce millions of larvae,and these larvae only appear in the bloodstream at night,when they may be transmitted, via an insect bite, to anoth-er host. A single bite is usually not enough to acquire aninfection, therefore, short-term travelers are usually safe.A series of multiple bites over a period of time is requiredto establish an infection. As a result, those individuals whoare regularly active outdoors at night and those who spendmore time in remote jungle areas are at an increased riskof contracting the filariasis infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn cases of lymphatic filariasis, the most common\nform of the disease, the disease is caused by the adultworms actually living in the lymphatic vessels near thelymph nodes where they distort the vessels and cause localinflammation. In advanced stages, the worms can actuallyobstruct the vessels, causing the surrounding tissue tobecome enlarged. In Bancroftian filariasis, the legs andgenitals are most often involved, while the Malayan vari-ety affects the legs below the knees. Repeated episodes ofinflammation lead to blockages of the lymphatic system,especially in the genitals and legs. This causes the affectedarea to become grossly enlarged, with thickened, coarseskin, leading to a condition called elephantiasis.\nIn conjunctiva filariasis, the worms’ larvae migrate\nto the eye and can sometimes be seen moving beneaththe skin or beneath the white part of the eye (conjuncti-va). If untreated, this disease can cause a type of blind-ness known as onchocerciasis.\nSymptoms vary, depending on what type of parasitic\nworm has caused the infection, but all infections usually\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1330Filariasisbegin with chills, headache, and fever between three\nmonths and one year after the insect bite. There may alsobe swelling, redness, and pain in the arms, legs, or scro-\ntum. Areas of pus (abscesses) may appear as a result ofdying worms or a secondary bacterial infection.\nDiagnosis\nThe disease is diagnosed by taking a patient history,\nperforming a physical examination , and by screening\nblood specimens for specific proteins produced by theimmune system in response to this infection (antibodies).Early diagnosis may be difficult because, in the firststages, the disease mimics other bacterial skin infections.To make an accurate diagnosis, the physician looks for apattern of inflammation and signs of lymphatic obstruc-tion, together with the patient’s possible exposure tofilariasis in an area where filariasis is common. The lar-vae (microfilariae) can also be found in the blood, butbecause mosquitos, which spread the disease, are activeat night, the larvae are usually only found in the bloodbetween about 10 pm and 2 am.\nTreatment\nEither ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarba-\nmazine is used to treat a filariasis infection by eliminat-ing the larvae, impairing the adult worms’ ability toreproduce, and by actually killing adult worms. Unfortu-nately, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible.The medication is started at low doses to prevent reac-tions caused by large numbers of dying parasites.\nWhile effective, the medications can cause severe\nside effects in up to 70% of patients as a result either ofthe drug itself or the massive death of parasites in the\nblood. Diethylcarbamazine, for example, can causesevere allergic reactions and the formation of pus-filledsores (abscesses). These side effects can be controlledusing antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs ( cor-\nticosteroids ). Rarely, treatment with diethylcarbamazine\nin someone with very high levels of parasite infectionmay lead to a fatal inflammation of the brain ( encephali-\ntis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and\nconfusion, then stupor and coma caused when massive\nnumbers of larvae and parasites die. Other common drugreactions include dizziness , weakness, and nausea.\nSymptoms caused by the death of the parasites\ninclude fever, headache, muscle pain, abdominal pain,nausea and vomiting , weakness, dizziness, lethargy, and\nasthma . Reactions usually begin within two days of start-\ning treatment and may last between two and four days.\nNo treatment can reverse elephantiasis. Surgery may\nbe used to remove surplus tissue and provide a way to drainthe fluid around the damaged lymphatic vessels. Surgery\nmay also be used to ease massive enlargement of the scro-tum. Elephantiasis of the legs can also be helped by elevat-ing the legs and providing support with elastic bandages.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook is good in early or mild cases, especially\nif the patient can avoid being infected again. The diseaseis rarely fatal, and with continued WHO medical inter-vention, even gross elephantiasis is now becoming rare.\nPrevention\nThe best method of preventing filariasis is to prevent\nbeing repeatedly bitten by the mosquitoes that carry thedisease. Some methods of preventing insect bites includethe following:\n• limit outdoor activities at night, particularly in rural or\njungle areas\n• wear long sleeves and pants and avoid dark-colored\nclothing that attracts mosquitoes\n• avoid perfumes and colognes• treat one or two sets of clothing ahead of time with per-\nmethrin (Duramon, Permanone)\n• wear DEET insect repellent or, especially for children,\ntry citronella or lemon eucalyptus, to repel insects\n• if sleeping in an open area or in a room with poor\nscreens, use a bed net to avoid being bitten while asleep\n• use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less\nactive\nIn addition, filariasis can be controlled in highly infest-\ned areas by taking ivermectin preventatively before beingbitten. Currently, there is no vaccine available, but scien-tists are working on a preventative vaccine at this time.\nResources\nBOOKS\nInfectious Disease. Ed. Barbara A. Bannister, et al.

    "title": "Fingertip injuries",
    "content": "Fingertip injuries\nDefinition\nFingertip trauma covers cuts, accumulation of blood\n(hematoma), bone breakage, or amputation in the fin-\ngertip.\nDescription\nThe fingertips are specialized areas of the hand with\nhighly developed sensory and manipulative functions.Large sensory and motor areas located in the brain regu-late the precise and delicate functions of fingertips. Thefingertip is the site where extensor and flexor tendonsinsert. Fingertip injuries are extremely common since thehands hold a wide array of objects. In 2001, the approxi-mately 10% of all accidents in the United States referredfor Emergency Room consults involve the hand. Handinjuries are frequently the result of job injuries andaccount for 11–14% of on-the-job injuries and 6% ofcompensation paid injuries. Injury to the nail bed occursin approximately 15–24% of fingertip injuries.\nFingertip injuries can result in amputation or tissue\nloss. The injury is assessed whether the bone and underly-ing tissue are intact and the size of the wound area. Thepulp is the area of skin opposite the fingernail and is usu-ally very vulnerable to injury. Pulp injuries commonlyoccur in persons who use or are in close contact with fastmoving mechanical devices. These injuries can crush, cut,and puncture. The fingertips can also be injured by com-mon crushing accidents. This could cause the develop-ment of a subungal hematoma (an accumulation of bloodunder the nail). At the base of the distal phalanx (the firstcircular skin fold from the tip) injuries can occur that canfracture the underlying bone in the area. Quite commonly\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1332Fingertip injuriesa hammer, closing a door, or sport accidents usually cause\nthese injuries. These fractures can be simple, requiring\nlittle treatment or more complicated involving the joint.The accident may involve the point of insertion of a ten-don. Usually this occurs when the terminal joint is beingforced to flex while held straight. This motion typicallyoccurs when tucking in sheets during bed making, a com-mon cause of tendon injury. This injury causes a loss ofextension (straightening the finger) ability.\nCauses and symptoms\nAccidental amputations will usually result in profuse\nbleeding and tissue loss. Injuries to the pulp can occur asfrom fast moving mechanical instruments, such as drills.These injuries may puncture the pulp. Injuries such as asubungal hematoma are caused by a crushing type injury.Fractures typically occur as the result of crushing injuriesor tendon avulsion. These crushing injuries are frequentlycaused during sport injury and can be treated by simpleinterventions such as immobilization or more complex\nprocedures if tendons are affected (the trauma is thentreated as a tendon injury). Fractures can cause pain and,\ndepending on the extent of swelling, there may be somerestriction of movement. Tendon injuries can be causedwhen the terminal joint is exposed to force flexing motion(moving the finger toward the palm) while held straight.\nDiagnosis\nThe attending clinician should evaluate the injury in\na careful and systematic manner. The appearance of thehand can provide valuable information concerning pres-ence of fractures, vascular status, and tendon involve-ment. Bones and joints should be evaluated for motionand tenderness. Nerves should be examined for sensory(feeling sensations) and motor (movement) functioning.Amputations usually profusely bleed and there is tissueloss. The wound is treated based on loss of tissue, bone,and wound area. Injuries to the pulp can be obvious dur-ing inspection. Subungal hematoma usually present apurplish-black discoloration under the nail. This is due toa hematoma underneath the nail. Radiographs may berequired to assess the alignment of fractures or detectforeign bodies. Patients usually suffer from pain sinceinjuries to the fingertip bone are usually painful andmovement may be partially restricted due to swelling ofthe affected area. Tendon injuries usually result in theloss of ability to straighten or bend the finger.\nTreatment\nAmputation with bone and underlying tissue intact\nand a wound area 1 cm or less should be cleaned andtreated with a dressing. With these types of woundsKEY TERMS\nDistal —Movement away from the origin.\nFlex—To bend.\nLaceration —A cut in the skin\nPhalanx —A bone of the fingers or toes.\nTendon —A structure that connects a skeletal mus-\ncle to bone.\nhealthy tissue will usually grow and replace the injured\narea. Larger wounds may require surgical intervention.Puncture wounds should be cleaned and left open to heal.Patients typically receive antibiotics to prevent infec-\ntion. A procedure called trephining treats subungalhematomas. This procedure is usually done with astraight cutting needle positioned over the nail. The clini-cian spins the needle with forefinger and thumb until ahole is made through the nail.\nPatients who have extensive crush injuries or subun-\ngal hematomas involving laceration to skin folds or naildamage should have the nail removed to examine theunderlying tissue (called the matrix). Patients who have aclosed subungal hematoma with an intact nail and noother damage (no nail disruption or laceration) are treat-ed conservatively. If the fracture is located two-thirdsbelow the fingertip immobilization using a splint may beneeded. Conservative treatment is recommended forcrush injuries that fracture the terminal phalanx if a sub-ungal hematoma is not present. Severe fractures near thefist circular skin crease may require surgical correctionto prevent irregularity of the joint surface, which cancause difficulty with movement. Injury to a flexor tendonusually requires surgical repair. If this is not possible, thefinger and wrist should be placed in a splint with specificpositioning to prevent further damage.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis depends on the extent of traumatic dam-\nage to the affected area. Nail lacerations that are nottreated may cause nail deformities. When amputation isaccompanied with loss of two-thirds of the nail, half ofthe fingers develop beaking, or a curved nail. Aftercareand follow up are important components of treatment.The patient is advised to keep the hand elevated, checkwith a clinician two days after treatment, and to splintfractures for two weeks in the extended position. Usuallya nail takes about 100 days to fully grow. Healing for anamputation takes about 21 to 27 days.

    "title": "Ciguatera",
    "content": "Ciguatera\nDefinition\nCiguatera (from the Spanish word for a poisonous\nsnail) is a food-related illness that causes abdominal andneurological symptoms.\nCauses and symptoms\nCiguatera is caused by eating fish that have a toxin\ncalled ciguatoxin. Scientists believe this toxin is acquiredby the fish through the food chain, and is originally pro-duced by small algae microorganisms (dinoflagellates).The fish most likely contaminated with ciguatoxin arethose that feed close to tropical reefs, including red snap-per, grouper, and barracuda. Larger fish are more likelyto contain the toxin. Although not as common in theUnited States, ciguatera is commonly diagnosed onmany of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.\nIllness from ciguatera can occur in just a few min-\nutes to about 30 hours after eating. Most cases occur oneto six hours after eating the contaminated fish. Initialsymptoms are abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, orwatery diarrhea . The most characteristic symptoms of\nthe illness are those involving the nervous system. Theseinclude numbness and tingling around the lips, tongue,\nand mouth; itching ; dry mouth ; metallic taste in the\nmouth; and blurry vision. In more prominent cases,patients may complain of temporary blindness, a slowpulse, and a feeling that their teeth are loose. Patientsmay also have the strange symptom of reversal of hot andcold sensations on the skin, where cold things feel veryhot or painful to the touch. In very severe cases, theremay be difficulties in breathing or low blood pressure.\nDiagnosis\nCiguatera diagnosis is based on the typical combina-\ntion of symptoms after eating fish. There are no readilyavailable blood or urine tests to detect the poisoning, butsome researchers have developed a test for the toxin lefton any remaining fish. A person does not have to be in atropical area to get ciguatera. Fish can be caught fromone of these distant areas, and can then be shipped andeaten locally. It is important to report suspected cases tolocal public health officials because more cases mayoccur from other contaminated fish.\nTreatment\nThe treatment for this illness is general. Patients are\ngiven fluids (by mouth or through a vein) and medica-tions to decrease the itching or to treat vomiting and/ordiarrhea. The neurological symptoms can cause discom-fort and treatment with amitriptyline (a medicine that hasbeen used for depression) may be useful. Other medica-tions may also be given.\nPrognosis\nAlthough death can occur, almost all patients diag-\nnosed with ciguatera will recover. Recovery, however,can be slow and some symptoms can last for weeks oreven months. Symptoms can also be aggravated by otherillnesses or alcohol.\nPrevention\nKnowing the kinds of fish linked to ciguatera can\nhelp a person avoid eating high-risk fish. However, over400 different kinds of fish have been linked to the dis-ease, even salmon. A particular fish in a given area maybe more likely to cause ciguatera than other fish. Forexample, red snapper is most often the source of ciguat-era in the Pacific, while barracuda is more likely to con-tain the toxin in Florida. This is why it is illegal to sellbarracuda in Florida for human consumption. Cookingthe fish does not prevent ciguatera.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1334Fish and shellfish poisoningScombroid\nDefinition\nScombroid is a fish-associated illness caused by eat-\ning improperly handled fish. Fish linked to this diseaseare usually in the Scombridae family, which includes yel-lowfin tuna, skipjack, bonito, and mackerel.\nCauses and symptoms\nScombroid occurs after eating fish that has not\nbeen properly refrigerated after capture. Unlike ciguat-era, the toxins linked with scombroid are not contractedby the fish from its surroundings. Bacteria that are nor-mally found in fish act directly on a chemical (calledhistidine) in the flesh of fish that are not properlycooled when stored. This interaction produces hista-mine and other chemicals that cause the illness whenthe fish is eaten.\nSymptoms of scombroid occur quickly after eating\nthe fish, as soon as 10 minutes. Since histamine isreleased by certain cells in the body during an allergicreaction, scombroid can be confused with a fish allergy.Scombroid causes flushing of the face, sweating, a burn-ing feeling in the mouth or throat, vomiting, diarrhea,and headaches. A rash that looks like a sunburn may\noccur, and a small number of patients have hives . Some\npatients have a metallic or peppery taste in their mouths.In more severe cases, rapid pulse, blurred vision, and dif-ficulty breathing can occur. Symptoms usually last aboutfour hours.\nDiagnosis\nLike ciguatera, scombroid poisoning is diagnosed\nbased on typical symptoms occurring after eating fish.There are usually no available tests for the patient.Experimentally, however, elevated levels of histamine-related products have been found in the urine. It maybe possible for public health officials to test anyremaining fish flesh for histamine levels. Improperlyrefrigerated fish caught in both temperate and tropicalwaters have been linked to the illness. An outbreak ofsimilar cases may be helpful in correctly diagnosingthe problem.\nTreatment\nThe treatment for scombroid is usually general.\nAntihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may\nshorten the duration of the illness, but the illness will goaway on its own. Some doctors have found that cimeti-dine (Tagamet) given through a vein may be helpful aswell. In rare, more severe cases, epinephrine (adrenaline)may be used.KEY TERMS\nAlgae —Plants that have one cell.\nHistamine —A chemical found naturally in the\nbody that produces inflammation and increasesblood flow; the uncomfortable symptoms of anallergy attack or an allergic reaction are generallycaused by the release of histamine.\nToxin —A poisonous substance usually produced\nby a living thing.\nPrognosis\nAlthough sometimes dramatic and alarming symptoms\ncan occur, scombroid is usually not serious. The patientshould be reassured that scombroid is not a fish allergy.\nPrevention\nAdequate storage of the target fish will always pre-\nvent scombroid. Since the fish does not appear spoiled orsmell bad, the consumer cannot detect the risk of the ill-ness before eating the fish. Cooking the fish does not pre-vent scombroid. Suspected cases should be reported topublic health officials."

    "title": "Paralytic shellfish poisoning",
    "content": "Paralytic shellfish poisoning\nDefinition\nParalytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a nervous system\ndisease caused by eating cooked or raw shellfish that con-tain environmental toxins. These toxins are produced by agroup of algae (dinoflagellates). It is unclear whether thesetoxins are related to the “blooming” of the algae, alsocalled red tide because the algae can turn the water reddishbrown. PSP occurs mostly in May through November.\nCauses and symptoms\nPSP develops usually within minutes after eating a\ncontaminated shellfish, most commonly a mussel, clam,or oyster. Symptoms include headache , a floating feel-\ning,dizziness , lack of coordination, and tingling of the\nmouth, arms, or legs. Muscle weakness causing difficultyswallowing or speaking may occur. Abdominal symptomssuch as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can also occur.Unlike ciguatera and scombroid, PSP may have a muchmore serious outcome. PSP may cause difficulty breath-ing related to weakness or paralysis of the breathing\nmuscle. The symptoms may last for six to 12 hours, but apatient may continue to feel weak for a week or more.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1335Fish and shellfish poisoningDiagnosis\nPSP diagnosis is based on symptoms after eating\nshellfish, even if the shellfish are adequately cooked. Noblood or urine test is available to diagnose the illness, buttests in mice to detect the toxin from the eaten fish can bedone by public health officials.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of PSP is mostly supportive. If early\nsymptoms are recognized, the doctor will try to flush thetoxin from the gastrointestinal tract with medications thatcreate diarrhea. V omiting may be induced if the patienthas no signs of weakness. In cases where the muscles ofbreathing are weakened, the patient may be placed on arespirator until the weakness goes away. However, thismeasure is not usually needed. Likewise, the use of amachine to clean the blood (dialysis) has been used insevere cases.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for PSP is quite good, especially if\nthe patient has passed the initial 12 hours of illness with-out needing breathing support. Most deaths occur duringthis period if breathing help is not available.\nPrevention\nMeasures to control PSP require detecting rising\nnumbers of algae in coastal waters by periodic micro-scopic examination. By law, shellfish beds are closedwhen levels of the toxin-producing organisms are aboveacceptable standards. Cooking the shellfish does not pre-vent this disease. Suspected cases should be reported topublic health officials.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nBarton, Erik D., Paula Tanner, Steven G.

This tissue death , called\nnecrosis or gangrene , spreads rapidly. This disease can\nbe fatal in as little as 12 to 24 hours.\nDescription\nAlthough the term is technically incorrect, flesh-eat-\ning disease is an apt descriptor: the infection appears todevour body tissue. Media reports increased in the mid-dle and late 1990s, but the disease is not new. Hip-pocrates described it more than three millennia ago andthousands of reports exist from the Civil War. Approxi-mately 500 to 1,500 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occurin the United States each year.\nFlesh-eating disease is divided into two types. Type I\nis caused by anaerobic bacteria, with or without the pres-ence of aerobic bacteria. Type II, also called hemolyticstreptococcal gangrene, is caused by group A streptococ-ci; other bacteria may or may not be present. The diseasemay also be called synergistic gangrene.\nType I fasciitis typically affects the trunk, abdomen,\nand genital area. For example, Fournier’s gangrene is a“flesh-eating” disease in which the infection encompass-es the external genitalia. The arms and legs are mostoften affected in type II fasciitis, but the infection mayappear anywhere.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe two most important factors in determining\nwhether or not a person will develop flesh-eating diseaseare: the virulence (ability to cause disease) of the bacteriaand the susceptibility (ability of a person’s immune sys-tem to respond to infection) of the person who becomesinfected with this bacteria.\nIn nearly every case of flesh-eating disease, a skin\ninjury precedes the disease. As bacteria grow beneath theskin’s surface, they produce toxins. These toxins destroysuperficial fascia, subcutaneous fat, and deep fascia. Insome cases, the overlying dermis and the underlyingmuscle are also affected.\nInitially, the infected area appears red and swollen\nand feels hot. The area is extremely painful, which is aprominent feature of the disease. Over the course ofhours or days, the skin may become blue-gray, and fluid-filled blisters may form. As nerves are destroyed the area\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1336Flesh-eating diseasebecomes numb. An individual may go into shock and\ndevelop dangerously low blood pressure. Multiple organfailure may occur, quickly followed by death.\nDiagnosis\nThe appearance of the skin, paired with pain and\nfever raises the possibility of flesh-eating disease. An x\nray,magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed\ntomography scans (CT scans) of the area reveals a\nfeathery pattern in the tissue, caused by accumulatinggas in the dying tissue. Necrosis is evident duringexploratory surgery, during which samples are collectedfor bacterial identification.\nTreatment\nRapid, aggressive medical treatment, specifically,\nantibiotic therapy and surgical debridement , is impera-\ntive. Antibiotics may include penicillin, an aminoglyco-\nside or third-generation cephalosporin, and clindamycinor metronidazole. Analgesics are employed for pain con-\ntrol. During surgical debridement, dead tissue is strippedaway. After surgery, patients are rigorously monitored forcontinued infection, shock, or other complications. Ifavailable, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also be used.\nPrognosis\nFlesh-eating disease has a fatality rate of about 30%.\nDiabetes, arteriosclerosis, immunosuppression, kidneydisease, malnutrition , and obesity are connected with a\npoor prognosis. Older individuals and intravenous drugusers may also be at higher risk. The infection site alsohas a role. Survivors may require plastic surgery and mayhave to contend with permanent physical disability andpsychological adjustment.\nPrevention\nFlesh-eating disease, which occurs very rarely, can-\nnot be definitively prevented. The best ways to lower therisk of contracting flesh-eating disease are:\n• take care to avoid any injury to the skin that may give\nthe bacteria a place of entry\n• when skin injuries do occur, they should be promptly\nwashed and treated with an antibiotic ointment or spray\n• people who have any skin injury should rigorously\nattempt to avoid people who are infected with streptococ-ci bacteria.

    "title": "Flower remedies",
    "content": "Flower remedies\nDefinition\nFlower remedies are specially prepared flower\nessences, containing the healing energy of plants. Theyare prescribed according to a patient’s emotional disposi-tion, as ascertained by the therapist, doctor, or patientsthemselves.\nPurpose\nFlower remedies are more homeopathic than herbal\nin the way they work, effecting energy levels rather thanchemical balances. They have been described as “liquidenergy.” The theory is that they encapsulate the flowers’healing energy, and are said to deal with and overcomenegative emotions, and so relieve blockages in the flowof human energy that can cause illness.\nDescription\nOrigins\nPerhaps the most famous and widely used system is\nthe Bach flower remedies. This system originated in the1920s when British physician and bacteriologist, Dr.Edward Bach (1886–1936), noticed that patients withphysical complaints often seemed to be suffering fromanxiety or some kind of negative emotion. He concluded\nthat assessing a patient’s emotional disposition and pre-scribing an appropriate flower essence could treat thephysical illness. Bach was a qualified medical doctor, buthe also practiced homeopathy .\nAs a result of his own serious illness in 1917, Bach\nbegan a search for a new and simple system of medicinethat would treat the whole person. In 1930, he gave up hisflourishing practice on Harley Street at the Royal LondonHomeopathic Hospital and moved to the countryside todevote his life to this research. It is known that at thispoint, he ceased to dispense the mixture of homeopathyand allopathic medicine that he had been using. Instead, hebegan investigating the healing properties of plantessences and discovered that he possessed an “intuition”for judging the properties of each flower. Accordingly, hedeveloped the system of treatment that bears his name, andis also the foundation for all other flower-remedy systems.\nThe Bach Flower Remedies were ostensibly the only\nsystem of significance from the 1920s until in the 1970s,when there was a renewed interest in the subject by doc-tors working in the field of natural medicine. Perhaps themost notable was Dr. Richard Katz, who was seeking newmethods of dealing with modern stress and the resulting\nailments. He focused on the concept of a psychic, psycho-logical effect and chose to pursue this line of research.\nIn 1979, Katz founded the Flower Essence Society\nin California, (FES). This society pledged to further theresearch and development of Bach’s principles. As of2000, FES hosts a database of over 100 flower essencesfrom more than 50 countries. FES is now an internationalorganization of health practitioners, researchers, stu-dents, and others concerned with flower essence therapy.\nThe Society has connections with an estimated\n50,000 active practitioners from around the world, whouse flower essence therapy as part of their treatment. FESencourages the study of the plants themselves to deter-mine the characteristics of flower essences. They arecompiling an extensive database of case studies and prac-titioner reports of the use of essences therapeutically,allowing verification and development of the originaldefinitions. They are also engaged in the scientific studyof flower essence therapy.\nFES says they have developed the theories of Paracel-\nsus and Goethe who researched the “signatures” and “ges-tures” of botanical specimens, on the premise that thehuman body and soul are a reflection of the system ofnature. FES plant research interprets the therapeutic prop-erties of flower essences according to these insights.\nIn this regard, they have devised 12 “windows of\nperception” for monitoring the attributes of plants. Eachof these windows reveals an aspect of the plant’s quali-ties, although they maintain that what they are seeking isa “whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.” The12 windows are not considered independent classifica-tions, but more of a blended tapestry of views of thequalities that each plant possesses.\nThe first window is concerned with the “form” of a\nplant—its shape classification. The second focuses on its“gesture” or spatial relationship. The third window is aplant’s botanical classification; the Flower Essence Soci-ety maintains that considering a plant’s botanical family\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1338Flower remediesis essential to obtaining an overview of its properties as a\nflower essence. The fourth window concerns the time ori-entation of a particular specimen regarding the daily andseasonal cycles. Why do some flowers bloom at differenttimes of the day, while others, such as the evening prim-rose, respond to the moon? The fifth window observes aplant’s relationship to its environment. Where a plantchooses to grow, and where it cannot survive, revealsmuch about its qualities. The sixth window observes aplant’s relationship to the Four Elements and the FourEthers, as FES maintains that plants exist in one of theelemental or etheric forces in addition to their physicallife. “Elements” refers to those developed by the Greeks,as opposed to the modern concept of “molecular buildingblocks.” It seems that commonly, two elements predomi-nate in a plant, indicating a polarity of qualities, whiletwo can be said to be recessive. The seventh windowrelates to a plant’s relationship with the other kingdoms ofnature: mineral, animal and human, while the eighthrelates to the color and color variations of a plant. Katzexplains how the language of color tells us so much aboutthe “soul qualities” of a plant. The ninth window concernsall other sensory perceptions of a plant, such as fragrance,texture, and taste. The tenth window involves assessingthe chemical substances and properties; the eleventh stud-ies medicinal and herbal uses, as by studying the physicalhealing properties of plants, we can also understandsomething of their more subtle effects on the soul. Finally,the twelfth window involves the study of the lore, mythol-ogy, folk wisdom, and spiritual and ritual qualities associ-ated with a particular plant. Katz relates how in the past,human beings were more in touch with the natural world,and the remnants of this unconscious plant wisdom liveon in the form of folklore, mythology, and so on.\nBecause flower remedies operate on approximately\nthe same principles as homeopathy, practitioners quiteoften prescribe the two therapies in conjunction witheach other. They can also be used concurrently with allo-pathic medicine.\nThe system consists of 38 remedies, each for a dif-\nferent disposition. The basic theory is that if the remedyfor the correct disposition is chosen, the physical illnessresulting from the present emotional state can then becured. There is a rescue remedy made up of five of theessences—cherry plum, clematis, impatiens, rock star,and star of Bethlehem—that is recommended for thetreatment of any kind of physical or emotional shock.Therapists recommended that rescue remedy be kept onhand to help with all emergencies.\nThe 38 Bach Remedies\n• agrimony: puts on a cheerful front, hides true feelings,\nand worries or problemsEDWARD BACH (1886–1936)\nEdward Bach was a graduate of University College\nHospital (M.B., B.S., M.R.C.S.) in England. He left hisflourishing Harley Street practice in favor of homeopa-thy, seeking a more natural system of healing than allo-pathic medicine. He concluded that healing should beas simple and natural as the development of plants,which were nourished and given healing properties byearth, air, water, and sun.\nBach believed that he could sense the individual\nhealing properties of flowers by placing his hands overthe petals. His remedies were prepared by floating sum-mer flowers in a bowl of clear stream water exposed tosunlight for three hours.\nHe developed 38 remedies, one for each of the\nnegative states of mind suffered by human beings,which he classified under seven group headings: fear,uncertainty, insufficient interest in present circum-stances, loneliness, over-sensitivity to influences andideas, despondency or despair, and overcare for thewelfare of others. The Bach remedies can be prescribedfor plants, animals, and other living creatures as well ashuman beings.\n• aspen: feelings of apprehension, dark foreboding, and\npremonitions\n• beech: critical, intolerant, picky\n• centaury: easily comes under the influence of others,\nweak willed\n• cerato: unsure, no confidence in own judgement, intu-\nition, and seeks approval from others\n• cherry plum: phobic, fear of being out of control, and\ntension\n• chestnut bud: repeats mistakes, does not learn from\nexperience\n• chicory: self–centered, possessive, clingy, demanding,\nself pity\n• clematis: absent minded, dreamy, apathetic, and lack of\nconnection with reality\n• crab apple: a “cleanser” for prudishness, self–disgust,\nfeeling unclean\n• elm: a sense of being temporarily overwhelmed in peo-\nple who are usually capable and in control\n• gentian: discouraged, doubting, despondent• gorse: feelings of pessimism, accepting defeat\n• heather: need for company, talks about self, and con-\ncentrates on own problems\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1339Flower remedies• holly: jealousy, envy, suspicion, anger, and hatred\n• honeysuckle: reluctance to enter the present and let the\npast go\n• hornbeam: reluctant to face a new day, weary, can’t\ncope (mental fatigue)\n• impatiens: impatience, always in a hurry, and resentful\nof constraints\n• larch: feelings of inadequacy and apprehension, lack of\nconfidence and will to succeed\n• mimulus: fearful of specific things, shy, and timid\n• mustard: beset by “dark cloud” and gloom for no appar-\nent reason\n• oak: courageous, persevering, naturally strong but tem-\nporarily overcome by difficulties\n• olive: for physical and mental renewal, to overcome\nexhaustion from problems of long–standing\n• pine: for self–reproach, always apologizing, assuming\nguilt\n• red chestnut: constant worry and concern for others\n• rock rose: panic, intense alarm, dread, horror\n• rock water: rigid–minded, self–denial, restriction• scleranthus: indecision, uncertainty, fluctuating moods\n• star of Bethlehem: consoling, following shock or grief\nor serious news\n• sweet chestnut: desolation, despair, bleak outlook• vervain: insistent, fanatical, over–enthusiastic\n• vine: dominating, overbearing, autocratic, tyrannical\n• walnut: protects during a period of adjustment or vul-\nnerability\n• water violet: proud, aloof, reserved, enjoys being alone• white chestnut: preoccupation with worry, unwanted\nthoughts\n• wild oat: drifting, lack of direction in life\n• wild rose: apathy, resignation, no point in life• willow bitter: resentful, dissatisfied, feeling life is unfair\nOriginally, Bach collected the dew from chosen\nflowers by hand to provide his patients with the requiredremedy. This became impractical when his treatmentbecame so popular that production could not keep upwith demand. He then set about finding a way to manu-facture the remedies, and found that floating the freshlypicked petals on the surface of spring water in a glassbowl and leaving them in strong sunlight for three hoursproduced the desired effect. Therapists explain that thewater is “potentized” by the essence of the flowers. Thepotentized water can then be bottled and sold. For morewoody specimens, the procedure is to boil them in a ster-ilized pan of water for 30 minutes. These two methodsproduce “mother tinctures” and the same two methods\ndevised by Bach are still used today. Flower essences donot contain any artificial chemical substances, except foralcohol preservative.\nBach remedies cost around $10 each, and there is no\nset time limit for treatment. It may take days, weeks, or insome cases months. Flower essences cost around $6 each,and there is also no set time for the length of treatment, orthe amount of essences that may be taken. These treat-ments are not generally covered by medical insurance.\nPrecautions\nBach remedies and flower essences are not difficult\nto understand, and are considered suitable for self admin-istration.

An important aspect oftreatment with flower remedies, is that if you feel instinc-tively that you need a particular remedy, you are encour-aged to act on that instinct. However, it is advisable notto continue a particular remedy once you feel you nolonger need it, and to try a different one if you feel thatprogress is not being made.\nThe remedies are administered from a stoppered\nbottle and need to be diluted. Individuals sensitive toalcohol can apply the concentrate directly to temples,wrists, behind the ears, or underarms. They should bekept in a cool dark place; like this they should last indef-initely. However, a diluted remedy should not be keptlonger than three weeks. Two drops of each diluted rem-edy should be taken four times a day, including firstthing in the morning and last thing at night. If the rescueremedy is being used, four drops should be used instead.Most therapists recommend that they be taken in springwater, but the remedy can be taken directly from the bot-tle, if care is taken that the dropper does not touch thetongue, as this would introduce bacteria that would spoilthe remedy.\nIt is not recommended that more than six or seven\nBach remedies be used at any one time. Instead, it ispreferable to divide a larger amount up into two lots toensure the optimum effectiveness of the remedies. Nocombination, or amount of combinations of the remediescan cause any harm, rather they become less effective.\nUnlike FES, the Bach Centre does not encourage\nresearch to “prove” that the remedies work, preferringthat people find out for themselves. They strive to keepthe use of the Bach remedies as simple as possible, andto this end they do not keep case records. Bach warnedbefore he died that others would try to change his workand make it more complicated. He was determined tokeep it simple so that anyone could use it, and that is whyhe limited the system to only 38 remedies. The Centrepoints out that many who have used Bach’s research as astarting point have added other remedies to the list, evensome that Bach himself rejected.\nSide effects\nFlower remedies or essences are generally regarded as\nbeing totally safe, and there are no known side effects apartfrom the rare appearance of a slight rash, which is not a rea-son to discontinue treatment, says the Bach Centre.\nResearch and general acceptance\nBach flower remedies and flower essences have not yet\nofficially won the support of allopathic medicine, despitethe fact that more and more medical doctors are referringKEY TERMS\nAura —Emanation of light from living things\n(plants and animals) that can be recorded by Kir-lian photography.\nEssence —The constituent of a plant that deter-\nmines its characteristics.\nPotentize —The process of transferring the healing\nenergy of a plant into spring water.\nWindow —A perspective adopted to assess the\nproperty of a given plant.\npatients for such treatments on the strength of personal con-\nviction.

    "title": "Fluke infections",
    "content": "Fluke infections\nDefinition\nFluke infections are diseases of the digestive tract\nand other organ systems caused by several different\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1341Fluke infectionsspecies of parasitic flatworms (Trematodes) that have\ncomplex life cycles involving hosts other than humanbeings. Trematode comes from a Greek word that meanshaving holes and refers to the external suckers that adultflukes use to draw nourishment from their hosts. Flukeinfections are contracted by eating uncooked fish, plants,or animals from fluke-infected waters. Symptoms varyaccording to the type of fluke infection.\nDescription\nIn humans, fluke infections can be classified accord-\ning to those diseases caused by liver flukes and thosecaused by lung flukes. Diseases caused by liver flukesinclude fascioliasis, opisthorchiasis, and clonorchiasis.Cases of liver fluke infection have been reported in Europeand the United States, as well as the Middle East, China,Japan, and Africa. Diseases caused by lung flukes includeparagonimiasis. Paragonimiasis is a common infection inthe Far East, Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and SouthAmerica, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. It is estimatedthat between 40 million and 100 million people worldwidesuffer from either liver or lung fluke infections.\nIn their adult stage, liver and lung flukes are sym-\nmetrical in shape, ranging between 1/4–1 in in length,and look somewhat like long, plump leaves or blades ofgrass. They enter through the mouth and can infect anyperson at any age.Causes and symptoms\nThe symptoms of fluke infection differ somewhat\naccording to the type of fluke involved. All forms of liverand lung fluke infection, however, have the followingcharacteristics:\n• most persons who get infected do not develop symp-\ntoms (asymptomatic)\n• the early symptoms of an acute fluke infection are not\nunique to these diseases alone (nonspecific symptoms)\n• infection does not confer immunity against re-infection\nby the same species or infection by other species offlukes\n• infection is usually associated with eating uncooked\nfish, plants, or animals that live in fresh water\nFascioliasis\nFascioliasis is caused by Fasciola hepatica , the\nsheep liver fluke. The fluke has a three-part life cycle thatbegins when eggs from a host’s feces are deposited inwater. The eggs release free-swimming larvae(miracidia) that infect snails. The snails then release free-swimming larvae with tails (cercariae) that form cystscontaining larvae in the infective stage (metacercariae)on vegetation growing in fresh water. Humans becomeinfected when they eat watercress, water chestnuts, orother plants covered with the encysted metacercariae.\nWhen a person eats contaminated plants, the cysts\nare broken open in the digestive system, and the metacer-cariae leave their cysts, pass through the wall of theintestine, and enter the liver, where they cause inflamma-tion and destroy tissue. After a period of 10–15 weeks inthe liver, the adult flukes move to the bile ducts and pro-duce eggs. Acute fascioliasis is marked by abdominalpain with headache , loss of appetite, anemia, and vomit-\ning. Some patients develop hives , muscle pains, or a yel-\nlow-color to the skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice ).\nChronic forms of the disease may produce complica-tions, including blockage of the bile ducts or the migra-tion of adult flukes to other parts of the body.\nOpisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis\nThese infections are caused by Clonorchis sinensis ,\nthe Chinese liver fluke, and Opisthorchis viverrini or O.\nfelineus . The diseases are widespread, affecting more\nthan 20 million people in Japan, China, Southeast Asia,and India. The life cycle of these liver flukes is similar tothat of F . hepatica except that the etacercariae are encyst-\ned in freshwater fish rather than on plants. Dogs, cats,and other mammals that eat raw fish can be infected withopisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1342Fluke infections\nA micrograph of adult intestinal blood flukes, Schistosoma\nmansoni. Humans can become infected while bathing or\nworking in contaminated water. (Photo Researchers, Inc.\nReproduced by permission.)The symptoms of opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis are\nsimilar to those of fascioliasis and include both acute andchronic forms. In acute infection, the patient may be tired,have a low-grade fever , pains in the joints, a swollen liver,\nabdominal pain, and a skin rash. The acute syndrome maybe difficult to diagnose because the fluke eggs do not appearin the patient’s stool for three to four weeks after infection.Patients with the chronic form of the disease experience aloss of appetite, fatigue , low-grade fever, diarrhea , and an\nenlarged liver that feels sore when the abdomen is pressed.\nParagonimiasis\nParagonimiasis is caused by a lung fluke, either\nParagonimus westermani or P . skrjabini . These flukes are\nlarger than liver flukes and infect meat- or fish-eating ani-mals as well as humans. Their life cycle is similar to thatof liver flukes except that their encysted larvae infect crabsand crayfish rather than plants or fish. Humans can ingestthe encysted metacercariae from drinking contaminatedwater or eating raw or undercooked crabs and crayfish.\nIn humans, the metacercariae are released from their\ncysts in the small intestine and migrate to the lungs or thebrain in 1% of cases. In the lungs, the flukes lay theireggs and form areas of inflammation covered with a thinlayer of fibrous tissue. These areas of infection mayeventually rupture, causing the patient to cough up fluke\neggs, blood, and inflamed tissue.

Patients with lunginfections may have chest pain and fever as well as rust-colored or bloody sputum. Lung infections can lead tolung abscess ,pneumonia , or bronchitis . Patients with\nfluke infections of the brain may experience seizures or afatal inflammation of brain tissue called encephalitis .\nSome patients also develop diarrhea and abdominal painor lumps under the skin that contain adult flukes.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of fluke infections is based on a combina-\ntion of the patient’s history, particularly travel or resi-dence in areas known to have flukes, and identification ofthe fluke’s eggs or adult forms. In some patients, the eggsare found in fluid from the lungs, bile duct, or smallintestine. Samples of these fluids can be obtained with asuction instrument (aspirator). Because most types offluke infections are rare in the United States, stool speci-mens or body fluid samples may need to be sent to a lab-oratory with experts in unusual diseases or conditions toidentify the specific parasite. In some cases, adult flukesmay be found in the patient’s stools, vomit, sputum, orskin lumps (for lung flukes). In the case of lung flukes, itis important for the doctor to rule out tuberculosis as a\npossible diagnosis. A tuberculosis skin test and chest x\nraywill usually be sufficient to do this.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1343Fluke infectionsBlood tests may be useful in diagnosing fluke\ninfections, but their usefulness is limited because ofcross-reactions. A cross-reaction occurs in blood testingwhen a particular disease agent reacts with antibodiesspecific to another disease agent. This result means thatthe doctor may know that the person is infected byflukes but cannot tell from the blood test alone whichspecific type of fluke is causing the disease. In addition,blood tests for fluke infections cannot distinguishbetween past and current infections. In some cases,sophisticated imaging techniques, such as computed\ntomography scans (CT scans) or ultrasound scans of\nthe patient’s chest or brain (for lung flukes) or abdomen(for liver flukes), are useful in confirming a diagnosisof fluke infection.\nTreatment\nLiver and lung fluke infections are treated with med-\nications. These include triclabendazole, praziquantel,bithionol, albendazole, and mebendazole. Praziquantelworks by paralyzing the flukes’ suckers, forcing them todrop away from the walls of the host’s blood vessels. Inthe United States, bithionol is available only from theCenters for Disease Control (CDC). Depending on thespecies of fluke and the severity of infection, the courseof treatment can vary from several days to several weeks.Cure rates vary from 50–95%. Most patients experiencemild temporary side effects from these drugs, includingdiarrhea, dizziness , or headache.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from liver fluke infec-\ntions is good, although patients with serious infectionsmay be more vulnerable to other diseases, particularly ifsignificant liver damage has occurred. Most patients withlung fluke infections also recover, however, severe infec-tions of the brain can cause death from the destruction of\ncentral nervous system or brain tissue.\nPrevention\nNo vaccines have been developed that are effective\nagainst lung or liver fluke infections. Prevention of theseinfections includes the following measures:\n• boiling or purifying drinking water• avoiding raw or undercooked fish or salads made from\nfresh aquatic plants; all food eaten in areas with flukeinfestations should be cooked thoroughly; pickling orsmoking will not kill fluke cysts in fish or shellfish\n• control or eradication of the snails that serve as the\nflukes’ intermediate hostsResources\nBOOKS\nGoldsmith, Robert S. “Infectious Diseases: Protozoal &\nHelminthic.” Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment,\n1998. 37th ed.

Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-scription for the correct dosage.\nTo make sure the infection clears up completely,\ntake the medicine for as long as it has been prescribed.Do not stop taking the drug just because symptoms beginto improve. Symptoms may return if the drug is stoppedtoo soon.\nFluoroquinolones work best when they are at con-\nstant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant,take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the dayand night. Do not miss any doses. For best results, takethis medicine with a full glass of water and drink severalmore glasses throughout the day, every day during treat-ment with the drug. The extra water will help preventsome side effects. Some fluoroquinolones should betaken on an empty stomach; others may be taken withmeals. Check package directions or ask the physician orpharmacist for instructions on how to take the medicine.\nPrecautions\nResearch suggests that fluoroquinolones may cause\nbone development problems in children and teenagers.Infants, children, teenagers, pregnant women, andwomen who are breastfeeding should not take this medi-cine unless directed to do so by a physician.\nAlthough such side effects are rare, some people\nhave had severe and life-threatening reactions to fluoro-quinolones.

    "title": "Folic acid",
    "content": "Folic acid\nDefinition\nFolic acid is a water-soluable vitamin belonging to the\nB-complex group of vitamins . These vitamins help the\nbody break down complex carbohydrates into simple sug-ars to be used for energy. Excess B vitamins are excretedfrom the body rather than stored for later use. This is whysufficient daily intake of folic acid is necessary.\nDescription\nFolic acid is also known as folate, or folacin. It is\none of the nutrients most often found to be deficient inthe Western diet, and there is evidence that deficiency isa problem on a worldwide scale. Folic acid is found inleafy green vegetables, beans, peas and lentils, liver,beets, brussel sprouts, poultry, nutritional yeast, tuna,wheat germ, mushrooms, oranges, asparagus, broccoli,spinach, bananas, strawberries, and cantaloupes. In 1998,the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requiredfood manufacturers to add folic acid to enriched breadand grain products to boost intake and to help preventneural tube defects (NTD).\nPurpose\nFolic acid works together with vitamin B12and vita-\nmin C to metabolize protein in the body. It is importantfor the formation of red and white blood cells. It is neces-sary for the proper differentiation and growth of cells andfor the development of the fetus. It is also used to formthe nucleic acid of DNA and RNA. It increases theappetite and stimulates the production of stomach acidfor digestion and it aids in maintaining a healthy liver. Adeficiency of folic acid may lead to anemia, in whichthere is decreased production of red blood cells. Thisreduces the amounts of oxygen and nutrients that are ableto get to the tissues. Symptoms may include fatigue ,\nreduced secretion of digestive acids, confusion, and for-getfulness. During pregnancy , a folic acid deficiency\nmay lead to preeclampsia, premature birth, and increasedbleeding after birth.\nPeople who are at high risk of strokes and heart dis-\nease may greatly benefit by taking folic acid supple-ments. An elevated blood level of the amino acid homo-cysteine has been identified as a risk factor for some ofthese diseases. High levels of homocysteine have alsobeen found to contribute to problems with osteoporosis .\nFolic acid, together with vitamins B\n6and B12, helps break\ndown homocysteine, and may help reverse the problemsassociated with elevated levels.\nPregnant women have an increased need for folic\nacid, both for themselves and their child. Folic acid isnecessary for the proper growth and development of thefetus. Adequate intake of folic acid is vital for the pre-vention of several types of birth defects , particularly\nNTDs. The neural tube of the embryo develops into thebrain, spinal cord, spinal column, and the skull. If thistube forms incompletely during the first few months ofpregnancy a serious, and often fatal, defect results inspina bifida or anencephaly. Folic acid, taken from one\nyear to one month before conception through the firstfour months of pregnancy, can reduce the risk of NTDsby 50–70%. It also helps prevent a cleft lip and palate .\nResearch shows that folic acid can be used to suc-\ncessfully treat cervical dysplasia, a condition diagnosedby a Pap smear, of having abnormal cells in the cervix.This condition is considered to be a possible precursor tocervical cancer , and is diagnosed as an abnormal Pap\nsmear. Daily consumption of 1,000 mcg of folic acid forthree or more months has resulted in improved cervicalcells upon repeat Pap smears.\nStudies suggest that long-term use of folic acid sup-\nplements may also help prevent lung and colon cancer .\nResearchers have also found that alcoholics who havelow folic acid levels face a greatly increased possibilityof developing colon cancer .\nPreparations\nTo correct a folic acid deficiency, supplements are\ntaken in addition to food. Since the functioning of the Bvitamins is interrelated, it is generally recommended thatthe appropriate dose of B-complex vitamins be taken inplace of single B vitamin supplements. The Recom-mended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for folate is 400 mcgper day for adults, 600 mcg per day for pregnant women,and 500 mcg for nursing women. Medicinal dosages ofup to 1,000-2,000 mcg per day may be prescribed.\nPrecautions\nFolic acid is not stable. It is easily destroyed by\nexposure to light, air, water, and cooking. Therefore, thesupplement should be stored in a dark container in acold, dry place, such as a refrigerator. Many medicationsinterfere with the body’s absorption and use of folic acid.This includes sulfa drugs, sleeping pills, estrogen, anti-convulsants, birth control pills, antacids , quinine, and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1347Folic acidsome antibiotics . Using large amounts of folic acid (e.g.,\nover 5,000 mcg per day) can mask a vitamin B12deficien-\ncy and thereby risk of irreversible nerve damage.\nSide effects\nAt levels of 5,000 mcg or less, folic acid is generally\nsafe for use. Side effects are uncommon. However, largedoses may cause nausea, decreased appetite, bloating,gas, decreased ability to concentrate, and insomnia .\nLarge doses may also decrease the effects of phenytoin(Dilantin), a seizure medication.\nInteractions\nAs with all B-complex vitamins, it is best to take\nfolic acid with the other B vitamins. Vitamin C is impor-tant to the absorption and functioning of folic acid in thebody.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBraverman, Eric R., M.D., Carl C.

    "content": "Folic acid deficiency anemia\nDefinition\nFolic acid deficiency, an abnormally low level of\none of the B vitamins , results in anemia characterized by\nred blood cells that are large in size but few in number.\nDescription\nFolic acid is necessary for growth and cellular\nrepair, since it is a critical component of DNA and RNAas well as essential for the formation and maturation ofred blood cells. Folic acid deficiency is one of the mostcommon of all vitamin deficiencies. Although it occursin both males and females, folic acid deficiency anemiamost often affects women over 30. It becomes increas-ingly common as age impedes the body’s ability toabsorb folic acid, a water-soluble vitamin that is manu-factured by intestinal bacteria and stored for a short timein the liver. Folic acid deficiency has also been implicat-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1348Folic acid deficiency anemiaed as a cause of neural tube defects in the developing\nfetus. Recent research has shown that adequate amountsof folic acid can prevent up to half of these birth defects ,\nif women start taking folic acid supplements shortlybefore conception.\nA healthy adult needs at least 400 mcg of folic acid\nevery day. Requirements at least double during pregnan-\ncy, and increase by 50% when a woman is breastfeeding.\nThe average American diet, high in fats, sugar, and whiteflour, provides about 200 mcg of folic acid, approximate-ly the amount needed to maintain tissue stores of the sub-stance for six to nine months before a deficiency devel-ops. Most of the folic acid in foods (with the exception ofthe folic acid added to enriched flour and breakfast cere-als) occurs as folate. Folate is only about half as availablefor the body to use as is the folic acid in pills and supple-ments. Folate also is easily destroyed by sunlight, over-cooking, or the storing of foods at room temperature foran extended period of time.\nGood dietary sources of folate include:\n• leafy green vegetables•l i v e r\n• mushrooms\n• oatmeal• peanut butter\n• red beans\n•s o y• wheat germ\nCauses and symptoms\nThis condition usually results from a diet lacking in\nfoods with high folic acid content, or from the body’sinability to digest foods or absorb foods having high folicacid content. Other factors that increase the risk of devel-oping folic acid deficiency anemia are:\n• age\n• alcoholism• birth-control pills, anticonvulsant therapy, sulfa antibi-\notics , and certain other medications\n• illness\n• smoking• stress\nFatigue is often the first sign of folic acid deficiency\nanemia. Other symptoms include:\n• anorexia nervosa• pale skin• paranoia\n• rapid heart beat\n• sore, inflamed tongue\n• weakness• weight loss\nDiagnosis\nDiagnostic procedures include blood tests to mea-\nsure hemoglobin, an iron-containing compound that car-ries oxygen to cells throughout the body. Symptoms maybe reevaluated after the patient has taken prescriptionfolic acid supplements.\nTreatment\nFolic acid supplements are usually prescribed, and\nself-care includes avoiding:\n• alcohol\n• non-herbal tea, antacids , and phosphates (contained in\nbeer, ice cream, and soft drinks), which restrict ironabsorption\n• tobacco\nA person with folic acid deficiency anemia should\nrest as often as necessary until restored energy levelsmake it possible to resume regular activities. A doctorshould be seen if fever , chills, muscle aches, or new\nsymptoms develop during treatment, or if symptoms donot improve after two weeks of treatment.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative therapies for folic acid deficiency ane-\nmia may include reflexology concentrated on areas that\ninfluence the liver and spleen. Increasing consumption offoods high in folate is helpful. Eating a mixture of yogurt(8 oz) and turmeric (1 tsp) also may help resolve symp-toms. A physician should be contacted if the tonguebecomes slick or smooth or the patient:\n• bruises or tires easily• feels ill for more than five days• feels weak or out of breath\n• looks pale or jaundiced\nPrognosis\nAlthough adequate folic acid intake usually cures\nthis condition in about three weeks, folic acid deficiencyanemia can make patients infertile or more susceptible toinfection. Severe deficiencies can result in congestiveheart failure .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1349Folic acid deficiency anemiaPrevention\nEating raw or lightly cooked vegetables every day\nwill help maintain normal folic acid levels, as will takinga folic acid supplement containing at least 400 mcg of thisvitamin. Because folic acid deficiency can cause birthdefects, all women of childbearing age who can becomepregnant should consume at least 400 mcg of folic aciddaily; a woman who is pregnant should have regular med-ical checkups, and take a good prenatal vitamin.\nResources\nBOOKS\nNew Choices in Natural Healing.

FSH is a hormone thatregulates the growth and development of eggs and sperm,and this test is used to diagnose or evaluate disordersinvolving the pituitary gland and reproductive system.\nPurpose\nFSH testing is performed if a physician suspects the\npatient may have a disorder involving the reproductivesystem or pituitary gland. The pituitary gland producesFSH, which stimulates the growth of the sacks (follicles)that surround the eggs in a woman’s ovaries. This isimportant for the process of ovulation, in which the eggis released. In men, FSH stimulates production of sperm.If there are abnormal levels of FSH in the blood it maymean that one of several disorders are present. Normalfluctuations occur as a result of puberty , the menstrual\ncycle, pregnancy , and menopause .\nThe FSH test is performed more often on women than\non men. In women, it is used to determine if menopausehas begun, to diagnose infertility and menstrual disor-ders (such as anovulatory bleeding), to measure hormone\nlevels in children who enter puberty at an early age, and todiagnose other disorders. In men, it can be used to deter-mine early puberty, abnormal tissue growth on one or moreof the hormone-secreting (endocrine) glands (called multi-ple endocrine neoplasia), or to diagnose other disorders.\nDescription\nThe FSH test is a blood test. Blood will be drawn\nfrom the patient and analyzed in a laboratory.\nPreparation\nIn preparation for the test, there are no food or fluid\nintake restrictions. Patients may be advised to discontinuecertain medications for 48 hours before the test. A men-struating woman having hot flashes or irregular periodsshould be tested on the second or third day of her menstru-al cycle. A woman who has missed a period and is havingother menopausal symptoms can be tested at any time.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is necessary.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with this test.\nNormal results\nNormal FSH test results vary according to age and\nsexual maturity. The phase of a woman’s menstrual cycleor use of birth-control pills also affects test results.\nFor an adult male, normal results range from about\n4–25 units of FSH in every liter of blood (U/L) or about5–20 micro-international units in every milliliter.\nFor a premenopausal woman, normal values range\nfrom 4–30 U/L or 5–20 micro-international units per milli-liter. In a pregnant woman, FSH levels are too low to mea-sure. After menopause, normal values range from 40–250U/L or 50–100 micro-international units per milliliter.\nFSH levels fluctuate during premenopause. If no\nother symptoms are present, an elevated FSH level shouldnot be interpreted as proof that menopause has begun.\nAbnormal results\nAnorexia nervosa and disorders of the hypothalamus\nor pituitary gland can result in abnormally low FSH levels.\nAbnormal levels can also indicate:\n• infertility• hypopituitarism\n• klinefelter syndrome (in men)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1350Follicle-stimulating hormone test• turner syndrome\n• ovarian failure• polycystic ovary syndrome\nResources\nBOOKS\nEverything You Need to Know About Medical Tests.

It can develop on any part of the body, but is mostlikely to occur on the scalp, face, or parts of the arms,armpits, or legs not usually covered by clothing.\nSmall, yellowish-white blister-like lumps (pustules)\nsurrounded by narrow red rings are usually present withboth bacterial folliculitis and fungal folliculitis. Hair cangrow through or alongside of the pustules, which some-times ooze blood-stained pus.\nFolliculitis can cause boils and, in rare instances,\nserious skin infections. Bacteria from folliculitis can enterthe blood stream and travel to other parts of the body.\nCauses and symptoms\nFolliculitis develops when bacteria, such as Staphy-\nlococcus, or a fungus enters the body through a cut,\nscrape, surgical incision, or other break in the skin near ahair follicle. Scratching the affected area can trap fungusor bacteria under the fingernails and spread the infectionto hair follicles on other parts of the body.\nThe bacteria that cause folliculitis are contagious. A\nperson who has folliculitis can infect others who live inthe same household.\nFactors that increase the risk of developing folliculi-\ntis include:\n• dermatitis\n• diabetes\n• dirty, crowded living conditions\n• eczema\n• exposure to hot, humid temperatures\n• infection in the nose or other recent illness\n• tight clothing\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on the patient’s medical history\nand observations. Laboratory analysis of the substancedrained from a pustule can be used to distinguish bacteri-al folliculitis from fungal folliculitis.\nTreatment\nBacterial folliculitis may disappear without treat-\nment, but is likely to recur. Non-prescription topicalantibiotics like Bacitracin, Mycitracin, or Neomycin,\ngently rubbed on to affected areas three or four times aday, can clear up a small number of bacterial folliculitispustules. Oral antibiotics such as erythromycin (Ery-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1351Folliculitisthocin) may be prescribed if the infection is widespread.\nThe drug griseofulvin (Fulvicin) and topical antifungalmedications are used to treat fungal folliculitis.\nA doctor should be notified if:\n• pustules spread after treatment has begun or reappear\nafter treatment is completed\n• the patient’s fever climbs above 100°F (37.8°C)\n• the patient develops boils or swollen ankles\n• redness, swelling, warmth, or pain indicate that the\ninfection has spread\n• unexplained new symptoms appear\nAlternative treatment\nEating a balanced diet, including protein, complex car-\nbohydrates, healthy fats, fresh fruits and vegetables, anddrinking eight to 10 glasses of water a day may stimulatethe body’s immune system and shorten the course of theinfection. Garlic ( Allium sativum ) and goldenseal\n(Hydrastis canadensis ), both antiseptic agents against staph\ninfections, may be taken. The daily dosage would varyfrom person to person and is based on the severity of theinfection. Echinacea (Echinacea spp.) is helpful in modu-\nlating immune function. Again, the dosage would vary.\nDaily doses of 30–50 mg zinc and 1,000–5,000 mg\nVitamin C (taken in equal amounts at several times dur-ing the day), and 300–2,000 mg bioflavinoids can alsostrengthen the body’s infection-fighting ability. Highdoses of vitamins and minerals should not be used with-\nout a doctor’s approval.\nPrognosis\nIf properly treated, the symptoms of bacterial folli-\nculitis generally disappear in about two weeks. Fungalfolliculitis should clear up within six weeks. But it canworsen if the condition is misdiagnosed and inappropri-ately treated with steroid creams.\nPrevention\nAnyone who has a tendency to develop folliculitis\nshould cleanse the skin with antibacterial soap twice aday and before shaving and should not use oily skinlotions. Men should not shave while the beard area isinfected. When they begin shaving again, they should usea new blade each time. Women who have had fungal fol-liculitis should use depilatory creams instead of razors.Daily shampooing can help prevent folliculitis in thescalp.

    "title": "Food poisoning",
    "content": "Food poisoning\nDefinition\nFood poisoning is a general term for health prob-\nlems arising from eating contaminated food. Food maybe contaminated by bacteria, viruses, environmental tox-ins, or toxins present within the food itself, such as thepoisons in some mushrooms or certain seafood. Symp-toms of food poisoning usually involve nausea, vomiting\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1352Food poisoning\nAcne folliculitis. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\npermission.)and/or diarrhea . Some food-borne toxins can affect the\nnervous system.\nDescription\nEvery year millions of people suffer from bouts of\nvomiting and diarrhea each year that they blame on“something I ate.” These people are generally correct.Each year in the United States, one to two bouts of diar-rheal illness occur in every adult. The Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there arefrom six to 33 million cases of food poisoning in the Unit-ed States annually. Many cases are mild and pass so rapid-ly that they are never diagnosed. Occasionally a severeoutbreak creates a newsworthy public health hazard.\nClassical food poisoning, sometimes incorrectly\ncalled ptomaine poisoning, is caused by a variety of dif-ferent bacteria. The most common are Salmonella ,\nStaphylococcus aureus ,Escherichia coli O157:H7 or\nother E. coli strains, Shigella , and Clostridium\nbotulinum . Each has a slightly different incubation peri-\nod and duration, but all except C. botulinum cause\ninflammation of the intestines and diarrhea. Sometimesfood poisoning is called bacterial gastroenteritis or\ninfectious diarrhea. Food and water can also be contami-nated by viruses (such as the Norwalk agent that causesdiarrhea and the viruses of hepatitis A and E), environ-\nmental toxins (heavy metals), and poisons producedwithin the food itself ( mushroom poisoning or fish and\nshellfish poisoning ).\nCareless food handling during the trip from farm to\ntable creates conditions for the growth of bacteria thatmake people sick. Vegetables that are eaten raw, such as let-tuce, may be contaminated by bacteria in soil, water, anddust during washing and packing. Home canned and com-mercially canned food may be improperly processed at toolow a temperature or for too short a time to kill the bacteria.\nRaw meats carry many food-borne bacterial dis-\neases. The United States Food and Drug Administration(FDA) estimates that 60% or more of raw poultry sold atretail carry some disease-causing bacteria. Other rawmeat products and eggs are contaminated to a lesserdegree. Thorough cooking kills the bacteria and makesthe food harmless. However, properly cooked food canbecome re-contaminated if it comes in contact withplates, cutting boards, countertops, or utensils that wereused with raw meat and not cleaned and sanitized.\nCooked foods can also be contaminated after cook-\ning by bacteria carried by food handlers or from bacteriain the environment. It is estimated that 50% of healthypeople have the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in their\nnasal passages and throat, and on their skin and hair.Rubbing a runny nose, then touching food can introducethe bacteria into cooked food. Bacteria flourish at room\ntemperature, and will rapidly grow into quantities capa-ble of making people sick. To prevent this growth, foodmust be kept hot or cold, but never just warm.\nAlthough the food supply in the United States is\nprobably the safest in the world, anyone can get foodpoisoning. Serious outbreaks are rare. When they occur,the very young, the very old, and those with immune sys-tem weaknesses have the most severe and life-threaten-ing cases. For example, this group is 20 times more like-ly to become infected with the Salmonella bacteria than\nthe general population.\nTravel outside the United States to countries where\nless attention is paid to sanitation, water purification, andgood food handling practices increases the chances that aperson will get food poisoning. People living in institu-tions such as nursing homes are also more likely to getfood poisoning.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe symptoms of food poisoning occur because\nfood-borne bacteria release toxins or poisons as abyproduct of their growth in the body. These toxins(except those from C. botulinum ) cause inflammation\nand swelling of the stomach, small intestine and/or largeintestine. The result is abdominal muscle cramping,vomiting, diarrhea, fever , and the chance of dehydra-\ntion. The severity of symptoms depends on the type of\nbacteria, the amount consumed, and the individual’s gen-eral health and sensitivity to the bacterial toxin.\nSalmonella\nAccording to a 2001 report from the CDC, Salmo-\nnella caused almost 50,000 culture-confirmed cases of\nfood poisoning in the United States annually. However,between two and four million probably occur each year.Salmonella is found in egg yolks from infected chickens,\nin raw and undercooked poultry and in other meats, dairyproducts, fish, shrimp, and many more foods. The CDCestimates that one out of every 50 consumers is exposedto a contaminated egg yolk each year. However, thoroughcooking kills the bacteria and makes the food harmless.Salmonella is also found in the feces of pet reptiles such\nas turtles, lizards, and snakes.\nAbout one out of every 1,000 people get food poi-\nsoning from Salmonella . Of these, two-thirds are under\nage 20, with the majority under age nine. Most casesoccur in the warm months between July and October.\nSymptoms of food poisoning begin eight to 72 hours\nafter eating food contaminated with Salmonella . These\ninclude traditional food poisoning symptoms of abdomi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1353Food poisoningnal pain , diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. The symptoms\ngenerally last one to five days. Dehydration can be acomplication in severe cases. People generally recoverwithout antibiotic treatment, although they may feel tiredfor a week after the active symptoms subside.\nStaphylococcus aureus\nStaphylococcus aureus is found on humans and in\nthe environment in dust, air, and sewage. The bacteria isspread primarily by food handlers using poor sanitarypractices. Almost any food can be contaminated, butsalad dressings, milk products, cream pastries, and anyfood kept at room temperature, rather than hot or cold arelikely candidates.\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of cases of food\npoisoning from Staphylococcus aureus that occur each\nyear, because its symptoms are so similar to those causedby other foodborne bacteria. Many cases are mild and thevictim never sees a doctor.\nSymptoms appear rapidly, usually one to six hours\nafter the contaminated food is eaten. The acute symp-toms of vomiting and severe abdominal cramps withoutfever usually last only three to six hours and rarely morethan 24 hours. Most people recover without medicalassistance. Deaths are rare.\nEscherichia coli (E. coli)\nThere are many strains of E. coli , and not all of them\nare harmful. The strain that causes most severe food poi-soning is E. coli O157:H7 . Food poisoning by E. coli\noccurs in three out of every 10,000 people. Foodborne E.\ncoliis found and transmitted mainly in food derived from\ncows such as raw milk, raw or rare ground beef and fruitor vegetables that are contaminated.\nSymptoms of food poisoning from E. coli are slower\nto appear than those caused by some of the other food-borne bacteria. E. coli produces toxins in the large intes-\ntine rather than higher up in the digestive system. Thisaccounts for the delay in symptoms and the fact thatvomiting rarely occurs in E. coli food poisoning.\nOne to three days after eating contaminated food, the\nvictim with E. coli O157:H7 begins to have severe abdom-\ninal cramps and watery diarrhea that usually becomesbloody within 24 hours. There is little or no fever, andrarely does the victim vomit. The bloody, watery diarrhealasts from one to eight days in uncomplicated cases.\nCampylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni)\nAccording to the FDA, C. jejuni is the leading cause of\nbacterial diarrhea in the United States. It is responsible formore cases of bacterial diarrhea than Shigella and Salmo-nella combined. Anyone can get food poisoning from C.\njejuni , but children under five and young adults between\nthe ages of 15 and 29 are more frequently infected.\nC. jejuni is carried by healthy cattle, chickens, birds,\nand flies. It is not carried by healthy people in the UnitedStates or Europe. The bacteria is also found ponds andstream water. The ingestion of only a few hundred C.\njejuni bacteria can make a person sick.\nSymptoms of food poisoning begin two to five days\nafter eating food contaminated with C. jejuni . These\nsymptoms include fever, abdominal pain, nausea,headache , muscle pain, and diarrhea. The diarrhea can\nbe watery or sticky and may contain blood. Symptomslast from seven to 10 days, and relapses occur in aboutone quarter of people who are infected. Dehydration is acommon complication. Other complications such asarthritis-like joint pain and hemolytic-uremic syndrome\n(HUS) are rare.\nShigella\nShigella is a common cause of diarrhea in travelers\nto developing countries. It is associated with contaminat-ed food and water, crowded living conditions, and poorsanitation. The bacterial toxins affect the small intestine.\nSymptoms of food poisoning by Shigella appear\n36–72 hours after eating contaminated food. These symp-toms are slightly different from those associated with mostfoodborne bacteria. In addition to the familiar watery diar-rhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, chills and feveroccur. The diarrhea may be quite severe with cramps pro-gressing to classical dysentery. Up to 40% of children withsevere infections show neurological symptoms. Theseinclude seizures caused by fever, confusion, headache,lethargy, and a stiff neck that resembles meningitis .\nThe disease runs its course usually in two to three\ndays but may last longer. Dehydration is a common com-plication. Most people recover on their own, althoughthey may feel exhausted, but children who are malnour-ished or have weakened immune systems may die.\nClostridium botulinum (C. botulinum)\nC. botulinum , which causes both adult botulism and\ninfant botulism, is unlike any of the other foodborne bac-teria. First, C. botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium in\nthat it can only live in the absence of oxygen. Second, thetoxins from C. botulinum are neurotoxins. They poison\nthe nervous system, causing paralysis without the vomit-\ning and diarrhea associated with other foodborne illness-es. Third, toxins that cause adult botulism are releasedwhen the bacteria grows in an airless environment out-side the body. They can be broken down and made harm-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1354Food poisoningless by heat. Finally, botulism is much more likely to be\nfatal even in tiny quantities.\nAdult botulism outbreaks are usually associated\nwith home canned food, although occasionally commer-cially canned or vacuum packed foods are responsiblefor the disease. C. botulinum grows well in non-acidic,\noxygen-free environments. If food is canned at too lowheat or for too brief a time, the bacteria is not killed. Itreproduces inside the can or jar, releasing its deadly neu-rotoxin. The toxin can be made harmless by heating thecontaminated food to boiling for ten minutes. However,even a very small amount of the C. botulinum toxin can\ncause serious illness or death .\nSymptoms of adult botulism appear about 18–36\nhours after the contaminated food is eaten, althoughthere are documented times of onset ranging from fourhours to eight days. Initially a person suffering from bot-ulism feels weakness and dizziness followed by double\nvision. Symptoms progress to difficulty speaking andswallowing. Paralysis moves down the body, and whenthe respiratory muscles are paralyzed, death results fromasphyxiation. People who show any signs of botulismpoisoning must receive immediate emergency medicalcare to increase their chance of survival.\nInfant botulism is a form of botulism first recog-\nnized in 1976. It differs from food-borne botulism in itscauses and symptoms. Infant botulism occurs when achild under the age of one year ingests the spores of C.\nbotulinum . These spores are found in soil, but a more\ncommon source of spores is honey.\nThe C. botulinum spores lodge in the baby’s intesti-\nnal tract and begin to grow, producing their neurotoxin.Onset of symptoms is gradual. Initially the baby is consti-pated. This is followed by poor feeding, lethargy, weak-ness, drooling, and a distinctive wailing cry. Eventually,the baby loses the ability to control its head muscles.From there the paralysis progresses to the rest of the body.\nDiagnosis\nOne important aspect of diagnosing food poisoning\nis for doctors to determine if a number of people haveeaten the same food and show the same symptoms of ill-ness. When this happens, food poisoning is strongly sus-pected. The diagnosis is confirmed when the suspectedbacteria is found in a stool culture or a fecal smear from\nthe person. Other laboratory tests are used to isolate bac-teria from a sample of the contaminated food. Botulismis usually diagnosed from its distinctive neurologicalsymptoms, since rapid treatment is essential. Many casesof food poisoning go undiagnosed, since a definite diag-nosis is not necessary to effectively treat the symptoms.Because it takes time for symptoms to develop, it is notnecessarily the most recent food one has eaten that is the\ncause of the symptoms.\nTreatment\nTreatment of food poisoning, except that caused by\nC. botulinum, focuses on preventing dehydration by\nreplacing fluids and electrolytes lost through vomitingand diarrhea. Electrolytes are salts and minerals that\nform electrically charges particles (ions) in body fluids.Electrolytes are important because they control bodyfluid balance and are important for all major body reac-tions. Pharmacists can recommend effective, pleasant-tasting, electrolytically balanced replacement fluidsthat are available without a prescription. When morefluids are being lost than can be consumed, dehydrationmay occur. Dehydration more likely to happen in thevery young, the elderly, and people who are takingdiuretics . To prevent dehydration, a doctor may give\nfluids intravenously.\nIn very serious cases of food poisoning, medications\nmay be given to stop abdominal cramping and vomiting.Anti-diarrheal medications are not usually given. Stop-ping the diarrhea keeps the toxins in the body longer andmay prolong the infection.\nPeople with food poisoning should modify their diet.\nDuring period of active vomiting and diarrhea theyshould not try to eat and should drink only clear liquidsfrequently but in small quantities. Once active symptomsstop, they should eat bland, soft, easy to digest foods fortwo to three days. One example is the BRAT diet ofbananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, all of which are easyto digest. Milk products, spicy food, alcohol and freshfruit should be avoided for a few days, although babiesshould continue to breastfeed. These modifications areoften all the treatment that is necessary.\nSevere bacterial food poisonings are sometimes\ntreated with antibiotics .

    "content": "Foot care\nDefinition\nFoot care involves all aspects of preventative and\ncorrective care of the foot and ankle. Doctors specializ-ing in foot care are called podiatrists.\nPurpose\nDuring an average lifetime, each person walks about\n115,000 miles and three-quarters of people have footproblems at some point in their lives.\nFoot problems can arise from wearing ill-fitting\nshoes, from general wear and tear, as a result of injury, oras a complication of disease. People with diabetes melli-\ntusor circulatory diseases are 20 times more likely to\nhave foot problems than the general public.\nPodiatrists are doctors who specialize in treating the\nfoot and ankle. Other doctors who have experience withfoot problems are family physicians, orthopedists, sportsmedicine specialists, and those who care for diabetics.Problems with the feet include foot pain , joint inflamma-\ntion, plantar warts , fungal infections (like athlete’s\nfoot), nerve disorders, torn ligaments, broken bones, bac-\nterial infections, and tissue injuries (like frostbite).\nPrecautions\nPeople with diabetes or circulatory disorders should\nbe alert to even small foot problems. In these people, abreak in the skin can lead to infection, gangrene , and\namputation .\nDescription\nDaily foot care for people likely to develop foot\nproblems includes washing the feet in tepid water withmild soap and oiling the feet with vegetable oil or a lano-lin-based lotion. Toenails should be cut straight acrossabove the level of the skin after soaking the feet in tepidwater. Corns and calluses should not be cut. If they need\nremoval, it should be done under the care of a doctor.Athletes foot and plantar warts should also be treated bya doctor if they develop in high risk patients.Many people with diabetes or circulatory disorders\nhave problems with cold feet. These problems can bereduced by avoiding smoking tobacco (smoking con-\nstricts the blood vessels), wearing warm socks, not cross-ing the legs while sitting or not sitting in one position toolong, or avoiding constricting stockings.\nPeople with circulatory problems should not use heat-\ning pads or hot water bottles on their feet, as even moder-ate heat can damage the skin if circulation is impaired.\nPreparation\nNo special preparation other than an understanding\nof the nature of foot problems is necessary to begin rou-tine foot care.\nAftercare\nFoot care is preventative and should be ongoing\nthroughout a person’s life.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with foot care. The risks\nare in ignoring the feet and allowing problems to develop.\nNormal results\nWith regular care, foot disorders such as infections,\nskin ulcers, and gangrene can be prevented.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Foot Problems.” In The Complete Guide to Symptoms, Illness\nand Surgery. 3rd ed.

    "content": "Foreign objects\nDefinition\n“Foreign” means “originating elsewhere” or simply\n“outside the body.” Foreign bodies typically become\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1357Foreign objectslodged in the eyes, ears, nose, airways, and rectum of\nhuman beings.\nDescription\nBoth children and adults experience problems\ncaused by foreign objects getting stuck in their bodies.Young children, in particular, are naturally curious andmay intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins orbutton batteries, into their mouths. They also like tostick things in their ears and up their noses. Adults mayaccidentally swallow a non-food object or inhale a for-eign body that gets stuck in the throat. Even if an objectlike a toothpick successfully passes through the esopha-gus and into the stomach, it can get stuck inside the rec-tum. Airborne particles can lodge in the eyes of peopleat any age.\nForeign bodies can be in hollow organs (like swal-\nlowed batteries) or in tissues (like bullets). They can beinert or irritating. If they irritate they will cause inflam-mation and scarring. They can bring infection with them\nor acquire it and protect it from the body’s immunedefenses. They can obstruct passageways either by theirsize or by the scarring they cause. Some can be toxic.\nCauses and symptoms\nEyes\nDust, dirt, sand, or other airborne material can lodge\nin the eyes, causing minor irritation and redness. Moreserious damage can be caused by hard or sharp objectsthat penetrate the surface and become embedded in thecornea or conjunctiva (the mucous membranes aroundthe inner surface of the eyelids). Swelling, redness,bleeding from the surface blood vessels, sensitivity tolight, and sudden vision problems are all symptoms offoreign matter in the eyes.\nEars and nose\nChildren will sometimes put things into their noses,\nears, and other openings. Beans, popcorn kernels, raisins,and beads are just a few of the many items that have beenfound in these bodily cavities. On occasion, insects mayalso fly into the ears and nose. Pain ,hearing loss , and a\nsense of something stuck in the ear are symptoms of for-eign bodies in the ears. A smelly, bloody discharge fromone nostril is a symptom of foreign bodies in the nose.\nAirways and stomach\nAt a certain age children will eat anything. A very\npartial list of items recovered from young stomachsincludes the following: Coins, chicken bones, fish bones,beads, rocks, plastic toys, pins, keys, round stones, mar-bles, nails, rings, batteries, ball bearings, screws, staples,washers, a heart pendant, a clothespin spring, and a toysoldier. Some of these items will pass right on throughand come out the other end. The progress of metal objectshas been successfully followed with a metal detector.Others, like sharp bones, can get stuck and cause trouble.Batteries are corrosive and must be removed immediately.\nChildren eat things and stick things into their bodily\nopenings of their own volition. But they inhale themunwittingly. The most commonly inhaled item is probablya peanut. A crayon and a cockroach have been found in achild’s windpipes. These items always cause symptoms(difficulty swallowing and spitting up saliva, for instance)and may elude detection for some time while the child isbeing treated for asthma or recurring pneumonia .\nAdults are not exempt from unorthodox inedibles.\nDental devices are commonly swallowed. Adults withmental illness or subversive motives may swallow inap-propriate objects, such as toothbrushes.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1358Foreign objects\nX ray of swallowed spoon and blade in the intestine. (Photo\nResearchers. Reproduced by permission.)Rectum\nSometimes a foreign object will successfully pass\nthrought the throat and stomach only to get stuck at thejuncture between the rectum and the anal canal. Itemsmay also be self-introduced to enhance sexual stimula-tion and then get stuck. Sudden sharp pain during elimi-nation may signify that an object is lodged in the rectum.Other symptoms vary depending upon the size of theobject, its location, how long it has been in place, andwhether or not infection has set in.\nDiagnosis\nThe symptoms are as diverse as the objects and their\nlocations. The most common manifestation of a foreignobject anywhere in the body is infection. Even if theobject started out sterile, germs still seem to find it andare able to hide from the body’s defenses there. Blockageof passageways—breathing, digestive or excretory—isanother result. Pain is common.\nTreatment\nEyes\nSmall particles like sand may be removable without\nmedical help, but if the object is not visible or cannot beretrieved, prompt emergency treatment is necessary.Trauma to the eyes can lead to loss of vision and shouldnever be ignored. Before attempting any treatment, theperson should move to a well-lighted area where theobject can be more easily spotted. Hands should bewashed and only clean, preferably sterile, materialsshould make contact with the eyes. If the particle issmall, it can be dislodged by blinking or pulling theupper lid over the lower lid and flushing out the speck. Aclean cloth can also be used to pick out the offendingparticle. Afterwards, the eye should be rinsed with clean,lukewarm water or an opthalmic wash.\nIf the foreign object cannot be removed at home, the\neye should be lightly covered with sterile gauze to dis-courage rubbing. A physician will use a strong light andpossibly special eyedrops to locate the object. Surgicaltweezers can effectively remove many objects. Anantibiotic sterile ointment and a patch may be pre-scribed. If the foreign body has penetrated the deeperlayers of the eye, an opthalmic surgeon will be consultedfor emergency treatment.\nEars and nose\nA number of ingenious extraction methods have\nbeen devised for removing foreign objects from the noseand ears. A bead in a nostril, for example, can be poppedKEY TERMS\nBronchoscope —An illuminated instrument that is\ninserted into the airway to inspect and retrieveobjects from the bronchial tubes.\nConjunctiva —Mucous membranes around the\ninner surface of the eyelid.\nCornea —The rounded, transparent portion of the\neye that covers the pupil and iris and lets light intothe interior\nEndoscopy —The surgical use of long, thin instru-\nments that have both viewing and operating capa-bilities.\nHeimlich maneuver —An emergency procedure\nfor removing a foreign object lodged in the airwaythat is preventing the person from breathing. Toperform the Heimlich maneuver on a consciousadult, the rescuer stands behind the victim andencircles his waist. The rescuer makes a fist withone hand and places the other hand on top, posi-tioned below the rib cage and above the waist.The rescuer then applies pressure by a series ofupward and inward thrusts to force the foreignobject back up the victim’s trachea.\nout by blowing into the mouth while holding the other\nnostril closed. Skilled practitioners have removed peasfrom the ears by tiny improvised corkscrews; marbles byq-tips with super glue. Tweezers often work well, too.Insects can be floated out of the ear by pouring warm(not hot) mineral oil, olive oil, or baby oil into the earcanal. Items that are lodged deep in the ear canal aremore difficult to remove because of the possibility ofdamaging the ear drum. These require emergency treat-ment from a qualified physician.\nAirways and stomach\nMechanical obstruction of the airways, which com-\nmonly occurs when food gets lodged in the throat, can betreated by applying the Heimlich maneuver . If the object\nis lodged lower in the airway, a bronchoscope (a specialinstrument to view the airway and remove obstructions)can be inserted. On other occasions, as when the object isblocking the entrance to the stomach, a fiberoptic endo-scope (an illuminated instrument that views the interior ofa body cavity) may be used. The physician typicallyadministers a sedative and anesthetizes the throat. Theforeign object will then either be pulled out or pushed intothe stomach, depending on whether or not the physician\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1359Foreign objectsthinks it will pass through the digestive tract on its own.\nObjects in the digestive tract that are neither irritating,sharp nor large may be followed as they continue onthrough. Sterile objects that are causing no symptomsmay be left in place. Surgical removal of the offendingobject is necessary if it is causing symptoms.\nRectum\nA rectal retractor can remove objects that a physi-\ncian can feel during physical examination . Surgery may\nbe required for objects deeply lodged within the recturm.\nPrevention\nUsing common sense and following safety precau-\ntions are the best ways to prevent foreign objects fromentering the body. For instance, parents and grandparentsshould toddler-proof their homes, storing batteries in alocked cabinet and properly disposing of used batteries,so they are not in a location where curious preschoolerscan fish them out of a wastebasket. To minimize thechance of youngsters inhaling food, parents should notallow children to eat while walking or playing. Adultsshould chew food thoroughly and not talk while chew-ing.

    "title": "Fracture repair",
    "content": "Fracture repair\nDefinition\nFracture repair is the process of rejoining and\nrealigning the ends of broken bones. This procedure isusually performed by an orthopedist, general surgeon, orfamily doctor. In cases of an emergency, first aid mea-sures should be evoked for temporary realignment andimmobilization until proper medical help is available.\nPurpose\nFracture repair is required when there is a need for\nrestoration of the normal position and function of the bro-ken bone. Throughout the stages of fracture healing, thebones must be held firmly in the correct position. In theevent the fracture is not properly repaired, malalignmentof the bone may occur, resulting in possible physical dys-function of the bone or joint of that region of the body.\nPrecautions\nPrecautions for fracture repair are anything found to\nbe significant with patients’ medical diagnosis and histo-ry. This would include an individual’s tolerance to anes-thesia and the presence of bleeding disorders that may bepresent to complicate surgery.\nDescription\nFracture repair is applied by means of traction ,\nsurgery, and/or by immobilization of the bones. The bonefragments are aligned as close as possible to the normalposition without injuring the skin. Metal wires or screwsmay be needed to align smaller bone fragments. Once the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1360Fracture repairbroken ends of the bone are set, the affected area is\nimmobilized for several weeks and kept rigid with asling, plaster cast, brace or splint. With the use of trac-tion, muscle pull on the fracture site is overcome byweights attached to a series of ropes running over pul-leys. Strategically implanted electrical stimulationdevices have proven beneficial in healing a fracture site,especially when the fracture is healing poorly and repairby other means is difficult.\nPreparation\nEmergency splinting may be required to immobilize\nthe body part or parts involved. When fracture repair isnecessary, the procedure is often performed in a hospitalbut can also be successfully done in an outpatient surgi-cal facility, doctor’s office or emergency room. Beforeany surgery for fracture repair, blood and urine studiesmay be taken from the patient. X rays may follow this ifnot previously acquired. It has been noted however, thatnot all fractures are immediately apparent on an initial\nx-ray examination. In this case, where a fracture is defi-nitely suspected the extent of the fracture can be properlydiagnosed by repeating the x rays 10–14 days later.Depending upon the situation, local or general anesthesiamay be used for fracture repair.\nAftercare\nAfter surgery, x rays may be again taken through the\ncast or splint to evaluate if rejoined pieces remain in goodposition for healing. This is usually performed either beforethe application of the splint or at least before the patient isawakened from the general anesthesia. The patient needs tobe cautious not to place excess pressure on any part of thecast until it is completely dry. The patient also should avoidexcess pressure on the operative site until complete healinghas taken place and the injury has been re-examined by thephysician. If the cast becomes exposed to moisture it maysoften and require repair. The patient should also beinstructed to keep the injured region propped up wheneverpossible to reduce the possibility of swelling.\nRisks\nSurgical risks of fracture repair are greater in\npatients over 60 years of age because the bones often tak-ing longer to heal properly. Obesity may place extra\nstress on the healing site, affecting healing and possibly\nrisking reinjury. Smoking may slow the healing process\nafter fracture repair, as well as poor nutrition ,alco-\nholism , and chronic illness. Some medications may\naffect the fracture site, causing poor union. Such medica-tions include anti-hypertensives and cortisone.Possible complications following fracture repair\ninclude excessive bleeding, improper fit of joined boneends, pressure on nearby nerves, delayed healing, and apermanent incomplete healing of the fracture. If there isa poor blood supply to the fractured site with one of theportions of broken bone not properly supplied by theblood, the bony portion will die and healing of the frac-ture will not take place. This is called aseptic necrosis.Poor immobilization of the fracture from improper cast-ing which permits motion between the bone parts mayprevent healing and repair of the bone with possibledeformity. Infection can interfere with bone repair. Thisrisk is greater in the case of a compound fracture (a bonefracture causing an open wound) where ideal conditionsare present for severe streptococcal and staphylococcal\ninfections . Occasionally, fractured bones in the elderly\nmay possibly never heal properly. The risk is increasedwhen nutrition is poor.\nNormal results\nOnce the procedure for fracture repair is completed,\nthe body begins to produce new tissue to bridge the bro-ken pieces. At first, this tissue (called a callus) is soft andeasily injured. Later, the body deposits bone minerals\nuntil the callus becomes a solid piece of bone. The frac-ture site is thus strengthened further with extra bone. Itusually takes about six weeks for a broken bone to healtogether. The exact time required for healing depends onthe type of fracture and the extent of damage. Before theuse of x rays, fracture repair was not always accurate,resulting in crippling deformities. With modern x-raytechnology, the physician can view the extent of the frac-ture, check the setting following the repair, and be certainafter the procedure that the bones have not moved fromtheir intended alignment. Children’s bones usually healrelatively rapidly.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1361Fracture repair\nAn x-ray image of a healing fracture. (Photograph by Bates,\nM.D., Custom Medical Stock Photo.

    "content": "Fractures\nDefinition\nA fracture is a complete or incomplete break in a\nbone resulting from the application of excessive force.KEY TERMS\nCompound fracture — A fracture in which the\nbroken end or ends of the bone have torn throughthe skin. Compound fractures are also known asopen fractures\nStaphylococcal infection —An infection caused\nby any of several pathogenic species of staphylo-coccus, commonly characterized by the formationof abscesses of the skin or other organs.\nStreptococcal infection —An infection caused by\na pathogenic bacteria of one of several species ofthe genus streptococcus or their toxins. Almostany organ in the body may be involved.Description\nA fracture usually results from traumatic injury to\nbones causing the continuity of bone tissues or bony carti-lage to be disrupted or broken. Fracture classificationsinclude simple, compound, incomplete and complete.Simple fractures (more recently called “closed”) are notobvious as the skin has not been ruptured and remainsintact. Compound fractures (now commonly called“open”) break the skin, exposing bone and causing addi-tional soft tissue injury and possible infection. A singlefracture means that one fracture only has occurred andmultiple fractures refer to more than one fracture occur-ring in the same bone. Fractures are termed complete ifthe break is completely through the bone and described asincomplete or “greenstick” if the fracture occurs partlyacross a bone shaft. This latter type of fracture is often theresult of bending or crushing forces applied to a bone.\nFractures are also named according to the specific\npart of the bone involved and the nature of the break.Identification of a fracture line can further classify frac-tures. Types include linear, oblique, transverse, longitu-dinal, and spiral fractures. Fractures can be further subdi-vided by the positions of bony fragments and aredescribed as comminuted, non-displaced, impacted,overriding, angulated, displaced, avulsed, and segmental.Additionally, an injury may be classified as a fracture-dislocation when a fracture involves the bony structuresof any joint with associated dislocation of the same joint.\nFractures line identification\nLinear fractures have a break that runs parallel to the\nbone’s main axis or in the direction of the bone’s shaft.For example, a linear fracture of the arm bone couldextend the entire length of the bone. Oblique and trans-verse fractures differ in that an oblique fracture crosses abone at approximately a 45° angle to the bone’s axis. Incontrast, a transverse fracture crosses a bone’s axis at a90° angle. A longitudinal fracture is similar to a linearfracture. Its fracture line extends along the shaft but ismore irregular in shape and does not run parallel to thebone’s axis. Spiral fractures are described as crossing abone at an oblique angle, creating a spiral pattern. Thisbreak usually occurs in the long bones of the body such asthe upper arm bone (humerus) or the thigh bone (femur).\nBony fragment position identification\nComminuted fractures have two or more fragments\nbroken into small pieces, in addition to the upper andlower halves of a fractured bone. Fragments of bone thatmaintain their normal alignment following a fracture aredescribed as being non-displaced. An impacted fractureis characterized as a bone fragment forced into or onto\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1362Fracturesanother fragment resulting from a compressive force.\nOverriding is a term used to describe bony fragmentsthat overlap and shorten the total length of a bone.Angulated fragments result in pieces of bone being atangles to each other. A displaced bony fragment occursfrom disruption of normal bone alignment with deformi-ty of these segments separate from one another. Anavulsed fragment occurs when bone fragments arepulled from their normal position by forceful musclecontractions or resistance from ligaments. Segmentalfragmented positioning occurs if fractures in two adja-cent areas occur, leaving an isolated central segment. Anexample of segmental alignment is when the arm bonefractures in two separate places, with displacement ofthe middle section of bone.\nCauses and symptoms\nIndividuals with high activity levels appear to be at\ngreater risk for fractures. This group includes childrenand athletes participating in contact sports. Because of anincrease in bone brittleness with aging , elderly persons\nare also included in this high-risk population. Up to theage of 50, more men suffer from fractures than women\ndue to occupational hazards. However, after the age of50, women are more prone to fractures than men. Specif-ic diseases causing an increased risk for fractures includePaget’s disease, rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta ,osteo-\nporosis , bone cancer and tumors, and prolonged disuse\nof a nonfunctional body part such as after a stroke .\nSymptoms of fractures usually begin with pain that\nincreases with attempted movement or use of the areaand swelling at the involved site. The skin in the areamay be pale and an obvious deformity may be present. Inmore severe cases, there may be a loss of pulse below thefracture site, such as in the extremities, accompanied bynumbness, tingling, or paralysis below the fracture. An\nopen or compound fracture is often accompanied bybleeding or bruising. If the lower limbs or pelvis are frac-tured, pain and resistance to movement usually accompa-ny the injury causing difficulty with weight bearing.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis begins immediately with an individual’s\nown observation of symptoms.

(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)tory and physical exam by a physician often reveals the\npresence of a fracture. An x ray of the injured area is themost common test used to determine the presence of abone fracture. Any x ray series performed involves atleast two views of the area to confirm the presence of thefracture because not all fractures are apparent on a singlex-ray. Some fractures are often difficult to see and mayrequire several views at different angles to see clear frac-ture lines. In some cases, CT, MRI or other imaging testsare required to demonstrate fracture. Sometimes, espe-cially with children, the initial x ray may not show anyfractures but repeat x rays seven to 14 days later mayshow changes in the bone(s) of the affected area. If afracture is open and occurs in conjunction with soft tis-sue injury, further laboratory studies are often conductedto determine if blood loss has occurred.\nIn the event of exercise-related stress fractures\n(micro-fractures due to excessive stress), a tuning forkcan provide a simple, inexpensive test.

Over time, bone mass and strength\nare reduced leading to increased risk of fractures.\nPaget’s disease —Chromic disorder of unknown\ncause, usually affecting middle aged and elderlypeople, characterized by enlarged and deformedbones. Excessive breakdown and formation of bonetissue occurs with Paget’s disease and can causebone to weaken, resulting in bone pain, arthritis,deformities, and fractures.\nReduction —The restoration of a body part to its\noriginal position after displacement, such as thereduction of a fractured bone by bringing ends orfragments back into original alignment. The use oflocal or general anesthesia usually accompanies afracture reduction.

If an individual has increased painwhen the tuning fork is placed on a bone, such as thetibia or shinbone, the likelihood of a stress fracture ishigh. Bone scans also are helpful in detecting stress frac-tures. In this diagnostic procedure, a radioactive tracer isinjected into the bloodstream and images are taken ofspecific areas or the entire skeleton by CT or MRI.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the type of fracture, its severi-\nty, the individual’s age and general health. The first prior-ity in treating any fracture is to address the entire medicalstatus of the patient. Medical personnel are trained notallow a painful, deformed limb to distract them frompotentially life-threatening injury elsewhere or shock . If\nan open fracture is accompanied by serious soft tissueinjury, it may be necessary to control bleeding and theshock that can accompany loss of blood.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1364FracturesFirst aid is the appropriate initial treatment in emer-\ngency situations. It includes proper splinting, control ofblood loss, and monitoring vital signs such as breathingand circulation.\nImmobilization\nImmobilization of a fracture site can be done inter-\nnally or externally. The primary goal of immobilizationis to maintain the realignment of a bone long enough forhealing to start and progress. Immobilization by externalfixation uses splints, casts, or braces. This may be theprimary and only procedure for fracture treatment.Splinting to immobilize a fracture can be done with orwithout traction . In emergency situations if the injured\nindividual must be moved by someone other than atrained medical person, splinting is a useful form of frac-ture management. It should be done without causingadditional pain and without moving the bone segments.In a clinical environment, plaster of Paris casts are usedfor immobilization. Braces are useful as they often allowmovement above and below a fracture site. Treatmentsfor stress fractures include rest and decreasing or stop-ping any activity that causes or increases pain.\nFracture reduction\nFracture reduction is the procedure by which a frac-\ntured bone is realigned in normal position. It can beeither closed or open. Closed reduction refers to realign-ing bones without breaking the skin. It is performed withmanual manipulation and/or traction and is commonlydone with some kind of anesthetic. Open reduction pri-marily refers to surgery that is performed to realignbones or fragments. Fractures with little or no displace-ment may not require any form of reduction.\nTraction is used to help reposition a broken bone. It\nworks by applying pressure to restore proper alignment.The traction device immobilizes the area and maintainsrealignment as the bone heals. A fractured bone is immo-bilized by applying opposing force at both ends of theinjured area, using an equal amount of traction and coun-tertraction. Weights provide the traction pull needed orthe pull is achieved by positioning the individual’s bodyweight appropriately. Traction is a form of closed reduc-tion and is sometimes used as an alternative to surgery.Since it restricts movement of the affected limb or bodypart, it may confine a person to bed rest for an extendedperiod of time.\nA person may need open reduction if there is an open,\nsevere, or comminuted fracture. This procedure allows aphysician to examine and surgically correct associated softtissue damage while reducing the fracture and, if neces-sary, applying internal or external devices. Internal fixa-tion involves the use of metallic devices inserted into or\nthrough bone to hold the fracture in a set position andalignment while it heals. Devices include plates, nails,screws, and rods. When healing is complete, the surgeonmay or may not remove these devices. Virtually any hipfracture requires open reduction and internal fixation sothat the bone will be able to support the patient’s weight.\nAlternative treatment\nIn addition to the importance of calcium for strong\nbones, many alternative treatment approaches recom-mend use of mineral supplements to help build and main-tain a healthy, resilient skeleton. Some physical thera-pists use electro-stimulation over a fractured site to pro-mote and expedite healing. Chinese traditional medicinemay be helpful by working to reconnect chi through themeridian lines along the line of a fracture. Homeopathy\ncan enhance the body’s healing process. Two particularlyuseful homeopathic remedies are Arnica (Arnica mon-\ntana) and Symphytum (Symphytum officinalis ). If possi-\nble, applying contrast hydrotherapy to an extremity\n(e.g., a hand or foot) of a fractured area can assist healingby enhancing circulation.\nPrognosis\nFractures involving joint surfaces almost always lead\nto some degree of arthritis of the joint. Fractures can nor-mally be cured with proper first aid and appropriate after-care. If determined necessary by a physician, the frac-tured site should be manipulated, realigned, and immobi-lized as soon as possible. Realignment has been shown tobe much more difficult after six hours. Healing timevaries from person to person with the elderly generallyneeding more time to heal completely. A non-union frac-ture may result when a fracture does not heal, such as inthe case of an elderly person or an individual with med-ical complications. Recovery is complete when there is nobone motion at the fracture site, and x rays indicate com-plete healing. Open fractures may lead to bone infections,which delay the healing process. Another possible com-plication is compartment syndrome, a painful conditionresulting from the expansion of enclosed tissue and thatmay occur when a body part is immobilized in a cast.\nPrevention\nAdequate calcium intake is necessary for strong\nbones and can help decrease the risk of fractures. Peoplewho do not get enough calcium in their diets can take a\ncalcium supplement. Exercise can help strengthen bones\nby increasing bone density, thereby decreasing the risk offractures from falls. A University of Southern Californiastudy reported that older people who exercised one or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1365Fracturesmore hours per day had approximately half the incidence\nof hip fractures as those who exercised fewer than 30minutes per day or not at all.\nFractures can be prevented if safety measures are\ntaken seriously. These measures include using seat beltsin cars and encouraging children to wear protectivesports gear. Estrogen replacement for women past theage of 50 has been shown to help prevent osteoporosisand the fractures that may result from this condition. Inone study, elderly women on estrogen replacement thera-py demonstrated the lowest occurrence of hip fractureswhen compared to similar women not on estrogenreplacement therapy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBurr, David B.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPHFragile X syndrome\nDefinition\nFragile X syndrome is the most common form of\ninherited mental retardation . Individuals with this con-\ndition have developmental delay, variable levels of men-tal retardation, and behavioral and emotional difficulties.They may also have characteristic physical traits. Gener-ally, males are affected with moderate mental retardationand females with mild mental retardation.\nDescription\nFragile X syndrome is also known as Martin-Bell syn-\ndrome, Marker X syndrome, and FRAXA syndrome. It isthe most common form of inherited mental retardation.Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR-1gene, located on the X chromosome. The role of the gene isunclear, but it is probably important in early development.\nIn order to understand fragile X syndrome it is\nimportant to understand how human genes and chromo-somes influence this condition. Normally, each cell in thebody contains 46 (23 pairs of) chromosomes. Thesechromosomes consist of genetic material (DNA) neededfor the production of proteins, which lead to growth,development, and physical/intellectual characteristics.The first 22 pairs of chromosomes are the same in malesand females. The remaining two chromosomes are calledthe sex chromosomes (X and Y). The sex chromosomesdetermine whether a person is male or female. Maleshave only one X chromosome, which is inherited fromthe mother at conception, and they receive a Y chromo-some from the father. Females inherit two X chromo-somes, one from each parent. Fragile X syndrome iscaused by a mutation in a gene called FMR-1. This geneis located on the X chromosome. The FMR-1 gene isthought to play an important role in the development ofthe brain, but the exact way that the gene acts in the bodyis not fully understood.\nFragile X syndrome affects males and females of all\nethnic groups. It is estimated that there are about one in4,000 to one in 6,250 males affected with fragile X syn-drome. There are approximately half as many females withfragile X syndrome as there are males. The carrier frequen-cy in unaffected females is one in 100 to one in 600, withone study finding a carrier frequency of one in 250.\nCauses and symptoms\nFor reasons not fully understood, the CGG sequence\nin the FMR-1 gene can expand to contain between 54and 230 repeats. This stage of expansion is called a pre-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1366Fragile X syndromemutation. People who carry a premutation do not usually\nhave symptoms of fragile X syndrome; although therehave been reports of individuals with a premutation andsubtle intellectual or behavioral symptoms. Individualswho carry a fragile X premutation are at risk to have chil-dren or grandchildren with the condition. Female premu-tation carriers may also be at increased risk for earlieronset of menopause ; however, premutation carriers may\nexist through several generations of a family and nosymptoms of fragile X syndrome will appear.\nThe size of the premutation can expand over suc-\nceeding generations. Once the size of the premutationexceeds 230 repeats, it becomes a full mutation and theFMR-1 gene is disabled. Individuals who carry the fullmutation may have fragile X syndrome. Since the FMR-1 gene is located on the X chromosome, males are morelikely to develop symptoms than females. This is becausemales have only one copy of the X chromosome. Maleswho inherit the full mutation are expected to have mentalimpairment. A female’s normal X chromosome maycompensate for her chromosome with the fragile X genemutation. Females who inherit the full mutation have anapproximately 50% risk of mental impairment. The phe-nomenon of an expanding trinucleotide repeat in succes-sive generations is called anticipation. Another uniqueKEY TERMS\nAmniocentesis —A procedure performed at 16-18\nweeks of pregnancy in which a needle is insertedthrough a woman’s abdomen into her uterus todraw out a small sample of the amniotic fluid fromaround the baby. Either the fluid itself or cells fromthe fluid can be used for a variety of tests to obtaininformation about genetic disorders and other med-ical conditions in the fetus.\nCGG or CGG sequence —Shorthand for the DNA\nsequence: cytosine-guanine-guanine. Cytosine andguanine are two of the four molecules, otherwisecalled nucleic acids, that make up DNA.\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS) —A procedure used\nfor prenatal diagnosis at 10-12 weeks gestation.Under ultrasound guidance a needle is insertedeither through the mother’s vagina or abdominal walland a sample of cells is collected from around theearly embryo. These cells are then tested for chromo-some abnormalities or other genetic diseases.\nChromosome —A microscopic thread-like structure\nfound within each cell of the body and consists of acomplex of proteins and DNA.

Mitral valve prolapsemay be detected as a heart murmur but there areusually no symptoms.\nPremutation —A change in a gene that precedes a\nmutation; this change does not alter the function ofthe gene.\nX chromosome —One of the two sex chromo-\nsomes (the other is Y) containing genetic materialthat, among other things, determine a person’sgender.\naspect fragile X syndrome is that mosaicism is present in\n15–20% those affected by the condition. Mosaicism iswhen there is the presence of cells of two different genet-ic materials in the same individual.\nThe mutation involves a short sequence of DNA in\nthe FMR-1 gene. This sequence is designated CGG. Nor-mally, the CGG sequence is repeated between six to 54times. People who have repeats in this range do not havefragile X syndrome and are not at increased risk to havechildren with fragile X syndrome. Those affected by frag-ile X syndrome have expanded CGG repeats (over 200) inthe first exon of the FMR1 gene (the full mutation)\nFragile X syndrome inherited in an X-linked domi-\nnant manner (characters are transmitted by genes on the Xchromosome). When a man carries a premutation on hisX chromosome, it tends to be stable and usually will notexpand if he passes it on to his daughters (he passes his Ychromosome to his sons). Thus, all of his daughters willbe premutation carriers like he is. When a woman carriesa premutation, it is unstable and can expand as she passesit on to her children, therefore a man’s grandchildren areat greater risk of developing the syndrome. There is a50% risk for a premutation carrier female to transmit anabnormal mutation with each pregnancy . The likelihood\nfor the premutation to expand is related to the number of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1367Fragile X syndromerepeats present; the higher the number of repeats, the\ngreater the chance that the premutation will expand to afull mutation in the next generation. All mothers of a childwith a full mutation are carriers of an FMR-1 gene expan-sion. Ninety-nine percent of patients with fragile X syn-drome have a CGG expansion, and less than one percenthave a point mutation or deletion on the FMR1 gene.\nIndividuals with fragile X syndrome appear normal\nat birth but their development is delayed. Most boys withfragile X syndrome have mental impairment. The severi-ty of mental impairment ranges from learning disabilitiesto severe mental retardation. Behavioral problemsinclude attention deficit and hyperactivity at a young age.Some may show aggressive behavior in adulthood. Shortattention span, poor eye contact, delayed and disorderedspeech and language, emotional instability, and unusualhand mannerisms (hand flapping or hand biting) are alsoseen frequently. Characteristic physical traits appear laterin childhood. These traits include a long and narrow face,prominent jaw, large ears, and enlarged testes. In femaleswho carry a full mutation, the physical and behavioralfeatures and mental retardation tend to be less severe.About 50% of females who have a full mutation are men-tally retarded. Other behavioral characteristics includewhirling, spinning, and occasionally autism .\nChildren with fragile X syndrome often have fre-\nquent ear and sinus infections. Nearsightedness and lazyeye are also common. Many babies with fragile X syn-drome may have trouble with sucking and some experi-ence digestive disorders that cause frequent gagging andvomiting. A small percentage of children with fragile Xsyndrome may experience seizures. Children with fragileX syndrome also tend to have loose joints which mayresult in joint dislocations. Some children develop a cur-vature in the spine, flat feet, and a heart condition knownas mitral valve prolapse .\nDiagnosis\nAny child with signs of developmental delay of\nspeech, language, or motor development with no knowncause should be considered for fragile X testing, espe-cially if there is a family history of the condition. Behav-ioral and developmental problems may indicate fragile Xsyndrome, particularly if there is a family history ofmental retardation. Definitive identification of the fragileX syndrome is made by means of a genetic test to assessthe number of CGG sequence repeats in the FMR-1gene. Individuals with the premutation or full mutationmay be identified through genetic testing . Genetic test-\ning for the fragile X mutation can be done on the devel-oping baby before birth through amniocentesis or chori-\nonic villus sampling (CVS), and is 99% effective indetecting the condition due to trinucleotide repeat expan-\nsion. Prenatal testing should only be undertaken after thefragile X carrier status of the parents has been confirmedand the couple has been counseled regarding the risks ofrecurrence. While prenatal testing is possible to do withCVS, the results can be difficult to interpret and addition-al testing may be required.\nTreatment\nPresently there is no cure for fragile X syndrome.\nManagement includes such approaches as speech thera-py, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Theexpertise of psychologists, special education teachers,and genetic counselors may also be beneficial. Drugsmay be used to treat hyperactivity, seizures, and otherproblems. Establishing a regular routine, avoiding overstimulation, and using calming techniques may also helpin the management of behavioral problems. Childrenwith a troubled heart valve may need to see a heart spe-cialist and take medications before surgery or dental pro-cedures. Children with frequent ear and sinus infectionsmay need to take medications or have special tubesplaced in their ears to drain excess fluid. Mainstreamingof children with fragile X syndrome into regular class-rooms is encouraged because they do well imitatingbehavior. Peer tutoring and positive reinforcement arealso encouraged.\nPrognosis\nEarly diagnosis and intensive intervention offer the\nbest prognosis for individuals with fragile X syndrome.Adults with fragile X syndrome may benefit from voca-tional training and may need to live in a supervised set-ting. Life span is typically normal.\nResources\nBOOK\nSutherland, Grant R., and John C. Mulley. “Fragile X Syn-\ndrome.” In Emery and Rimoin’s Principles and Practice\nof Medical Genetics, Ed. David L.

Friedreich’s ataxia is the most common inheritedataxia, affecting between 3,000–5,000 people in the Unit-ed States. FA is an autosomal recessive disease, whichmeans that two defective gene copies must be inherited todevelop symptoms, one from each parent. A person withonly one defective gene copy will not show signs of FA,but may pass along the gene to offspring. Couples withone child affected by FA have a 25% chance in eachpregnancy of conceiving another affected child.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThe gene for FA codes for a protein called frataxin.\nNormal frataxin is found in the cellular energy structuresknown as mitochondria, where it is thought to beinvolved in regulating the transport of iron. In FA, thefrataxin gene on chromosome 9 is expanded with non-sense information known as a “triple repeat.” This extraDNA interferes with normal production of frataxin,thereby impairing iron transport. Normally, there are 10-21 repeats of the frataxin gene. In FA, this sequence maybe repeated between 200-900 times. The types of symp-toms and severity of FA seems to be associated with thenumber of repetitions. Patients with more copies havemore severe symptomatology. Researchers are stillwrestling with how frataxin and the repeats on chromo-some 9 are involved in causing FA. One theory suggeststhat FA develops in part because defects in iron transportprevent efficient use of cellular energy supplies.\nThe nerve cells most affected by FA are those in the\nspinal cord involved in relaying information betweenmuscles and the brain. Tight control of movementrequires complex feedback between the muscles promot-ing a movement, those restraining it, and the brain. With-out this control, movements become uncoordinated,jerky, and inappropriate to the desired action.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of FA usually first appear between the\nages of 8 and 15, although onset as early as 18 months oras late as age 25 is possible. The first symptom is usuallygait incoordination. A child with FA may graze doorwayswhen passing through, for instance, or trip over lowobstacles. Unsteadiness when standing still and deterio-ration of position sense is common. Foot deformities andwalking up off the heels often results from uneven mus-cle weakness in the legs. Muscle spasms and cramps\nmay occur, especially at night.\nAtaxia in the arms follows, usually within several\nyears, leading to decreased hand-eye coordination. Armweakness does not usually occur until much later. Speechand swallowing difficulties are common. Diabetes melli-\ntusmay also occur. Nystagmus , or eye tremor, is com-\nmon, along with some loss of visual acuity. Hearing loss\nmay also occur. A side-to-side curvature of the spine ( sco-\nliosis ) occurs in many cases, and may become severe.\nHeartbeat abnormalities occur in about two thirds of\nFA patients, leading to shortness of breath after exer-\ntion, swelling in the lower limbs, and frequent com-plaints of cold feet.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of FA involves a careful medical history\nand thorough neurological exam. Lab tests include elec-\ntromyography , an electrical test of muscle, and a nerve\nconduction velocity test. An electrocardiogram may beperformed to diagnose heart arrhythmia.\nDirect DNA testing is available, allowing FA to be\nmore easily distinguished from other types of ataxia. Thesame test may be used to determine the presence of thegenetic defect in unaffected individuals, such as siblings.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1369Friedreich’s ataxiaTreatment\nThere is no cure for FA, nor any treatment that can\nslow its progress. Amantadine may provide some limitedimprovement in ataxic symptoms, but is not recommendedin patients with cardiac abnormalities. Physical and occupa-tional therapy are used to maintain range of motion in weak-ened muscles, and to design adaptive techniques anddevices to compensate for loss of coordination and strength.Some patients find that using weights on the arms can helpdampen the worst of the uncoordinated arm movements.\nHeart arrhythmias and diabetes are treated with\ndrugs specific to those conditions.\nPrognosis\nThe rate of progression of FA is highly variable. Most\npatients lose the ability to walk within 15 years of symp-tom onset, and 95% require a wheelchair for mobility byage 45. Reduction in lifespan from FA complications isalso quite variable. Average age at death is in the mid-thir-\nties, but may be as late as the mid-sixties. As of mid-1998,the particular length of the triple repeat has not been corre-lated strongly enough with disease progression to allowprediction of the course of the disease on this basis.\nPrevention\nThere is no way to prevent development of FA in a\nperson carrying two defective gene copies.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFeldman, Eva L. “Hereditary Cerebellar Ataxias and Related\nDisorders.” In Cecil Textbook of Medicine , ed.

Frostnip is a mild form ofcold injury.\nDescription\nIn North America, frostbite is largely confined to\nAlaska, Canada, and the northern states. Recent yearshave witnessed a substantial decline in the number ofcases, probably for several reasons, including better win-ter clothing and footwear and greater public understand-ing of how to avoid cold-weather dangers. At the sametime, the nature of the at-risk population has changed asrising numbers of homeless people have made frostbitean urban as well as a rural public health concern. Thegrowing popularity of outdoor winter activities has alsoexpanded the at-risk population.\nCauses and symptoms\nFrostbite\nSkin exposed to temperatures a little below the\nfreezing mark can take hours to freeze, but very cold skincan freeze in minutes or seconds. Air temperature, windspeed, and moisture all affect how cold the skin becomes.A strong wind can lower skin temperature considerablyby dispersing the thin protective layer of warm air thatsurrounds our bodies. Wet clothing readily draws heataway from the skin because water is a potent conductorof heat. The evaporation of moisture on the skin also pro-duces cooling. For these reasons, wet skin or clothing ona windy day can lead to frostbite even if the air tempera-ture is above the freezing mark.\nThe extent of permanent injury, however, is deter-\nmined not by how cold the skin and the underlying tis-sues become but by how long they remain frozen. Conse-quently, homeless people and others whose self-preser-vation instincts may be clouded by alcohol or psychiatricillness face a greater risk of frostbite-related amputation\nbecause they are more likely to stay out in the cold whenprudence dictates seeking shelter or medical attention.Alcohol also affects blood circulation in the extremitiesin a way that can increase the severity of injury (as doessmoking ). A review of 125 Saskatchewan frostbite cases\nfound a tie to alcohol in 46% and to psychiatric illness in17%. Other risk factors identified by researchers includeinadequate clothing, previous cold injury, fatigue ,\nwound infection, atherosclerosis (an arterial disease),\nand diabetes. Driving in poor weather can also be dan-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1370Frostbite and frostnipgerous: vehicular failure was a predisposing factor in\n15% of the Saskatchewan cases.\nThree nearly simultaneous physiological processes\nunderlie frostbite injury: tissue freezing, tissue hypoxia, andthe release of inflammatory mediators. Tissue freezingcauses ice crystal formation and other changes that damageand eventually kill cells. Much of this harm occurs becausethe ice produces pressure changes that cause water (crucialfor cell survival) to flow out of the cells. Tissue hypoxia(oxygen deficiency) occurs when the blood vessels in thehands, feet, and other extremities narrow in response tocold. Among its many tasks, blood transfers body heat to theskin, which then dissipates the heat into the environment.Blood vessel narrowing is the body’s way of protecting vitalinternal organs at the expense of the extremities by reducingheat flow away from the core. However, blood also carrieslife-sustaining oxygen to the skin and other tissues, and nar-rowed vessels result in oxygen starvation . Narrowing also\ncauses acidosis (an increase in tissue acidity) and increasesblood viscosity (thickness). Ultimately, blood stops flowingthrough the capillaries (the tiny blood vessels that connectthe arteries and veins) and blood clots form in the arteriolesand venules (the smallest arteries and veins). Damage alsooccurs to the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.Hypoxia, blood clots, and endothelial damage lead, in turn,to the release of inflammatory mediators (substances thatact as links in the inflammatory process), which promotefurther endothelial damage, hypoxia, and cell destruction.\nFrostbite is classified by degree of injury (first, sec-\nond, third, or fourth), or simply divided into two types,superficial (corresponding to first- or second-degreeinjury) and deep (corresponding to third- or fourth-degreeinjury). Most frostbite injuries affect the feet or hands. Theremaining 10% of cases typically involve the ears, nose,cheeks, or penis. Once frostbite sets in, the affected partbegins to feel cold and, usually, numb; this is followed bya feeling of clumsiness. The skin turns white or yellowish.Many patients experience severe pain in the affected part\nduring rewarming treatment and an intense throbbing painthat arises two or three days later and can last days orweeks. As the skin begins to thaw during treatment,edema (excess tissue fluid) often accumulates, causing\nswelling. In second- and higher-degree frostbite, blistersappear. Third-degree cases produce deep, blood-filled blis-ters and, during the second week, a hard black eschar(scab). Fourth-degree frostbite penetrates below the skin tothe muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones. In severe cases offrostbite the dead tissue can mummify and drop off. Infec-tion is also a possibility.\nFrostnip\nLike frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal\nformation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs andthe crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed. Frostnip\naffects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose, fingers, andtoes. The skin turns pale and one experiences numbness ortingling in the affected part until warming begins.\nDiagnosis\nFrostbite diagnosis relies on a physical examina-\ntion and may also include conventional radiography (x\nrays), angiography (x-ray examination of the blood ves-\nsels using an injected dye to provide contrast), thermog-raphy (use of a heat-sensitive device for measuring bloodflow), and other techniques for predicting the course ofinjury and identifying tissue that requires surgicalremoval. During the initial treatment period, however, aphysician cannot judge how a case will progress. Diag-nostic tests only become useful three to five days afterrewarming, once the blood vessels have stabilized.\nTreatment\nFrostbite\nEmergency medical help should always be sum-\nmoned whenever frostbite is suspected. While waiting forhelp to arrive, one should, if possible, remove wet or tightclothing and put on dry, loose clothing or wraps. A splintand padding are used to protect the injured area. Rubbingthe area with snow or anything else is dangerous. The keyto prehospital treatment is to avoid partial thawing andrefreezing, which releases more inflammatory mediatorsand makes the injury substantially worse. For this reason,the affected part must be kept away from heat sources suchas campfires and car heaters. Experts advise rewarming inthe field only when emergency help will take more thantwo hours to arrive and refreezing can be prevented.\nBecause the outcome of a frostbite injury cannot be\npredicted at first, all hospital treatment follows the same\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1371Frostbite and frostnip\nA human hand with frostbite. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Repro-\nduced by permission.)route. Treatment begins by rewarming the affected part\nfor 15–30 minutes in water at a temperature of104–108°F (40–42.2°C). This rapid rewarming halts icecrystal formation and dilates narrowed blood vessels.Aloe vera (which acts against inflammatory mediators) isapplied to the affected part, which is then splinted, ele-vated, and wrapped in a dressing. Depending on theextent of injury, blisters may be debrided (cleaned byremoving foreign material) or simply covered with aloevera. A tetanus shot and, possibly, penicillin, are used to\nprevent infection, and the patient is given ibuprofen tocombat inflammation. Narcotics are needed in mostcases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs as sen-sation returns during rewarming. Except when injury isminimal, treatment generally requires a hospital stay ofseveral days, during which hydrotherapy and physical\ntherapy are used to restore the affected part to health.Experts recommend a cautious approach to tissueremoval, and advise that 22–45 days must pass before adecision on amputation can safely be made.\nFrostnip\nFrostnipped fingers are helped by blowing warm air\non them or holding them under one’s armpits. Otherfrostnipped areas can be covered with warm hands. Theinjured areas should never be rubbed.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative practitioners suggest several kinds of\ntreatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving thehospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or usingcontrast hydrotherapy can help enhance circulation. Con-trast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold waterapplications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient canstand) is applied to the affected area for three minutes fol-lowed by an ice cold compress for 30 seconds. Theseapplications are repeated three times each, ending with thecold compress. Nutritional therapy to promote tissuegrowth in damaged areas may also be helpful. Homeo-pathic and botanical therapies may also assist recoveryfrom frostbite. Homeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum per-\nforatum ) is recommended when nerve ending are affected\n(especially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica\nmontana ) is prescribed for shock . Cayenne pepper ( Cap-\nsicum frutescens ) can enhance circulation and relieve pain.\nDrinking hot ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) tea also aids cir-\nculation. Other possible approaches include acupuncture\nto avoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy.\nPrognosis\nThe rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment,\npioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much moreeffective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and\namputation. A study of 56 first-, second-, and third-degreefrostbite patients treated with rapid rewarming in1982–85 found that 68% recovered without tissue loss,25% experienced some tissue loss, and 7% needed ampu-tation. In a comparison group of 98 patients, treatmentusing older methods resulted in a tissue loss rate of nearly35% and an amputation rate of nearly 33%. Although thecomparison group included a higher proportion of sec-ond- and third-degree cases, the difference in treatmentresults was determined to be statistically significant.\nThe extreme throbbing pain that many frostbite suf-\nferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is notthe only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the firstweeks or months, people often experience tingling, aburning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks froman electric current. Other possible consequences of frost-bite include skin—color changes, nail deformation orloss, joint stiffness and pain, hyperhidrosis (excessive\nsweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every-one, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years—and sometimes a lifetime—is inevitable.\nPrevention\nWith the appropriate knowledge and precautions,\nfrostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and mostchallenging environments. Appropriate clothing andfootwear are essential. To prevent heat loss and keep theblood circulating properly, clothing should be wornloosely and in layers. Covering the hands, feet, and headis also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garmentsneed to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing andfootwear must be replaced as quickly as possible. Alco-hol and drugs should be avoided because of their harmfuleffects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also warnagainst alcohol use and smoking in the cold because ofthe circulatory changes they produce. Paying close atten-tion to the weather report before venturing outdoors andavoiding unnecessary risks such as driving in isolatedareas during a blizzard are also important.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBurton Goldberg Group.
