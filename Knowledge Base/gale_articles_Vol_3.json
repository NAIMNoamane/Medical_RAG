    "content": "Galactosemia\nDefinition\nGalactosemia is an inherited disease in which the\ntransformation of galactose to glucose is blocked, allow-ing galactose to increase to toxic levels in the body. Ifgalactosemia is untreated, high levels of galactose causevomiting, diarrhea , lethargy, low blood sugar, brain\ndamage, jaundice , liver enlargement, cataracts , suscep-\ntibility to infection, and death .\nDescription\nGalactosemia is a rare but potentially life-threaten-\ning disease that results from the inability to metabolizegalactose. Serious consequences from galactosemia canbe prevented by screening newborns at birth with a sim-ple blood test.\nGalactosemia is an inborn error of metabolism.\n“Metabolism” refers to all chemical reactions that take\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1376Galactosemiaplace in living organisms. A metabolic pathway is a series\nof reactions where the product of each step in the series isthe starting material for the next step. Enzymes are thechemicals that help the reactions occur. Their ability tofunction depends on their structure, and their structure isdetermined by the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)sequence of the genes that encode them. Inborn errors ofmetabolism are caused by mutations in these genes whichdo not allow the enzymes to function properly.\nSugars are sometimes called “the energy mole-\ncules,” and galactose and glucose are both sugars. Forgalactose to be utilized for energy, it must be trans-formed into something that can enter the metabolic path-way that converts glucose into energy (plus water andcarbon dioxide). This is important for infants becausethey typically get most of their nutrient energy frommilk, which contains a high level of galactose. Eachmolecule of lactose, the major sugar constituent of milk,is made up of a molecule of galactose and a molecule ofglucose, and so galactose makes up 20% of the energysource of a typical infant’s diet.\nThree enzymes are required to convert galactose into\nglucose-1-phosphate (a phosphorylated glucose that canenter the metabolic pathway that turns glucose into ener-gy). Each of these three enzymes is encoded by a sepa-rate gene. If any of these enzymes fail to function, galac-tose build-up and galactosemia result. Thus, there arethree types of galactosemia with a different gene respon-sible for each.\nEvery cell in a person’s body has two copies of\neach gene. Each of the forms of galactosemia is inherit-ed as a recessive trait, which means that galactosemia isonly present in individuals with two mutated copies ofone of the three genes. This also means that carriers,with only one copy of a gene mutation, will not beaware that they are carrying a mutation (unless theyhave had a genetic test), as it is masked by the normalgene they also carry and they have no symptoms of thedisease. For each step in the conversion of galactose toglucose, if only one of the two copies of the gene con-trolling that step is normal (i.e. for carriers), enoughfunctional enzyme is made so that the pathway is notblocked at that step. If a person has galactosemia, bothcopies of the gene coding for one of the enzymesrequired to convert glucose to galactose are defectiveand the pathway becomes blocked. If two carriers of thesame defective gene have children, the chance of any oftheir children getting galactosemia (the chance of achild getting two copies of the defective gene) is 25%(one in four) for each pregnancy .\nClassic galactosemia occurs in the United States\nabout one in every 50,000–70,000 live births.Causes and symptoms\nGalactosemia I\nGalactosemia I (also called classic galactosemia),\nthe first form to be discovered, is caused by defects inboth copies of the gene that codes for an enzyme calledgalactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). Thereare 30 known different mutations in this gene that causeGALT to malfunction.\nNewborns with galactosemia I appear normal at\nbirth, but begin to develop symptoms after they are givenmilk for the first time. Symptoms include vomiting, diar-rhea, lethargy (sluggishness or fatigue ), low blood glu-\ncose, jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and eyes),enlarged liver, protein and amino acids in the urine, andsusceptibility to infection, especially from gram negativebacteria. Cataracts (a grayish white film on the eye lens)can appear within a few days after birth. People withgalactosemia frequently have symptoms as they growolder even though they have been given a galactose-freediet. These symptoms include speech disorders ,\ncataracts, ovarian atrophy and infertility in females,\nlearning disabilities, and behavioral problems.\nGalactosemia II\nGalactosemia II is caused by defects in both copies\nof the gene that codes for an enzyme called galactokinase(GALK). The frequency of occurrence of galactosemia IIis about one in 100,000–155,000 births.\nGalactosemia II is less harmful than galactosemia I.\nBabies born with galactosemia II will develop cataractsat an early age unless they are given a galactose-free diet.They do not generally suffer from liver damage or neuro-logic disturbances.\nGalactosemia III\nGalactosemia III is caused by defects in the gene\nthat codes for an enzyme called uridyl diphosphogalac-tose-4-epimerase (GALE). This form of galactosemia isvery rare.\nThere are two forms of galactosemia III, a severe\nform, which is exceedingly rare, and a benign form. Thebenign form has no symptoms and requires no specialdiet. However, newborns with galactosemia III, includingthe benign form, have high levels of galactose-1-phos-phate that show up on the initial screenings for elevatedgalactose and galactose-1-phosphate. This situation illus-trates one aspect of the importance of follow-up enzymefunction tests. Tests showing normal levels of GALT andGALK allow people affected by the benign form ofgalactosemia III to enjoy a normal diet.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1377GalactosemiaThe severe form has symptoms similar to those of\ngalactosemia I, but with more severe neurological prob-lems, including seizures. Only two cases of this rare formhad been reported as of 1997.\nDiagnosis\nThe newborn screening test for classic galactosemia\nis quick and straightforward; all but three states requiretesting on all newborns. Blood from a baby who is two tothree days old is usually first screened for high levels ofgalactose and galactose-1-phosphate. If either of thesecompounds is elevated, further tests are performed tofind out which enzymes (GALT, GALK, or GALE) arepresent or missing. DNA testing may also be performedto confirm the diagnosis.KEY TERMS\nCasein hydrolysate —A preparation made from the\nmilk protein casein, which is hydrolyzed to breakit down into its constituent amino acids. Aminoacids are the building blocks of proteins.\nCatalyst —A substance that changes the rate of a\nchemical reaction, but is not physically changedby the process.\nEnzyme —A protein that catalyzes a biochemical\nreaction or change without changing its ownstructure or function.\nGalactose —One of the two simple sugars, togeth-\ner with glucose, that makes up the protein, lac-tose, found in milk. Galactose can be toxic in highlevels.\nGlucose —One of the two simple sugars, together\nwith galactose, that makes up the protein, lactose,found in milk. Glucose is the form of sugar that isusable by the body to generate energy.\nLactose —A sugar made up of of glucose and\ngalactose. It is the primary sugar in milk.\nMetabolic pathway —A sequence of chemical\nreactions that lead from some precursor to a prod-uct, where the product of each step in the series isthe starting material for the next step.\nMetabolism —The total combination of all of the\nchemical processes that occur within cells and tis-sues of a living body.\nRecessive trait —An inherited trait or characteristic\nthat is outwardly obvious only when two copies ofthe gene for that trait are present.If there is a strong suspicion that a baby has galac-\ntosemia, galactose is removed from their diet right away.In this case, an initial screen for galactose or galactose-1-phosphate will be meaningless. In the absence of galac-tose in the diet, this test will be negative whether thebaby has galactosemia or not. In this case, tests to mea-sure enzyme levels must be given to find out if the sus-pected baby is indeed galactosemic.\nIn addition, galactosemic babies who are refusing\nmilk or vomiting will not have elevated levels of galac-tose or galactose phosphate, and their condition will notbe detected by the initial screen. Any baby with symp-toms of galactosemia (for example, vomiting) should begiven enzyme tests.\nTreatment\nGalactosemia I and II are treated by removing galac-\ntose from the diet. Since galactose is a break-down prod-uct of lactose, the primary sugar constituent of milk, thismeans all milk and foods containing milk products mustbe totally eliminated. Other foods like legumes, organmeats, and processed meats also contain considerablegalactose and must be avoided. Pills that use lactose as afiller must also be avoided. Soy-based and caseinhydrolysate-based formulas are recommended for infantswith galactosemia.\nTreatment of the severe form of galactosemia III\nwith a galactose-restricted diet has been tried, but thisdisorder is so rare that the long-term effects of this treat-ment are unknown.\nPrognosis\nEarly detection in the newborn period is the key to\ncontrolling symptoms. Long-term effects in untreatedbabies include severe mental retardation ,cirrhosis of\nthe liver, and death. About 75% of the untreated babiesdie within the first two weeks of life. On the other hand,with treatment, a significant proportion of people withgalactosemia I can lead nearly normal lives, althoughspeech defects, learning disabilities, and behavioralproblems are common. In addition, cataracts due togalactosemia II can be completely prevented by a galac-tose-free diet.\nPrevention\nSince galactosemia is a recessive genetic disease, the\ndisease is usually detected on a newborn screening test,since most people are unaware that they are carriers of agene mutation causing the disease. For couples with aprevious child with galactosemia, prenatal diagnosis isavailable to determine whether a pregnancy is similarly\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1378Galactosemiaaffected. Families in which a child has been diagnosed\nwith galactosemia can have DNA testing which canenable other more distant relatives to determine their car-rier status. Prospective parents can then use that informa-tion to conduct family planning or to prepare for a childwith special circumstances. Children born with galac-tosemia should be put on a special diet right away, toreduce the symptoms and complications of the disease.\nResources\nBOOKS\nNg, Won G., Thomas F. Roe, and George N.

    "title": "Gallbladder cancer",
    "content": "Gallbladder cancer\nDefinition\nCancer of the gallbladder is cancer of the pear-\nshaped organ that lies on the undersurface of the liver.\nDescription\nBile from the liver is funneled into the gallbladder\nby way of the cystic duct. Between meals, the gallblad-der stores a large amount of bile. To do this, it mustabsorb much of the water and electrolytes from the bile.In fact, the inner surface of the gallbladder is the mostabsorptive surface in the body. After a meal, the gallblad-der’s muscular walls contract to deliver the bile backthrough the cystic duct and eventually into the smallintestine, where the bile can help digest food.Demographics\nAbout 5,000 people are diagnosed with gallbladder\ncancer each year in the United States, making it the fifthmost common gastrointestinal cancer. It is more commonin females than males and most patients are elderly.Southwest American Indians have a particularly highincidence—six times that of the general population.\nCauses and symptoms\nGallstones are the most significant risk factor for\nthe development of gallbladder cancer. Roughly 75 to 90percent of patients with gallbladder cancer also havegallstones. Larger gallstones are associated with a higherchance of developing gallbladder cancer. Chronicinflammation of the gallbladder from infection alsoincreases the risk for gallbladder cancer.\nUnfortunately, sometimes cancer of the gallbladder\ndoes not produce symptoms until late in the disease.When symptoms are evident, the most common is pain\nin the upper right portion of the abdomen, underneath theright ribcage. Patients with gallbladder cancer may alsoreport symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness,jaundice , skin itching ,fever , chills, poor appetite, and\nweight loss.\nDiagnosis\nGallbladder cancer is often misdiagnosed because it\nmimics other more common conditions, such as gall-stones, cholecystitis , and pancreatitis . But the imaging\ntests that are utilized to evaluate these other conditionscan also detect gallbladder cancer. For example, ultra-sound is a quick, noninvasive imaging test that reliablydiagnoses gallstones and cholecystitis. It can also detectthe presence of gallbladder cancer as well as show howfar the cancer has spread. If cancer is suspected, a com-puted tomography scan is useful in confirming the pres-ence of an abnormal mass and further demonstrating thesize and extent of the tumor. Cholangiography, usuallyperformed to evaluate a patient with jaundice, can alsodetect gallbladder cancer.\nThere are no specific laboratory tests for gallbladder\ncancer. Tumors can obstruct the normal flow of bile fromthe liver to the small intestine. Bilirubin, a component ofbile, builds up within the liver and is absorbed into thebloodstream in excess amounts. This can be detected in ablood test, but it can also manifest clinically as jaundice.Elevated bilirubin levels and clinical jaundice can alsooccur with other conditions, such as gallstones.\nOn occasion, gallbladder cancer is diagnosed inci-\ndentally. About one percent of all patients who have theirgallbladder removed for symptomatic gallstones are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1379Gallbladder cancerfound to have gallbladder cancer. The cancer is found\neither by the surgeon or by the pathologist who inspectsthe gallbladder with a microscope.\nTreatment\nStaging of gallbladder cancer is determined by the\nhow far the cancer has spread. The effectiveness oftreatment declines as the stage progresses. Stage I can-cer is confined to the wall of the gallbladder. Approxi-mately 25% of cancers are at this stage at the time ofdiagnosis. Stage II cancer has penetrated the full thick-ness of the wall, but has not spread to nearby lymphnodes or invaded adjacent organs. Stage III cancer hasspread to nearby lymph nodes or has invaded the liver,stomach, colon, small intestine, or large intestine. StageIV disease has invaded very deeply into two or moreadjacent organs or has spread to distant lymph nodes ororgans by way of metastasis.\nEarly Stage I cancers involving only the innermost\nlayer of the gallbladder wall can be cured by simpleremoval of the gallbladder. Cancers at this stage aresometimes found incidentally when the gallbladder isremoved in the treatment of gallstones or cholecystitis.The majority of patients have good survival rates. LateStage I cancers, which involve the outer muscular layersof the gallbladder wall, are generally treated in the sameway as Stage II or III cancers. Removal of the gallblad-KEY TERMS\nCholangiography —Radiographic examination of\nthe bile ducts after injection with a special dye\nCholecystitis —Inflammation of the gallbladder,\nusually due to infection\nComputed tomography —A radiology test by\nwhich images of cross-sectional planes of thebody are obtained\nJaundice —Yellowish staining of the skin and eyes\ndue to excess bilirubin in the bloodstream\nMetastasis —The spread of tumor cells from one\npart of the body to another through blood vesselsor lymphatic vessels\nPancreatitis —Inflammation of the pancreas\nStent —Slender hollow catheter or rod placed\nwithin a vessel or duct to provide support or main-tain patency\nUltrasound —A radiology test utilizing high fre-\nquency sound wavesder is not sufficient for these stages. The surgeon also\nremoves nearby lymph nodes as well as a portion of theadjacent liver (radical surgery). Survival rates for thesepatients are considerably worse than for those with earlyStage I disease. Patients with early Stage IV disease maybenefit from radical surgery, but the issue is controver-sial. Late Stage IV cancer has spread too extensively toallow complete excision. Surgery is not an option forthese patients.\nOther therapies\nWhen long-term survival is not likely, the focus of\ntherapy shifts to improving quality of life. Jaundice andblockage of the stomach are two problems faced bypatients with advanced cancer of the gallbladder. Thesecan be treated with surgery, or alternatively, by specialinterventional techniques employed by the gastroenterol-ogist or radiologist. A stent can be placed across the bileducts in order to re-establish the flow of bile and relievejaundice. A small feeding tube can be placed in the smallintestine to allow feeding when the stomach is blocked.Pain may be treated with conventional pain medicines ora celiac ganglion nerve block.\nCurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy can-\nnot cure gallbladder cancer, but they may offer somebenefit in certain patients. For cancer that is tooadvanced for surgical cure, treatment with chemothera-peutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil may lengthen sur-vival for a few months. The limited benefit of chemother-apy must be weighed carefully against its side effects.Radiation therapy is sometimes used after attempted sur-gical resection of the cancer to extend survival for a fewmonths or relieve jaundice.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAhrendt, Steven A. and Henry A.

The proce-dure uses a small amount of radioactive dye which isinjected into the body. The dye accumulates in the organ,in this case, the gallbladder. A special camera called ascintillation or gamma camera produces images based onhow the dye travels through the system and how the radi-ation is absorbed by the tissues. The procedure is alsocalled cholescintigraphy or a hepatobiliary scan.\nPurpose\nA nuclear medicine scan can be used to diagnose\ndisease and to find abnormalities in a body organ. A gall-bladder scan can detect gallstones , tumors, or defects of\nthe gallbladder. It can also be used to diagnose blockagesof the bile duct that leads from the gallbladder to thesmall intestine. Unlike ultrasound, a gallbladder nuclearmedicine scan can assess gallbladder function.\nPrecautions\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding should\ntell their doctors before a scan is performed. Some med-ications or even eating a high fat meal before the proce-dure can interfere with the results of the scan.\nDescription\nThe gallbladder is a small pear-shaped sac located\nunder the liver. The liver produces bile, a yellowish-green mixture of salts, acids, and other chemicals, thatare stored in the gallbladder. Bile is secreted into thesmall intestine to help the body digest fats from foods.\nGallbladder disease, gallstones, cancer , or other\nabnormalities can cause pain and other symptoms. A\ngallbladder condition might be suspected if a patient haschronic or occasional pain in the upper right side of theabdomen. The pain may be stabbing and intense withsudden onset or it may be more of a dull, occasionalache. Loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting can also\noccur. Fever may indicate the presence of infection.\nJaundice , a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes,\nmay also indicate that the gallbladder is involved.\nA gallbladder nuclear medicine scan may be used to\ndiagnose gallstones, blockage of the bile duct or otherabnormalities, and to assess gallbladder functioning andinflammation ( cholecystitis ).

This dye circulates through the blood and collects inthe gallbladder. As the dye moves through the gallblad-der, a series of pictures is taken using a special cameracalled a scintillation or gamma camera . This procedure\nproduces images that look like x rays. The test usuallytakes one to two hours to complete, but can last up tofour hours.\nThe results of the scan are read by a radiologist, a\ndoctor specializing in x rays and other types of scanningtechniques.

    "title": "Gallbladder x rays",
    "content": "Gallbladder x rays\nDefinition\nThis is an x-ray exam of the gallbladder (GB), a sac-\nlike organ that stores bile that is located under the liver.The study involves taking tablets containing dye (con-trast) which outline any abnormalities when x rays aretaken the following day. The test was once the standardfor diagnosing diseases of the GB such as gallstones ,b u t\nis used less frequently now. This is due to advances indiagnostic ultrasound, which is quick, accurate and does-n’t involve exposure to ionizing radiation. When func-tional parameters of the gallbladder need to be demon-strated, scintigraphy is now the study of choice. OCG,however, can be useful when a gallbladder is contracteddown due to the presence of many, many gallstones. Itcan also help determine whether the cystic duct is clear,prior to surgical procedures such as lithotripsy . OCG\nmay also be used to evaluate gallbladder disease thatdoesn’t involve gallstones, such as adenomyomatosis ofthe gallbladder or cholesterolosis of the gallbladder.Purpose\nThis test, also known as an oral cholecystogram or\nOCG, is usually ordered to help physicians diagnosedisorders of the gallbladder, such as gallstones andtumors, which show up as solid dark structures. It is per-formed to help in the investigation of patients with upperabdominal pain . The test also measures gallbladder\nfunction, as the failure of the organ to visualize can sig-nify a non-functioning or diseased gallbladder. The gall-bladder may also not visualize if the bilirubin level isover 4 and the study should not be performed underthese circumstances.\nPrecautions\nYour physician must be notified if you are pregnant\nor allergic to iodine. Patients with a history of severe kid-ney damage, have an increased risk of injury or sideeffects from the procedure. In those cases, ultrasound iscommonly used instead of the x-ray examination. Somepeople experience side effects from the contrast material(dye tablets), especially diarrhea . During preparation\nfor the test, patients should not use any laxatives . Dia-\nbetics should discuss the need for any adjustment inmedication with their physician.\nDescription\nThe exam is performed in the radiology department.\nThe night before the test, patients swallow six tablets (oneat a time) that contain the contrast (x-ray dye). The follow-ing day at the hospital, the radiologist examines the gall-bladder with a fluoroscope (a special x ray that projectsthe image onto a video monitor). Sometimes, patients arethen asked to drink a highfat formula that will cause thegallbladder to contract and release bile. X rays will then betaken at various intervals. There is no discomfort from thetest. If the gallbladder is not seen, the patient may be askedto return the following day for x rays.\nPreparation\nThe day before the test patients are instructed to eat\na high fat lunch (eggs, butter, milk, salad oils, or fattymeats), and a fat-free meal (fruits, vegetables, bread, teaor coffee, and only lean meat) in the evening. Two hoursafter the evening meal, six tablets containing the contrastmedium, are taken, one a time. After that, no food orfluid is permitted until after the test.\nAftercare\nNo special care is required after the study.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1382Gallbladder x raysRisks\nThere is a small chance of an allergic reaction to the\ncontrast material. In addition, there is low radiation expo-sure. X rays are monitored and regulated to provide theminimum amount of radiation exposure needed to producethe image. Most experts feel that the risk is low comparedwith the benefits. Pregnant women and children are moresensitive to the risks of x rays, and the risk versus benefitsshould be discussed with the treating physician.\nNormal results\nThe x ray will show normal structures for the age of\nthe patient. The gallbladder should visualize, and be freeof any solid structures, such as stones, polyps, etc.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal results may show gallstones, tumors, or\ncholesterol polyps (a tumor growing from the lining thatis usually noncancerous).

    "title": "Gallium scan of the body",
    "content": "Gallium scan of the body\nDefinition\nA gallium scan of the body is a nuclear medicine test\nthat is conducted using a camera that detects gallium, aform of radionuclide, or radioactive chemical substance.\nPurpose\nMost gallium scans are ordered to detect cancerous\ntumors, infections, or areas of inflammation in the body.Gallium is known to accumulate in inflamed, infected, orcancerous tissues. The scans are used to determinewhether a patient with an unexplained fever has an infec-\ntion and the site of the infection, if present. Galliumscans also may be used to evaluate cancer following\nchemotherapy or radiation therapy .\nPrecautions\nChildren and women who are pregnant or breast-\nfeeding are only given gallium scans if the potentialdiagnostic benefits will outweigh the risks.\nDescription\nThe patient will usually be asked to come to the test-\ning facility 24–48 hours before the procedure to receivethe injection of gallium. Sometimes, the injection will begiven only four to six hours before the study or as long as72 hours before the procedure. The timeframe is basedon the area or organs of the body being studied.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1383Gallium scan of the bodyFor the study itself the patient lies very still for\napproximately 30–60 minutes. A camera is moved acrossthe patient’s body to detect and capture images of con-centrations of the gallium. The camera picks up signalsfrom any accumulated areas of the radionuclide. In mostcases, the patient is lying down throughout the proce-dure. Back (posterior) and front (anterior) views willusually be taken, and sometimes a side (lateral) view isused. The camera may occasionally touch the patient’sskin, but will not cause any discomfort. A clicking noisemay be heard throughout the procedure; this is only thesound of the scanner registering radiation.\nPreparation\nThe intravenous injection of gallium is done in a\nseparate appointment prior to the procedure. Generally,no special dietary requirements are necessary. Some-times the physician will ask that the patient have lightor clear meals within a day or less of the procedure.Many patients will be given laxatives or an enema\nprior to the scan to eliminate any residual gallium fromthe bowels.\nAftercare\nThere is generally no aftercare required following a\ngallium scan. However, women who are breastfeedingwho have a scan will be cautioned against breastfeedingfor four weeks following the exam.Risks\nThere is a minimal risk of exposure to radiation\nfrom the gallium injection, but the exposure from onegallium scan is generally less than exposure from x rays.\nNormal results\nA radiologist trained in nuclear medicine or a\nnuclear medicine specialist will interpret the examresults and compare them to other diagnostic tests. It isnormal for gallium to accumulate in the liver, spleen,bones, breast tissue, and large bowel.\nAbnormal results\nAn abnormal concentration of gallium in areas other\nthan those where it normally concentrates may indicatethe presence of disease. Concentrations may be due toinflammation, infection, or the presence of tumor tissue.Often, additional tests are required to determine if thetumors are malignant (cancerous) or benign.\nEven though gallium normally concentrates in\norgans such as the liver or spleen, abnormally high con-centrations will suggest certain diseases and conditions.For example, Hodgkin’s or non-Hodgkin’s lymphomamay be diagnosed or staged if there is abnormal galliumactivity in the lymph nodes. After a patient receives can-cer treatment, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy,a gallium scan may help to find new or recurring tumorsor to record regression of a treated tumor. Physicians cannarrow causes of liver problems by noting abnormal gal-lium activity in the liver. Gallium scans also may be usedto diagnose lung diseases or a disease called sarcoidosis ,\nin the chest.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFischbach, Frances T. A Manual of Laboratory and Diagnostic\nTests.

    "title": "Gallstone removal",
    "content": "Gallstone removal\nDefinition\nAlso known as cholelithotomy, gallstone removal is\nthe medical procedure that rids the gallbladder of calcu-lus buildup.\nPurpose\nThe gallbladder is not a vital organ. Its function is to\nstore bile, concentrate it, and release it during digestion.Bile is supposed to retain all of its chemicals in solution,but commonly one of them crystallizes and forms sand,gravel, and finally stones.KEY TERMS\nBenign —Not cancerous. Benign tumors are not\nconsidered immediate threats, but may stillrequire some form of treatment.\nGallium —A form of radionuclide that is used to\nhelp locate tumors and inflammation (specificallyreferred to as GA67 citrate).\nMalignant —This term, usually used to describe a\ntumor, means cancerous, becoming worse andpossibly growing.\nNuclear medicine —A subspecialty of radiology\nused to show the function and anatomy of bodyorgans. Very small amounts of radioactive sub-stances, or tracers, are detected with a specialcamera as they accumulate in certain organs andtissues.\nRadionuclide —A chemical substance, called an\nisotope, that exhibits radioactivity. A gamma cam-era, used in nuclear medicine procedures, willpick up the radioactive signals as the substancegathers in an organ or tissue. They are sometimesreferred to as tracers.The chemistry of gallstones is complex and interest-\ning. Like too much sugar in solution, chemicals in bilewill form crystals as the gallbladder draws water out ofthe bile. The solubility of these chemicals is based on theconcentration of three chemicals, not just one—bileacids, phospholipids, and cholesterol. If the chemicalsare out of balance, one or the other will not remain insolution. Certain people, in particular the Pima tribe ofNative Americans in Arizona, have a genetic predisposi-tion to forming gallstones. Scandinavians also have ahigher than average incidence of this disease. Dietary fatand cholesterol are also implicated in their formation.Overweight women in their middle years constitute thevast majority of patients with gallstones in every group.\nAs the bile crystals aggregate to form stones, they\nmove about, eventually occluding the outlet and prevent-ing the gallbladder from emptying. This creates symp-toms. It also results in irritation, inflammation, andsometimes infection of the gallbladder. The pattern isusually one of intermittent obstruction due to stonesmoving in and out of the way. All the while the gallblad-der is becoming more scarred. Sometimes infection fillsit with pus—a serious complication.\nOn occasion a stone will travel down the cystic duct\ninto the common bile duct and get stuck there. This willback bile up into the liver as well as the gallbladder. Ifthe stone sticks at the Ampulla of Vater, the pancreas willalso be plugged and will develop pancreatitis . These\nstones can cause a lot of trouble.\nBile is composed of several waste products of metabo-\nlism, all of which are supposed to remain in liquid form.The complex chemistry of the liver depends on many chem-ical processes, which depend in turn upon the chemicals inthe diet and the genes that direct those processes. There aregreater variations in the output of chemical waste productsthan there is allowance for their cohabitation in the bile.Incompatible mixes result in the formation of solids.\nGallstones will cause the sudden onset of pain in the\nupper abdomen. Pain will last for 30 minutes to severalhours. Pain may move to the right shoulder blade. Nau-sea with or without vomiting may accompany the pain.\nPrecautions\nIndividuals suffering from sickle cell anemia, children,\nand patients with large stones may seek other treatments.\nDescription\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy\nSurgery to remove the entire gallbladder with all its\nstones is usually the best treatment, provided the patient\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1385Gallstone removalis able to tolerate the procedure. Over the past decade, a\nnew technique of removing the gallbladder using alaparoscope has resulted in quicker recovery and muchsmaller surgical incisions than the six-inch gash underthe right ribs that used to be standard. Not everyone is acandidate for this approach.\nIf a stone is lodged in the bile ducts, additional\nsurgery must be done to remove it. After surgery, the sur-geon will ordinarily leave in a drain to collect bile untilthe system is healed. The drain can also be used to injectcontrast material and take x rays during or after surgery.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatoscopy\n(ERCP)\nA procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholan-\ngiopancreatoscopy (ERCP) allows the removal of somebile duct stones through the mouth, throat, esophagus,stomach, duodenum, and biliary system without the needfor surgical incisions. ERCP can also be used to injectcontrast agents into the biliary system, providingsuperbly detailed pictures.Cholelithotomy\nRare circumstances require different techniques.\nPatients too ill for a complete cholecystectomy (removal\nof the gallbladder), sometimes only the stones areremoved, a procedure called cholelithotomy. But thatdoes not cure the problem. The liver will go on makingfaulty bile, and stones will reform, unless the composi-tion of the bile is altered.\nUrsodeoxycholic acid\nFor patients who cannot receive the laparoscopic\nprocedure, there is also a nonsurgical treatment in whichursodeoxycholic acid is used to dissolve the gallstones.Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy has also been\nsuccessfully used to break up gallstones. During the pro-cedure, high-amplitude sound waves target the stones,slowly breaking them up.\nPreparation\nThere are a number of imaging studies that identify\ngallbladder disease, but most gallstones will not show up\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1386Gallstone removal\nCystic duct\nLiverGallbladder\nPyloric sphincter\nCommon bile ductGallbladder\nGallstones\nPancreas Duodenum\nGallstone removal, also known as cholelithotomy, usually involves the surgical removal of the entire gallbladder, but in recent\nyears the procedure done by laparoscopy has resulted in smaller surgical incisions and faster recovery time.

Ultra-sound is very useful and can be enhanced by doing itthrough an endoscope in the stomach. CT ( computed\ntomography scans ) and MRI ( magnetic resonance\nimaging ) scanning are not used routinely but are helpful\nin detecting common duct stones and complications.\nAftercare\nWithout a gallbladder, stones rarely reform. Patients\nwho have continued symptoms after their gallbladder isremoved may need an ERCP to detect residual stones ordamage to the bile ducts caused by the stones before theywere removed. Once in a while the Ampulla of Vater istoo tight for bile to flow through and causes symptomsuntil it is opened up.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds.

    "title": "Gallstones",
    "content": "Gallstones\nDefinition\nA gallstone is a solid crystal deposit that forms in the\ngallbladder, which is a pear-shaped organ that stores bilesalts until they are needed to help digest fatty foods. Gall-stones can migrate to other parts of the digestive tract andcause severe pain with life-threatening complications.\nDescription\nGallstones vary in size and chemical structure. A\ngallstone may be as tiny as a grain of sand or as large as agolf ball. Eighty percent of gallstones are composed ofcholesterol. They are formed when the liver producesmore cholesterol than digestive juices can liquefy. Theremaining 20% of gallstones are composed of calciumand an orange-yellow waste product called bilirubin.Bilirubin gives urine its characteristic color and some-times causes jaundice .\nGallstones are the most common of all gallbladder\nproblems. They are responsible for 90% of gallbladder andbile duct disease, and are the fifth most common reasonfor hospitalization of adults in the United States. Gall-stones usually develop in adults between the ages of 20and 50; about 20% of patients with gallstones are over 40.The risk of developing gallstones increases with age—atleast 20% of people over 60 have a single large stone or asmany as several thousand smaller ones. The gender ratioof gallstone patients changes with age. Young women arebetween two and six times more likely to develop gall-stones than men in the same age group. In patients over50, the condition affects men and women with equal fre-quency. Native Americans develop gallstones more oftenthan any other segment of the population; Mexican-Amer-icans have the second-highest incidence of this disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1387GallstonesDefinitions\nGallstones can cause several different disorders.\nCholelithiasis is defined as the presence of gallstoneswithin the gallbladder itself. Choledocholithiasis is thepresence of gallstones within the common bile duct thatleads into the first portion of the small intestine (the duo-denum). The stones in the duct may have been formedinside it or carried there from the gallbladder. These gall-stones prevent bile from flowing into the duodenum. Tenpercent of patients with gallstones have choledocholithi-asis, which is sometimes called common-duct stones.Patients who don’t develop infection usually recovercompletely from this disorder.\nCholecystitis is a disorder marked by inflammation\nof the gallbladder. It is usually caused by the passage of astone from the gallbladder into the cystic duct, which is atube that connects the gallbladder to the common bileduct. In 5–10% of cases, however, cholecystitis developsin the absence of gallstones. This form of the disorder iscalled acalculous cholecystitis. Cholecystitis causespainful enlargement of the gallbladder and is responsiblefor 10–25% of all gallbladder surgery. Chronic cholecys-titis is most common in the elderly. The acute form ismost likely to occur in middle-aged adults.\nCholesterolosis or cholesterol polyps is character-\nized by deposits of cholesterol crystals in the lining ofthe gallbladder. This condition may be caused by highlevels of cholesterol or inadequate quantities of bile salts,and is usually treated by surgery.\nGallstone ileus , which results from a gallstone’s\nblocking the entrance to the large intestine, is mostcommon in elderly people. Surgery usually cures thiscondition.\nNarrowing (stricture) of the common bile duct\ndevelops in as many as 5% of patients whose gallblad-ders have been surgically removed. This condition ischaracterized by inability to digest fatty foods and byabdominal pain, which sometimes occurs in spasms.Patients with stricture of the common bile duct are likelyto recover after appropriate surgical treatment.\nCauses and symptoms\nGallstones are caused by an alteration in the chemi-\ncal composition of bile. Bile is a digestive fluid that helpsthe body absorb fat. Gallstones tend to run in families. Inaddition, high levels of estrogen, insulin, or cholesterolcan increase a person’s risk of developing them.\nPregnancy or the use of birth control pills can slow\ndown gallbladder activity and increase the risk of gall-stones. So can diabetes, pancreatitis , and celiac disease .\nOther factors influencing gallstone formation are:• infection\n• obesity• intestinal disorders\n• coronary artery disease or other recent illness\n• multiple pregnancies• a high-fat, low-fiber diet• smoking\n• heavy drinking\n• rapid weight loss\nGallbladder attacks usually follow a meal of rich,\nhigh-fat foods. The attacks often occur in the middle ofthe night, sometimes waking the patient with intensepain that ends in a visit to the emergency room. The painof a gallbladder attack begins in the abdomen and mayradiate to the chest, back, or the area between the shoul-ders. Other symptoms of gallstones include:\n• inability to digest fatty foods\n• low-grade fever\n• chills and sweating• nausea and vomiting• indigestion\n•g a s\n• belching.• clay-colored bowel movements\nDiagnosis\nGallstones may be diagnosed by a family doctor, a\nspecialist in digestive problems (a gastroenterologist), ora specialist in internal medicine. The doctor will firstexamine the patient’s skin for signs of jaundice and feel(palpate) the abdomen for soreness or swelling. After thebasic physical examination , the doctor will order blood\ncounts or blood chemistry tests to detect evidence of bileduct obstruction and to rule out other illnesses that causefever and pain, including stomach ulcers, appendicitis ,\nand heart attacks.\nMore sophisticated procedures used to diagnose\ngallstones include:\n• Ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound has an accuracy rate of\n96%.\n• Cholecystography (cholecystogram, gallbladder series,\ngallbladder x ray). This type of study shows how thegallbladder contracts after the patient has eaten a high-fat meal.\n• Fluoroscopy. This imaging technique allows the doctor\nto distinguish between jaundice caused by pancreaticcancer and jaundice caused by gallbladder or bile duct\ndisorders.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1388Gallstones• Endoscopy (ERCP). ERCP uses a special dye to outline\nthe pancreatic and common bile ducts and locate theposition of the gallstones.\n• Radioisotopic scan. This technique reveals blockage of\nthe cystic duct.\nTreatment\nWatchful waiting\nOne-third of all patients with gallstones never expe-\nrience a second attack. For this reason many doctorsadvise watchful waiting after the first episode. Reducingthe amount of fat in the diet or following a sensible planof gradual weight loss may be the only treatmentsrequired for occasional mild attacks. A patient diagnosedwith gallstones may be able to manage more troublesomeepisodes by:\n• applying heat to the affected area• resting and taking occasional sips of water\n• using non-prescription forms of acetaminophen (Tyle-\nnol or Anacin-3)\nA doctor should be notified if pain intensifies or\nlasts for more than three hours; if the patient’s fever risesabove 101°F (38.3°C); or if the skin or whites of the eyesturn yellow.\nSurgery\nSurgical removal of the gallbladder ( cholecystecto-\nmy) is the most common conventional treatment for\nrecurrent attacks. Laparoscopic surgery, the techniquemost widely used, is a safe, effective procedure thatinvolves less pain and a shorter recovery period than tra-ditional open surgery. In this technique, the doctor makesa small cut (incision) in the patient’s abdomen andremoves the gallbladder through a long tube called alaparoscope.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1389Gallstones\nGallbladderCommon\nbile ductStones\nGallstones form in the gallbladder but can migrate to other parts of the body via the bile duct. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)Nonsurgical approaches\nLITHOTRIPSY. Shock wave therapy ( lithotripsy )\nuses high-frequency sound waves to break up the gall-stones. The patient can then take bile salts to dissolve thefragments. Bile salt tablets are sometimes prescribedwithout lithotripsy to dissolve stones composed of cho-lesterol by raising the level of bile acids in the gallblad-der. This approach requires long-term treatment, since itmay take months or years for this method to dissolve asizeable stone.\nCONTACT DISSOLUTION. Contact dissolution can\ndestroy gallstones in a matter of hours. This minimallyinvasive procedure involves using a tube (catheter)inserted into the abdomen to inject medication directlyinto the gallbladder.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative therapies, like non-surgical treatments,\nmay provide temporary relief of gallstone symptoms.Alternative approaches to the symptoms of gallbladderdisorders include homeopathy , Chinese traditional\nherbal medicine, and acupuncture . Dietary changes may\nalso help relieve the symptoms of gallstones. Since gall-stones seem to develop more often in people who areobese, eating a balanced diet, exercising, and losingweight may help keep gallstones from forming.\nPrognosis\nForty percent of all patients with gallstones have\n“silent gallstones” that produce no symptoms. SilentKEY TERMS\nAcalculous cholecystitis —Inflammation of the gall-\nbladder that occurs without the presence of gall-stones.\nBilirubin —A reddish-yellow waste product pro-\nduced by the liver that colors urine and is involvedin the formation of some gallstones.\nCeliac disease —Inability to digest wheat protein\n(gluten), which causes weight loss, lack of energy,and pale, foul-smelling stools.\nCholecystectomy —Surgical removal of the gall-\nbladder.\nCholecystitis —Inflammation of the gallbladder.\nCholedocholithiasis —The presence of gallstones\nwithin the common bile duct.Cholelithiasis —The presence of gallstones within\nthe gallbladder.\nCholesterolosis —Cholesterol crystals or deposits in\nthe lining of the gallbladder.\nCommon bile duct —The passage through which\nbile travels from the cystic duct to the small intes-tine.\nGallstone ileus —Obstruction of the large intestine\ncaused by a gallstone that has blocked the intestinalopening.\nLithotripsy —A nonsurgical technique for removing\ngallstones by breaking them apart with high-fre-quency sound waves.\nstones, discovered only when their presence is indicated\nby tests performed to diagnose other symptoms, do notrequire treatment.\nGallstone problems that require treatment can be\nsurgically corrected.

The resulting infection can be fatal.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent gallstones is to minimize\nrisk factors. In addition, a 1998 study suggests that vigor-ous exercise may lower a man’s risk of developing gall-\nstones by as much as 28%.

    "title": "Gangrene",
    "content": "Gangrene\nDefinition\nGangrene is the term used to describe the decay or\ndeath of an organ or tissue caused by a lack of blood sup-\nply. It is a complication resulting from infectious or inflam-matory processes, injury, or degenerative changes associat-ed with chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus .\nDescription\nGangrene may be caused by a variety of chronic dis-\neases and post-traumatic, post-surgical, and spontaneouscauses. There are three major types of gangrene: dry,moist, and gas (a type of moist gangrene).\nDry gangrene is a condition that results when one or\nmore arteries become obstructed. In this type of gan-grene, the tissue slowly dies, due to receiving little or noblood supply, but does not become infected. The affectedarea becomes cold and black, begins to dry out and with-er, and eventually drops off over a period of weeks ormonths. Dry gangrene is most common in persons withadvanced blockages of the arteries (arteriosclerosis)resulting from diabetes.\nMoist gangrene may occur in the toes, feet, or legs\nafter a crushing injury or as a result of some other factorthat causes blood flow to the area to suddenly stop. Whenblood flow ceases, bacteria begin to invade the muscleand thrive, multiplying quickly without interference fromthe body’s immune system.\nGas gangrene, also called myonecrosis, is a type of\nmoist gangrene that is commonly caused by bacterialinfection with Clostridium welchii, Cl. perfringes, Cl.\nsepticum, Cl. novyi, Cl. histolyticum, Cl. sporogenes ,o r\nother species that are capable of thriving under condi-tions where there is little oxygen (anaerobic). Once pre-sent in tissue, these bacteria produce gasses and poiso-nous toxins as they grow. Normally inhabiting the gas-trointestinal, respiratory, and female genital tract, theyoften infect thigh amputationwounds , especially in\nthose individuals who have lost control of their bowelfunctions (incontinence). Gangrene, incontinence, anddebility often are combined in patients with diabetes, andit is in the amputation stump of diabetic patients that gasgangrene is often found to occur.\nOther causative organisms for moist gangrene\ninclude various bacterial strains, including Streptococcus\nand Staphylococcus . A serious, but rare form of infection\nwith Group A Streptococcus can impede blood flow and,\nif untreated, can progress to synergistic gangrene, morecommonly called necrotizing fasciitis, or infection of theskin and tissues directly beneath the skin.\nChronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, arte-\nriosclerosis, or diseases affecting the blood vessels, suchas Buerger’s disease or Raynaud’s disease , can cause\ngangrene. Post-traumatic causes of gangrene includecompound fractures ,burns , and injections given under\nthe skin or in a muscle. Gangrene may occur followingsurgery, particularly in individuals with diabetes melli-tus or other long-term (chronic) disease. In addition, gasgangrene can be also be a complication of dry gangreneor occur spontaneously in association with an underly-ing cancer .\nIn the United States, approximately 50% of moist\ngangrene cases are the result of a severe traumatic injury,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1393Gangreneand 40% occur following surgery. Car and industrial\naccidents, crush injuries, and gunshot wounds are themost common traumatic causes. Because of prompt sur-gical management of wounds with the removal of deadtissue, the incidence of gangrene from trauma has signifi-cantly diminished. Surgeries involving the bile ducts orintestine are the most frequent procedures causing gan-grene. Approximately two-thirds of cases affect theextremities, and the remaining one-third involve theabdominal wall.\nSymptoms\nAreas of either dry or moist gangrene are initially\ncharacterized by a red line on the skin that marks the bor-der of the affected tissues. As tissues begin to die, drygangrene may cause some pain in the early stages or\nmay go unnoticed, especially in the elderly or in thoseindividuals with diminished sensation to the affectedarea. Initially, the area becomes cold, numb, and palebefore later changing in color to brown, then black. Thisdead tissue will gradually separate from the healthy tis-sue and fall off.\nMoist gangrene and gas gangrene are distinctly dif-\nferent. Gas gangrene does not involve the skin as much,but usually only the muscle. In moist or gas gangrene,there is a sensation of heaviness in the affected regionthat is followed by severe pain. The pain is caused byswelling resulting from fluid or gas accumulation in thetissues. This pain peaks, on average, between one to fourdays following the injury, with a range of eight hours toseveral weeks. The swollen skin may initially be blis-tered, red, and warm to the touch before progressing to abronze, brown, or black color. In approximately 80% ofcases, the affected and surrounding tissues may producecrackling sounds (crepitus), as a result of gas bubblesaccumulating under the skin. The gas may be felt beneaththe skin (palpable). In wet gangrene, the pus is foul-\nsmelling, while in gas gangrene, there is no true pus, justan almost “sweet” smelling watery discharge.\nFever , rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, altered men-\ntal state, loss of appetite, diarrhea , vomiting, and vascu-\nlar collapse may also occur if the bacterial toxins areallowed to spread in the bloodstream. Gas gangrene canbe a life-threatening condition and should receive promptmedical attention\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis of gangrene will be based on a combi-\nnation of the patient history, a physical examination ,\nand the results of blood and other laboratory tests. Aphysician will look for a history of recent trauma,surgery, cancer, or chronic disease. Blood tests will beused to determine whether infection is present and deter-mine the extent to which an infection has spread.\nA sample of drainage from a wound, or obtained\nthrough surgical exploration, may be cultured with oxygen(aerobic) and without oxygen (anaerobic) to identify themicroorganism causing the infection and to aid in deter-mining which antibiotic will be most effective. The sampleobtained from a person with gangrene will contain few, ifany, white blood cells and, when stained (with Gram stain)and examined under the microscope, will show the pres-ence of purple (Gram positive), rod-shaped bacteria.\nX ray studies and more sophisticated imaging tech-\nniques, such as computed tomography scans (CT) or\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be helpful in\nmaking a diagnosis since gas accumulation and muscledeath (myonecrosis) may be visible. These techniques,however, are not sufficient alone to provide an accuratediagnosis of gangrene.\nPrecise diagnosis of gas gangrene often requires sur-\ngical exploration of the wound. During such a procedure,the exposed muscle may appear pale, beefy-red, or in themost advanced stages, black. If infected, the muscle willfail to contract with stimulation, and the cut surface willnot bleed.\nTreatment\nGas gangrene is a medical emergency because of the\nthreat of the infection rapidly spreading via the blood-stream and infecting vital organs. It requires immediatesurgery and administration of antibiotics .\nAreas of dry gangrene that remain free from infection\n(aseptic) in the extremities are most often left to witherand fall off. Treatments applied to the wound externally(topically) are generally not effective without adequate\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1394Gangrene\nA close-up of gangrene in the toes of a diabetic patient.\n(Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)blood supply to support wound healing. Assessment by a\nvascular surgeon, along with x rays to determine bloodsupply and circulation to the affected area, can help deter-mine whether surgical intervention would be beneficial.\nOnce the causative organism has been identified,\nmoist gangrene requires the prompt initiation of intra-venous, intramuscular, and/or topical broad-spectrumantibiotic therapy. In addition, the infected tissue must beremoved surgically ( debridement ), and amputation of\nthe affected extremity may be necessary. Pain medica-tions ( analgesics ) are prescribed to control discomfort.\nIntravenous fluids and, occasionally, blood transfusionsare indicated to counteract shock and replenish red blood\ncells and electrolytes. Adequate hydration and nutrition\nare vital to wound healing.\nAlthough still controversial, some cases of gangrene\nare treated by administering oxygen under pressuregreater than that of the atmosphere (hyperbaric) to thepatient in a specially designed chamber. The theorybehind using hyperbaric oxygen is that more oxygen willbecome dissolved in the patient’s bloodstream, andtherefore, more oxygen will be delivered to the gan-grenous areas. By providing optimal oxygenation, thebody’s ability to fight off the bacterial infection arebelieved to be improved, and there is a direct toxic effecton the bacteria that thrive in an oxygen-free environment.Some studies have shown that the use of hyperbaric oxy-gen produces marked pain relief, reduces the number ofamputations required, and reduces the extent of surgicaldebridement required. Patients receiving hyperbaric oxy-gen treatments must be monitored closely for evidence ofoxygen toxicity. Symptoms of this toxicity include slowheart rate, profuse sweating, ringing in the ears, short-\nness of breath ,nausea and vomiting , twitching of the\nlips/cheeks/eyelids/nose, and convulsions.\nThe emotional needs of the patient must also be met.\nThe individual with gangrene should be offered moral sup-port, along with an opportunity to share questions and con-cerns about changes in body image. In addition, particular-ly in cases where amputation was required, physical, voca-tional, and rehabilitation therapy will also be required.\nPrognosis\nExcept in cases where the infection has been\nallowed to spread through the blood stream, prognosis isgenerally favorable. Anaerobic wound infection canprogress quickly from initial injury to gas gangrene with-in one to two days, and the spread of the infection in theblood stream is associated with a 20–25% mortality rate.If recognized and treated early, however, approximately80% of those with gas gangrene survive, and only15–20% require any form of amputation.

    "title": "Gas embolism",
    "content": "Gas embolism\nDefinition\nGas embolism , also called air embolism, is the pres-\nence of gas bubbles in the bloodstream that obstruct cir-culation.\nDescription\nGas embolism may occur with decompression from\nincreased pressure; it typically occurs in ascending diverswho have been breathing compressed air. If a diver doesnot fully exhale upon ascent, the air in the lungs expandsas the pressure decreases, overinflating the lungs andforcing bubbles of gas (emboli) into the bloodstream.When gas emboli reach the arteries to the brain, the bloodblockage causes unconsciousness. Gas embolism is sec-ond only to drowning as a cause of death among divers.\nGas embolism may also result from trauma or med-\nical procedures such as catheterization and open heartsurgery that allow air into the circulatory system.\nCauses and symptoms\nGas embolism occurs independent of diving depth; it\nmay occur in as little as 6 ft of water. It is frequentlycaused by a diver holding his breath during ascent. Itmay also result from an airway obstruction or other con-dition that prevents a diver from fully exhaling.\nThe primary sign of gas embolism is immediate loss\nof consciousness; it may or may not be accompanied byconvulsions.\nDiagnosis\nAny unconscious diver should be assumed to be the\nvictim of gas embolism, regardless of whether con-sciousness was lost during or promptly after ascent. Adoctor may also find pockets of air in the chest aroundthe lungs and sometimes a collapsed lung from overinfla-tion and rupture. Coughing up blood or a bloody frotharound the mouth are visible signs of lung injury.\nTreatment\nPrompt recompression treatment in a hyperbaric\n(high-pressure) chamber is necessary to deflate the gas bub-bles in the bloodstream, dissolve the gases into the blood,and restore adequate oxygenated blood flow to the brain andother organs. Recompression by returning the diver to deep-er water will not work, and should not be attempted. Thepatient should be kept lying down and given oxygen whilebeing transported for recompression treatment.\nBefore the diver receives recompression treatment,\nother lifesaving efforts may be necessary. If the diverisn’t breathing, artificial respiration (also called mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or rescue breathing) should beadministered. In the absence of a pulse, cardiopul-\nmonary resuscitation (CPR ) must be performed.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis is dependent upon the promptness of\nrecompression treatment and the extent of the damagecaused by oxygen deprivation.\nPrevention\nAll divers should receive adequate training in the use\nof compressed air and a complete evaluation of fitnessfor diving. People with a medical history of lung cysts or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1396Gas embolismspontaneous collapsed lung ( pneumothorax ), and those\nwith active asthma or other lung disease must not dive,\nfor they would be at extreme risk for gas embolism.Patients with conditions such as alcoholism and drug\nabuse are also discouraged from diving.

    "title": "Gastrectomy",
    "content": "Gastrectomy\nDefinition\nGastrectomy is the surgical removal of all or part of\nthe stomach.\nPurpose\nGastrectomy is performed for several reasons, most\ncommonly to remove a malignant tumor or to cure a per-forated or bleeding stomach ulcer.\nDescription\nGastrectomy for cancer\nRemoval of the tumor, often with removal of sur-\nrounding lymph nodes, is the only curative treatment forvarious forms of gastric (stomach) cancer . For many\npatients, this entails removing not just the tumor but partof the stomach as well. The extent to which lymph nodesshould also be removed is a subject of some debate, butsome studies show additional survival benefit associatedwith removal of a greater number of lymph nodes.\nGastrectomy, either total or subtotal (also called par-\ntial), is the treatment of choice for gastric adenocarcino-mas, primary gastric lymphomas (originating in thestomach), and the rare leiomyosarcomas (also called gas-tric sarcomas ). Adenocarcinomas are by far the most\ncommon form of stomach cancer and are less curable\nthan the relatively uncommon lymphomas, for whichgastrectomy offers good odds for survival.\nAfter gastrectomy, the surgeon may “reconstruct”\nthe altered portions of the digestive tract so that it contin-ues to function. Several different surgical techniques areused, but, generally speaking, the surgeon attaches anyremaining portion of the stomach to the small intestine.\nGastrectomy for gastric cancer is almost always\ndone by the traditional “open” surgery technique, whichrequires a wide incision to open the abdomen. However,some surgeons use a laparoscopic technique that requiresonly a small incision. The laparoscope is connected to a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1397Gastrectomytiny video camera that projects a picture of the abdomi-\nnal contents onto a monitor for the surgeon’s viewing.The stomach is operated on through this incision.\nThe potential benefits of laparoscopic surgery\ninclude less postoperative pain , decreased hospitaliza-\ntion, and earlier return to normal activities. The use oflaparoscopic gastrectomy is limited, however. Onlypatients with early stage gastric cancers or those whosesurgery is only intended for palliation—pain and symp-tomatic relief rather than cure—should be considered forthis minimally invasive technique. It can only be per-formed by surgeons experienced in this type of surgery.\nGastrectomy for ulcers\nGastrectomy is also occasionally used in the treat-\nment of severe peptic ulcer disease or its complications.While the vast majority of peptic ulcers (gastric ulcers inthe stomach or duodenal ulcers in the duodenum) aremanaged with medication, partial gastrectomy is some-times required for peptic ulcer patients who have compli-cations. These include patients who do not respond satis-factorily to medical therapy, those who develop a bleed-ing or perforated ulcer, and those who develop pyloricobstruction, a blockage to the exit from the stomach.\nThe surgical procedure for severe ulcer disease is\nalso called an antrectomy, a limited form of gastrectomyin which the antrum, a portion of the stomach, isremoved. For duodenal ulcers, antrectomy may be com-bined with other surgical procedures that are aimed atreducing the secretion of gastric acid, which is associatedwith ulcer formation. This additional surgery is common-ly a vagotomy , surgery on the vagus nerve that disables\nthe acid-producing portion of the stomach.\nPreparation\nBefore undergoing gastrectomy, patients may need a\nvariety of tests, such as x rays, computed tomography\nscans (CT scans), ultrasonography, or endoscopic biopsies\n(microscopic examination of tissue), to assure the diagno-sis and localize the tumor or ulcer. Laparoscopy may be\ndone to diagnose a malignancy or to determine the extentof a tumor that is already diagnosed. When a tumor isstrongly suspected, laparoscopy is often performed imme-diately before the surgery to remove the tumor; this avoidsthe need to anesthetize the patient twice and sometimesavoids the need for surgery altogether if the tumor foundon laparoscopy is deemed inoperable.\nAftercare\nIt is important to follow any instructions that have\nbeen given for postoperative care. Major surgery usuallyrequires a recuperation time of several weeks.\nRisks\nSurgery for peptic ulcer is effective, but it may result\nin a variety of postoperative complications. After gas-trectomy, as many as 30% of patients have significantsymptoms. An operation called highly selective vagoto-my is now preferred for ulcer management, and is saferthan gastrectomy.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1398Gastrectomy\nTotal gastrectomy Partial gastrectomy Partial gastrectomy\nGastrectomy, the surgical removal of all or part of the stomach, is performed primarily to remove a malignant tumor or to\ncure a bleeding stomach ulcer. Following the gastrectomy, the surgeon may reconstruct the altered portions of the digestivetract so that it continues to function. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)After a gastrectomy, several abnormalities may\ndevelop that produce symptoms related to food intake.This happens largely because the stomach, which servesas a food reservoir, has been reduced in its capacity bythe surgery. Other surgical procedures that often accom-pany gastrectomy for ulcer disease can also contribute tolater symptoms: vagotomy, which lessens acid produc-tion and slows stomach emptying, and pyloroplasty ,\nwhich enlarges the opening between the stomach andsmall intestine to facilitate emptying of the stomach.\nSome patients experience light-headedness, heart\npalpitations or racing heart, sweating, and nausea and\nvomiting after a meal. These may be symptoms of\n“dumping syndrome,” as food is rapidly “dumped” intothe small intestine from the stomach. This is treated byadjusting the diet and pattern of eating, for example, eat-ing smaller, more frequent meals, and limiting liquids.\nPatients who have abdominal bloating and pain after\neating, frequently followed by nausea and vomiting, mayhave what is called the afferent loop syndrome. This istreated by surgical correction. Patients who have earlysatiety (feeling of fullness after eating), abdominal dis-comfort, and vomiting may have bile reflux gastritis\n(also called bilious vomiting), which is also surgicallycorrectable. Many patients also experience weight loss.\nReactive hypoglycemia is a condition that results\nwhen blood sugar becomes too high after a meal, stimu-lating the release of insulin, about two hours after eating.A high-protein diet and smaller meals are advised.\nUlcers recur in a small percentage of patients after\nsurgery for peptic ulcer, usually in the first few years.Further surgery is usually necessary.\nVitamin and mineral supplementation is necessary\nafter gastrectomy to correct certain deficiencies, espe-cially vitamin B\n12, iron, and folate. Vitamin D and calci-\num are also needed to prevent and treat the bone prob-lems that often occur. These include softening and bend-ing of the bones, which can produce pain, and osteo-\nporosis , a loss of bone mass. According to one study, the\nrisk for spinal fractures may be as high as 50% after\ngastrectomy.\nDepending on the extent of surgery, the risk for post-\noperative death after gastrectomy for gastric cancer has\nbeen reported as 1–3% and the risk of non-fatal compli-cations as 9–18%.\nNormal results\nOverall survival after gastrectomy for gastric cancer\nvaries greatly by the stage of disease at the time ofsurgery. For early gastric cancer, the five-year survivalrate is up to 80–90%; for late-stage disease, the progno-KEY TERMS\nAntrectomy —A surgical procedure for ulcer dis-\nease in which the antrum, a portion of the stom-ach, is removed.\nLaparoscopy —The examination of the inside of\nthe abdomen through a lighted tube, sometimesaccompanied by surgery.\nsis is bad. For gastric adenocarcinomas that are amenable\nto gastrectomy, the five-year survival rate is 10–30%,depending on the location of the tumor. The prognosisfor patients with gastric lymphoma is better, with five-year survival rates reported at 40–60%.\nMost studies have shown that patients can have an\nacceptable quality of life after gastrectomy for a poten-tially curable gastric cancer. Many patients will maintaina healthy appetite and eat a normal diet. Others may loseweight and not enjoy meals as much. Some studies showthat patients who have total gastrectomies have more dis-ease-related or treatment-related symptoms after surgeryand poorer physical function than patients who havesubtotal gastrectomies. There does not appear to be muchdifference, however, in emotional status or social activitylevel between patients who have undergone total versussubtotal gastrectomies.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Disorders of the Stomach and Duodenum.” In The Merck Man-\nual.Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck & Co., Inc., 1992.\n“Stomach and Duodenum: Complications of Surgery for Peptic\nUlcer Disease.” In Steisenger & Fordtran’s Gastrointesti-\nnal and Liver Disease , ed.

    "title": "Gastric acid determination",
    "content": "Gastric acid determination\nDefinition\nGastric acid determination, also known as stomach\nacid determination, gastric analysis, or basal gastric secre-tion, is a procedure to evaluate gastric (stomach) function.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1399Gastric acid determinationThe test specifically determines the presence of gastric\nacid, as well as the amount of gastric acid secreted. It isoften done in conjunction with the gastric acid stimulationtest, a procedure that measures gastric acid output afterinjection of a drug to stimulate gastric acid secretion.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the gastric acid determination is to\nevaluate gastric function by measuring the amount ofacid as suctioned directly from the stomach. The com-plete gastric acid determination includes the basal gastricsecretion test, which measures acid secretion while thepatient is in a fasting state (nothing to eat or drink), fol-\nlowed by the gastric acid stimulation test, which mea-sures the secretion of gastric acid for one hour afterinjection of pentagastrin or a similar drug that stimulatesgastric acid output. The Gastric acid stimulation test isdone when the basal secretion test suggests abnormalitiesin gastric secretion. It is normally performed immediate-ly afterward.\nThe basal gastric secretion test is indicated for\npatients with obscure gastric pain , loss of appetite, and\nweight loss. It is also utilized for suspected peptic (relatedto the stomach) ulcer, severe stomach inflammation ( gas-\ntritis ), and Zollinger-Ellison (Z-E) syndrome (a condition\nin which a pancreatic tumor, called a gastrinoma , stimu-\nlates the stomach to secrete excessive amounts of acid,resulting in peptic ulcers). Because external factors likethe sight or odor of food, as well as psychological stress ,\ncan stimulate gastric secretion, accurate testing requiresthat the patient be relaxed and isolated from all sources ofsensory stimulation. Abnormal basal secretion can sug-gest various gastric and duodenal disorders, so furtherevaluation requires the gastric acid stimulation test.\nThe gastric acid stimulation test is indicated when\nabnormalities are found during the basal secretion test.These abnormalities can be caused by a number of dis-orders, including duodenal ulcer, pernicious anemia ,\nand gastric cancer . The test will detect abnormalities,\nbut x rays and other studies are necessary for a defini-tive diagnosis.\nPrecautions\nBecause both the basal gastric secretion test and the\ngastric acid stimulation test require insertion of a gastrictube (intubation) through the mouth or nasal passage, nei-ther test is recommended for patients with esophageal prob-lems, aortic aneurysm , severe gastric hemorrhage, or con-\ngestive heart failure . The gastric acid stimulation test is\nalso not recommended in patients who are sensitive to pen-tagastrin (the drug used to stimulate gastric acid output).Description\nThis test, whether performed for basal gastric acid\nsecretion, gastric acid stimulation, or both, requires thepassage of a lubricated rubber tube, either by mouth orthrough the nasal passage, while the patient is in a sittingor reclining position on the left side. The tube is situatedin the stomach, with proper positioning confirmed byfluoroscopy or x ray.\nBasal gastric acid secretion\nAfter a wait of approximately 10–15 minutes for the\npatient to adjust to the presence of the tube, and with thepatient in a sitting position, specimens are obtained every15 minutes for a period of 90 minutes. The first two speci-mens are discarded to eliminate gastric contents thatmight be affected by the stress of the intubation process.The patient is allowed no liquids during the test, and sali-va must be ejected to avoid diluting the stomach contents.\nThe four specimens collected during the test consti-\ntute the basal acid output . If analysis suggests abnormal-\nly low gastric secretion, the gastric acid stimulation testis performed immediately afterward.\nGastric acid stimulation test\nAfter the basal samples have been collected, the tube\nremains in place for the gastric acid stimulation test. Pen-tagastrin, or a similar drug that stimulates gastric acidoutput, is injected under the skin (subcutaneously). After15 minutes, a specimen is collected every 15 minutes forone hour. These specimens are called the poststimulation\nspecimens . As is the case with the basal gastric secretion\ntest, the patient can have no liquids during this test, andmust eject saliva to avoid diluting the stomach contents.\nPreparation\nThe patient should be fasting (nothing to eat or drink\nafter the evening meal) on the day prior to the test, butmay have water up to one hour before the test. Antacids ,\nanticholinergics, cholinergics, alcohol, H\n2-receptor\nantagonists (Tagamet, Pepcid, Axid, Zantac), reserpine,adrenergic blockers, and adrenocorticosteroids should bewithheld for one to three days before the test, as thephysician requests. If pentagastrin is to be administeredfor the gastric acid secretion test, medical supervisionshould be maintained, as possible side effects may occur.\nAftercare\nComplications such as nausea, vomiting, and\nabdominal distention or pain are possible followingremoval of the gastric tube. If the patient has a sore\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1400Gastric acid determinationthroat , soothing lozenges may be given. The patient may\nalso resume the usual diet and any medications that werewithheld for the test(s).\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk that the gastric tube may be\ninserted improperly, entering the windpipe (trachea) andnot the esophagus. If this happens, the patient may have adifficult time breathing or may experience a coughingspell until the tube is removed and reinserted properly.Also, because the tube can be difficult to swallow, if apatient has an overactive gag reflex, there may be a tran-sient rise in blood pressure due to anxiety .\nNormal results\nReference values for the basal gastric secretion test\nvary by laboratory, but are usually within the followingranges:\n• men: 1–5 mEq/h\n• women: 0.2–3.8 mEq/h\nReference values for the gastric acid stimulation test\nvary by laboratory, but are usually within the followingranges:\n• men: 18–28 mEq/h• women: 11–21 mEq/hKEY TERMS\nAchlorhydria —An abnormal condition in which\nhydrochloric acid is absent from the secretions ofthe gastric glands in the stomach.\nPernicious anemia —One of the main types of ane-\nmia, caused by inadequate absorption of vitaminB\n12. Symptoms include tingling in the hands, legs,\nand feet, spastic movements, weight loss, confusion,depression, and decreased intellectual function.\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome —A rare condition\ncharacterized by severe and recurrent pepticulcers in the stomach, duodenum, and uppersmall intestine, caused by a tumor, or tumors, usu-ally found in the pancreas. The tumor secretes thehormone gastrin, which stimulates the stomachand duodenum to produce large quantities ofacid, leading to ulceration. Most often cancerous,the tumor must be removed surgically; otherwisetotal surgical removal of the stomach is necessary.Abnormal results\nAbnormal findings in the basal gastric secretion test\nare considered nonspecific and must be evaluated in con-junction with the results of a gastric acid stimulation test.Elevated secretion may suggest different types of ulcers;when markedly elevated, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome issuspected. Depressed secretion can indicate gastric can-cer, while complete absence of secretion (achlorhydria)may suggest pernicious anemia.\nElevated gastric secretion levels in the gastric acid\nstimulation test may be indicative of duodenal ulcer;\nhigh levels of secretion again suggest Zollinger-Ellisonsyndrome.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

    "content": "Gastric emptying scan\nDefinition\nA gastric emptying scan (GES) is an x-ray exam\nusing special radioactive material that allows physicians toidentify abnormalities related to emptying of the stomach.Diseases that involve changes in the way the stomach con-tracts (motility disorders) are best diagnosed by this test.\nPurpose\nThe study is used most frequently to evaluate\npatients who have symptoms suggestive of decreased,delayed, or rapid gastric emptying, and no visible abnor-mality to explain their symptoms.\nSymptoms pointing to a delay in gastric emptying\nare non-specific, and may be due to a number of causes,such as ulcers, diabetes, tumors, and others. These symp-toms include nausea, upper abdominal bloating, and attimes vomiting. Another significant symptom is called“early satiety,” which means feeling full after eating onlya small amount of food. In some patients, weight loss is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1401Gastric emptying scanalso present. In addition to symptoms, the finding of a\nlarge amount of material in the stomach after anovernight fast suggests abnormal emptying, but does notdistinguish between an actual blockage or an irregularityin gastric contractions. It is therefore essential to find outwhat is causing material to remain in the stomach.\nSince many diseases can produce the above symptoms,\nstructural lesions (such as tumors or regions of narrowing orscar tissue) need to be ruled out first. This is usually done byupper gastrointestinal series test or by endoscopy (examina-tion of the inside of an organ, in this instance the stomach,with an instrument that has a light at the end of it and anoptical system for examination of the organ). Once it is clearthat a mechanical or physical lesion is not the cause ofsymptoms, attempts to document an abnormality in the ner-vous or muscular function of the stomach is then begun.GES is usually the first step in that evaluation.\nPrecautions\nThe exam should not be performed on pregnant\nwomen, but is otherwise quite safe. Since eggs are usual-ly used to hold the radioactive material, patients shouldnotify their physician if they are allergic to eggs. Howev-er, other materials can be used in place of an egg.\nDescription\nGastric emptying scans have undergone several\nchanges since the initial studies in the late 1970s. Duringthe study, patients are asked to ingest an egg sandwichcontaining a radioactive substance (for example, tech-netium) that can be followed by a special camera. Theemptying of the material from the stomach is then fol-lowed and displayed both in the form of an image, aswell as the percentage emptied over several hours (gener-ally two and four hours). Studies are in progress usingsubstances that are not radioactive, but this procedure isnot available to the patient as of yet.KEY TERMS\nEndoscopy —The examination of the inside of an\norgan with an instrument that has a light at theend of it and an optical system for examination ofthe organ.\nMotility —Motility is spontaneous movement. One\nexample is the automatic stomach contractionsthat move the food content along from the stomachinto the intestines. A motility disease is one thatinvolves changes in the way the stomach contracts.Preparation\nThe only preparation involved is for the patient to\nfast overnight before the test.\nRisks\nThe radiation exposure during the study is quite\nsmall and safe, unless the patient is pregnant.\nNormal results\nThere are several different measurements considered\nnormal, depending on the radioactive material and solidmeal used. The value is expressed as a percentage ofemptying over a period of time. For a technetium-filledegg sandwich, normal emptying is 78 minutes for halfthe material to leave the stomach, with a variation of 11minutes either way.\nAbnormal results\nGES scan studies that show emptying of the stomach\nin a longer than accepted period is abnormal. Severity oftest results and symptoms do not always match; there-fore, the physician must carefully interpret these find-ings. Diabetic injury to the nerves that supply the stom-ach (called diabetic gastroparesis) is one of the mostcommon causes of abnormal gastric motility. However,up to 30% of patients have no obvious cause to explainthe abnormal results and symptoms. These cases arecalled idiopathic (of unknown cause). GES is often usedto follow the effect of medications used for treatment ofmotility disorders.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCamilleri, Michael, and Charlene M.

    "title": "Gastrinoma",
    "content": "Gastrinoma\nDefinition\nGastrinomas are tumors associated with a rare gas-\ntroenterological disorder known as Zollinger-Ellisonsyndrome (ZES). They occur primarily in the pancreasand duodenum (beginning of the small intestine) andsecrete large quantities of the hormone gastrin, triggeringgastric acid production that produces ulcers. They maybe malignant (cancerous) or benign.\nDescription\nGastrinomas are an integral part of the Zollinger-\nEllison syndrome (ZES). In fact, ZES is also known asgastrinoma. This syndrome consists of ulcer disease inthe upper gastrointestinal tract, marked increases in thesecretion of gastric acid in the stomach, and tumors ofthe islet cells in the pancreas. The tumors produce largeamounts of gastrin that are responsible for the character-istics of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, namely severe ulcerdisease. Although usually located within the pancreas,they may occur in other organs.\nGastrinomas may occur randomly and sporadically,\nor they may be inherited as part of a genetic conditioncalled multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syn-drome. About half of persons with MEN-1 have gastrino-mas, which tend to be more numerous and smaller thantumors in sporadic cases.\nAbout half of ZES patients have multiple gastrino-\nmas, which can vary in size from 1–20 mm. Gastrinomasfound in the pancreas are usually much larger than duo-denal gastrinomas. About two thirds of gastrinomas aremalignant (cancerous). These usually grow slowly, butsome may invade surrounding sites rapidly and metasta-size (spread) widely. Sometimes, gastrinomas are foundonly in the lymph nodes, and it is uncertain whetherthese malignancies have originated in the lymph nodes orhave metastasized from a tumor not visible in the pan-creas or duodenum.\nThere is some evidence that the more malignant form\nof gastrinomas is more frequent in larger pancreatictumors, especially in females and in persons with a shorterdisease symptom duration and higher serum gastrin levels.Causes and symptoms\nMost persons with gastrinomas secrete profound\namounts of gastric acid, and almost all develop ulcers,mostly in the duodenum or stomach. Early in the courseof the disease, symptoms are typical of peptic ulcers,however once the disease is established, the ulcersbecome more persistent and symptomatic, and mayrespond poorly to standard anti-ulcer therapy. Abdominalpain is the predominant symptom of ulcer disease. About\n40% of patients have diarrhea as well. In some patients,\ndiarrhea is the primary symptom of gastrinoma.\nDiagnosis\nPersons with gastrinomas have many of the same\nsymptoms as persons with ulcers. Their levels of gastricacid, however, are usually far greater than those in com-mon ulcer disease. Gastrinomas are usually diagnosed bya blood test that measures the level of gastrin in theblood. Patients with gastrinomas often have gastrin levelsmore than 200 pg/mL, which is 4–10 times higher thannormal. Serum gastrin levels as high as 450,000 pg/mLhave occurred.\nWhen the serum gastrin test does not show these\nextremely high levels of gastrin, patients may be givencertain foods or injections in an attempt to provoke aresponse that will help diagnose the condition. Themost useful of these provocative tests is the secretininjection test (or secretin stimulation or provocativetest), which will almost always produce a positiveresponse in persons with gastrinomas but seldom inpersons without them.\nSurgically, gastrinomas are often difficult to locate,\neven with careful inspection. They may be missed in atleast 10–20% of patients with ZES. Gastrinomas aresometimes found only because they have metastasizedand produced symptoms related to the spread of malig-nancy. Such metastasis may be the most reliable indica-tion of whether the gastrinoma is malignant or benign.\nDiagnostic imaging techniques help locate the gas-\ntrinomas. The most sophisticated is an x-ray test calledradionuclide octreotide scanning (also known as somato-statin receptor scintigraphy or 111In pentetreotideSPECT). A study by the National Institutes of Health(NIH) found this test to be superior to other imagingmethods, such as computed tomography scan (CT) ormagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in pinpointing the\nlocation of tumors and guiding physicians in treatment.\nApproximately half of all gastrinomas do not show\nup on imaging studies. Therefore, exploratory surgery isoften recommended to try to locate and remove thetumors.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1403GastrinomaTreatment\nTherapy for gastrinomas should be individualized,\nsince patients tend to have varying degrees of disease andsymptoms. Treatment is aimed at eliminating the over-production of gastric acid and removing the gastrin-pro-ducing tumors.\nDrugs\nGastrinomas may not be easily treated by the standard\nanti-ulcer approaches. The medical treatment of choice iswith drugs called proton pump inhibitors, such as omepra-zole or lansoprazole, daily. These drugs are potentinhibitors of gastric acid. High doses of H-2 receptor antag-onists may also reduce gastric acid secretion, improvesymptoms, and induce ulcer healing. These drugs must becontinued indefinitely, since even a brief discontinuationwill cause ulcer recurrence. Antacids may provide some\nrelief, but it is usually not longlasting or healing.\nSurgery\nBecause of the likelihood that gastrinomas may be\nmalignant, in both sporadic tumors and those associatedwith the inherited MEN-1 syndrome, surgery to locateKEY TERMS\nGastrin —A hormone secreted in the stomach that\nis involved in the production of gastric acid.

It is now\nknown that complete surgical removal of gastrinomascan cure the overproduction of gastrin, even in patientswho have metastases to the lymph nodes. Surgery inpatients with MEN-1 and ZES, however, remains contro-versial since the benefit is less clear.\nFreedom from disease after surgery is judged by\nimproved symptoms, reduced gastric acid production,reduced need for drug therapy, normalization of serumgastrin levels, and normalization of results from thesecretin stimulation test and imaging studies.\nPrognosis\nMedical therapy often controls symptoms, and\nsurgery may or may not cure gastrinoma. About 50% ofZES patients in whom gastrinomas are not removed willdie from malignant spread of the tumor. In patients withgastrinomas as part of MEN-1 syndrome, the cure rate isextremely low.\nA NIH study of patients who had surgical removal\nof gastrinomas found that 42% were disease-free oneyear after surgery and 35% were disease-free at fiveyears. Disease recurrences can often be detected with aserum gastrin test or secretin stimulation test.\nWhen gastrinomas are malignant, they often grow\nslowly. The principal sites of metastasis are the regionallymph nodes and liver, but they may also spread to otherstructures. About one quarter of patients with gastrino-mas have liver metastases at the time of diagnosis. Thisappears to be more frequent with pancreatic gastrinomasthan duodenal gastrinomas.\nMetastases of malignant gastrinomas to the liver is\nvery serious. Survival five years after diagnosis is20–30%, however patients with gastrinomas found onlyin the lymph nodes have been known to live as long as25 years after diagnosis, without evidence of furthertumor spread. In fact, the life expectancy of patientswith gastrinomas that have spread to the lymph nodes isno different from that of patients with gastrinomas thatcannot even be found at surgery for about 90%, fiveyears after diagnosis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFriedman, Lawrence S., and Walter L.

    "title": "Gastritis",
    "content": "Gastritis\nDefinition\nGastritis commonly refers to inflammation of the\nlining of the stomach, but the term is often used to covera variety of symptoms resulting from stomach lininginflammation and symptoms of burning or discomfort.True gastritis comes in several forms and is diagnosedusing a combination of tests. In the 1990s, scientists dis-covered that the main cause of true gastritis is infectionfrom a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori ).\nDescription\nGastritis should not be confused with common\nsymptoms of upper abdominal discomfort. It has beenassociated with resulting ulcers, particularly pepticulcers. And in some cases, chronic gastritis can lead tomore serious complications.\nNonerosive H. pylori gastritis\nThe main cause of true gastritis is H. pylori infec-\ntion. H. pylori is indicated in an average of 90% of\npatients with chronic gastritis. This form of nonerosivegastritis is the result of infection with Helicobacter\npylori bacterium, a microorganism whose outer layer is\nresistant to the normal effects of stomach acid in break-ing down bacteria.\nThe resistance of H. pylori means that the bacterium\nmay rest in the stomach for long periods of times, evenyears, and eventually cause symptoms of gastritis orulcers when other factors are introduced, such as thepresence of specific genes or ingestion of nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Study of the role\nof H. pylori in development of gastritis and peptic ulcers\nhas disproved the former belief that stress lead to most\nstomach and duodenal ulcers and has resulted inimproved treatment and reduction of stomach ulcers. H.pylori is most likely transmitted between humans,\nalthough the specific routes of transmission were stillunder study in early 1998. Studies were also underway todetermine the role of H. pylori and resulting chronic gas-\ntritis in development of gastric cancer .\nErosive and hemorrhagic gastritis\nAfter H. pylori , the second most common cause of\nchronic gastritis is use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs. These commonly used pain killers, including\naspirin , fenoprofen, ibuprofen and naproxen, among\nothers, can lead to gastritis and peptic ulcers. Otherforms of erosive gastritis are those due to alcohol andcorrosive agents or due to trauma such as ingestion offoreign bodies.\nOther forms of gastritis\nClinicians differ on the classification of the less\ncommon and specific forms of gastritis, particularlysince there is so much overlap with H. pylori in develop-\nment of chronic gastritis and complications of gastritis.Other types of gastritis that may be diagnosed include:\n• Acute stress gastritis—the most serious form of gastri-\ntis which usually occurs in critically ill patients, such asthose in intensive care. Stress erosions may developsuddenly as a result of severe trauma or stress to thestomach lining.\n• Atrophic gastritis is the result of chronic gastritis which\nis leading to atrophy, or decrease in size and wastingaway, of the gastric lining. Gastric atrophy is the finalstage of chronic gastritis and may be a precursor to gas-tric cancer.\n• Superficial gastritis is a term often used to describe the\ninitial stages of chronic gastritis.\n• Uncommon specific forms of gastritis include granulo-\nmatous, eosiniphilic and lymphocytic gastritis.\nCauses and symptoms\nNonerosive H. pylori gastritis\nH. pylori gastritis is caused by infection from the H.\npylori bacterium. It is believed that most infection occurs\nin childhood. The route of its transmission was still understudy in 1998 and clinicians guessed that there may bemore than one route for the bacterium. Its prevalence anddistribution differs in nations around the world. The pres-ence of H. pylori has been detected in 86–99% of\npatients with chronic superficial gastritis. However,physicians are still learning about the link of H. pylori to\nchronic gastritis and peptic ulcers, since many patientswith H. pylori infection do not develop symptoms or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1405Gastritispeptic ulcers. H. pylori is also seen in 90–100% of\npatients with duodenal ulcers.\nSymptoms of H. pylori gastritis include abdominal\npain and reduced acid secretion in the stomach. However,the majority of patients with H. pylori infection suffer no\nsymptoms, even though the infection may lead to ulcersand resulting symptoms. Ulcer symptoms include dull,gnawing pain, often two to three hours after meals andpain in the middle of the night when the stomach is empty.\nErosive and hemorrhagic gastritis\nThe most common cause of this form of gastritis is\nuse of NSAIDS. Other causes may be alcoholism or\nstress from surgery or critical illness. The role ofNSAIDS in development of gastritis and peptic ulcersdepends on the dose level. Although even low doses ofaspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsmay cause some gastric upset, low doses generally willnot lead to gastritis. However, as many as 10–30% ofpatients on higher and more frequent doses of NSAIDS,such as those with chronic arthritis, may develop gastriculcers. In 1998, studies were underway to understand therole of H. pylori in gastritis and ulcers among patients\nusing NSAIDS.\nPatients with erosive gastritis may also show no\nsymptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may includeanorexia nervosa , gastric pain, nausea and vomiting .\nOther Forms of Gastritis\nLess common forms of gastritis may result from a\nnumber of generalized diseases or from complications ofchronic gastritis. Any number of mechanisms may causevarious less common forms of gastritis and they may dif-fer slightly in their symptoms and clinical signs. Howev-er, they all have in common inflammation of the gastricmucosa.\nDiagnosis\nNonerosive H. pylori gastritis\nH. pylori gastritis is easily diagnosed through the\nuse of the urea breath test. This test detects active pres-ence of H. pylori infection. Other serological tests, which\nmay be readily available in a physician’s office, may beused to detect H. pylori infection. Newly developed ver-\nsions offer rapid diagnosis. The choice of test willdepend on cost, availability and the physician’s experi-ence, since nearly all of the available tests have an accu-racy rate of 90% or better. Endoscopy, or the examinationof the stomach area using a hollow tube inserted throughthe mouth, may be ordered to confirm diagnosis. A biop-sy of the gastric lining may also be ordered.Erosive or hemorrhagic gastritis\nClinical history of the patient may be particularly\nimportant in the diagnosis of this type of gastritis, sinceits cause is most often the result of chronic use ofNSAIDS, alcoholism, or other substances.\nOther forms of gastritis\nGastritis that has developed to the stage of duodenal\nor gastric ulcers usually requires endoscopy for diagno-sis. It allows the physician to perform a biopsy for possi-ble malignancy and for H. pylori . Sometimes, an upper\ngastrointestinal x-ray study with barium is ordered.Some diseases such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, anulcer disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract, mayshow large mucosal folds in the stomach and duodenumon radiographs or in endoscopy. Other tests check forchanges in gastric function.\nTreatment\nH. pylori gastritis\nThe discovery of H. pylori’s role in development of\ngastritis and ulcers has led to improved treatment ofchronic gastritis. In particular, relapse rates for duodenaland gastric ulcers has been reduced with successful treat-ment of H. pylori infection. Since the infection can be\ntreated with antibiotics , the bacterium can be completely\neliminated up to 90% of the time.\nAlthough H. pylori can be successfully treated, the\ntreatment may be uncomfortable for patients and reliesheavily on patient compliance. In 1998, studies wereunderway to identify the best treatment method based onsimplicity, patient cooperation and results. No singleantibiotic had been found which would eliminate H.\npylori on its own, so a combination of antibiotics has\nbeen prescribed to treat the infection.\nDUAL THERAPY. Dual therapy involves the use of an\nantibiotic and a proton pump inhibitor. Proton pumpinhibitors help reduce stomach acid by halting the mech-anism that pumps acid into the stomach. This also helpspromote healing of ulcers or inflammation. Dual therapyhas not been proven to be as effective as triple therapy,but may be ordered for some patients who can morecomfortably handle the use of less drugs and will there-fore more likely follow the two-week course of therapy.\nTRIPLE THERAPY. As of early 1998, triple therapy was\nthe preferred treatment for patients with H. pylori gastri-\ntis. It is estimated that triple therapy successfully elimi-nates 80–95% of H. pylori cases. This treatment regimen\nusually involves a two-week course of three drugs. Anantibiotic such as amoxicillin or tetracycline, and another\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1406Gastritisantibiotic such as clarithomycin or metronidazole are\nused in combination with bismuth subsalicylate, a sub-stance found in the over-the-counter medication, Pepto-Bismol, which helps protect the lining of the stomachfrom acid. Physicians were experimenting with variouscombinations of drugs and time of treatment to balanceside effects with effectiveness. Side effects of triple thera-py are not serious, but may cause enough discomfort thatpatients are not inclined to follow the treatment.\nOTHER TREATMENT THERAPIES. Scientists have\nexperimented with quadruple therapy, which adds anantisecretory drug, or one which suppresses gastricsecretion, to the standard triple therapy. One studyshowed this therapy to be effective with only a week’scourse of treatment in more than 90% of patients. Shortcourse therapy was attempted with triple therapy involv-ing antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor and seemedeffective in eliminating H. pylori in one week for more\nthan 90% of patients. The goal is to develop the mosteffective therapy combination that can work in one weekof treatment or less.\nMEASURING H. PYLORI TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS.\nIn order to ensure that H. pylori has been eradicated,\nphysicians will test patients following treatment. Thebreath test is the preferred method to check for remainingsigns of H. pylori .\nTreatment of erosive gastritis\nSince few patients with this form of gastritis show\nsymptoms, treatment may depend on severity of symp-toms. When symptoms do occur, patients may be treatedwith therapy similar to that for H. pylori , especially since\nsome studies have demonstrated a link between H. pylori\nand NSAIDS in causing ulcers. Avoidance of NSAIDSwill most likely be prescribed.\nOther forms of gastritis\nSpecific treatment will depend on the cause and type\nof gastritis. These may include prednisone or antibiotics.Critically ill patients at high risk for bleeding may betreated with preventive drugs to reduce risk of acutestress gastritis. If stress gastritis does occur, the patient istreated with constant infusion of a drug to stop bleeding.Sometimes surgery is recommended, but is weighed withthe possibility of surgical complications or death . Once\ntorrential bleeding occurs in acute stress gastritis, mortal-ity is as high as greater than 60%.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative forms of treatment for gastritis and\nulcers should be used cautiously and in conjunction withKEY TERMS\nDuodenal —Refers to the duodenum, or the first\npart of the small intestine.\nGastric —Relating to the stomach.\nMucosa —The mucous membrane, or the thin\nlayer which lines body cavities and passages.\nUlcer —A break in the skin or mucous membrane.\nIt can fester and pus like a sore.\nconventional medical care, particularly now that scien-\ntists have confirmed the role of H. pylori in gastritis and\nulcers. Alternative treatments can help address gastritissymptoms with diet and nutritional supplements, herbalmedicine and ayurvedic medicine . It is believed that\nzinc, vitamin A and beta-carotene aid in the stomach lin-ing’s ability to repair and regenerate itself. Herbs thoughtto stimulate the immune system and reduce inflammationinclude echinacea (Echinacea spp.) and goldenseal\n(Hydrastis canadensis ). Ayurvedic medicine involves\nmeditation . There are also certain herbs and nutritional\nsupplements aimed at helping to treat ulcers.\nPrognosis\nThe discovery of H. pylori has improved the progno-\nsis for patients with gastritis and ulcers. Since treatmentexists to eradicate the infection, recurrence is much lesscommon. As of 1998, the only patients requiring treat-ment for H. pylori were those at high risk because of fac-\ntors such as NSAIDS use or for those with ulcers andother complicating factors or symptoms. Research willcontinue into the most effective treatment of H. pylori ,\nespecially in light of the bacterium’s resistance to certainantibiotics. Regular treatment of patients with gastric andduodenal ulcers has been recommended, since H. pyloriplays such a consistently high role in development ofulcers. It is believed that H. pylori also plays a role in the\neventual development of serious gastritis complicationsand cancer. Detection and treatment of H. pylori infec-\ntion may help reduce occurrence of these diseases. Theprognosis for patients with acute stress gastritis is muchpoorer, with a 60 percent or higher mortality rate amongthose bleeding heavily.\nPrevention\nThe widespread detection and treatment of H. pylori\nas a preventive measure in gastritis has been discussedbut not resolved. Until more is known about the routes\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1407Gastritisthrough which H. pylori is spread, specific prevention\nrecommendations are not available. Erosive gastritisfrom NSAIDS can be prevented with cessation of use ofthese drugs. An education campaign was launched in1998 to educate patients, particularly an aging popula-\ntion of arthritis sufferers, about risk for ulcers fromNSAIDS and alternative drugs.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBurton Goldberg Group.

    "title": "Gastroenteritis",
    "content": "Gastroenteritis\nDefinition\nGastroenteritis is a catchall term for infection or\nirritation of the digestive tract, particularly the stomachand intestine. It is frequently referred to as the stomachor intestinal flu, although the influenza virus is not\nassociated with this illness. Major symptoms includenausea and vomiting ,diarrhea , and abdominal\ncramps. These symptoms are sometimes also accompa-nied by fever and overall weakness. Gastroenteritis typi-\ncally lasts about three days. Adults usually recover with-out problem, but children, the elderly, and anyone withan underlying disease are more vulnerable to complica-tions such as dehydration .Description\nGastroenteritis is an uncomfortable and inconve-\nnient ailment, but it is rarely life-threatening in the Unit-ed States and other developed nations. However, an esti-mated 220,000 children younger than age five are hospi-talized with gastroenteritis symptoms in the UnitedStates annually. Of these children, 300 die as a result ofsevere diarrhea and dehydration. In developing nations,diarrheal illnesses are a major source of mortality. In1990, approximately three million deaths occurredworldwide as a result of diarrheal illness.\nThe most common cause of gastroenteritis is viral\ninfection. Viruses such as rotavirus, adenovirus, astro-virus, and calicivirus and small round-structured viruses(SRSVs) are found all over the world. Exposure typicallyoccurs through the fecal-oral route, such as by consum-ing foods contaminated by fecal material related to poorsanitation. However, the infective dose can be very low(approximately 100 virus particles), so other routes oftransmission are quite probable.\nTypically, children are more vulnerable to rotavirus-\nes, the most significant cause of acute watery diarrhea.Annually, worldwide, rotaviruses are estimated to cause800,000 deaths in children below age five. For this rea-son, much research has gone into developing a vaccine toprotect children from this virus. Adults can be infectedwith rotaviruses, but these infections typically have mini-mal or no symptoms.\nChildren are also susceptible to adenoviruses and\nastroviruses, which are minor causes of childhood gas-troenteritis. Adults experience illness from astrovirusesas well, but the major causes of adult viral gastroenteritisare the caliciviruses and SRSVs. These viruses alsocause illness in children. The SRSVs are a type of cali-civirus and include the Norwalk, Southhampton, andLonsdale viruses. These viruses are the most likely toproduce vomiting as a major symptom.\nBacterial gastroenteritis is frequently a result of poor\nsanitation, the lack of safe drinking water, or contaminat-ed food—conditions common in developing nations.Natural or man-made disasters can make underlyingproblems in sanitation and food safety worse. In devel-oped nations, the modern food production system poten-tially exposes millions of people to disease-causing bac-teria through its intensive production and distributionmethods. Common types of bacterial gastroenteritis canbe linked to Salmonella and Campylobacter bacteria;\nhowever, Escherichia coli 0157 and Listeria monocyto-\ngenes are creating increased concern in developed\nnations. Cholera and Shigella remain two diseases of\ngreat concern in developing countries, and research todevelop long-term vaccines against them is underway.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1408GastroenteritisCauses and symptoms\nGastroenteritis arises from ingestion of viruses, cer-\ntain bacteria, or parasites. Food that has spoiled may alsocause illness. Certain medications and excessive alcoholcan irritate the digestive tract to the point of inducinggastroenteritis. Regardless of the cause, the symptoms ofgastroenteritis include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting,and abdominal pain and cramps. Sufferers may also\nexperience bloating, low fever, and overall tiredness.Typically, the symptoms last only two to three days, butsome viruses may last up to a week.\nA usual bout of gastroenteritis shouldn’t require a\nvisit to the doctor. However, medical treatment is essen-tial if symptoms worsen or if there are complications.Infants, young children, the elderly, and persons withunderlying disease require special attention in this regard.\nThe greatest danger presented by gastroenteritis is\ndehydration. The loss of fluids through diarrhea andvomiting can upset the body’s electrolyte balance, lead-ing to potentially life-threatening problems such as heartbeat abnormalities (arrhythmia). The risk of dehydrationincreases as symptoms are prolonged. Dehydrationshould be suspected if a dry mouth , increased or exces-\nsive thirst, or scanty urination is experienced.\nIf symptoms do not resolve within a week, an infec-\ntion or disorder more serious than gastroenteritis may beinvolved. Symptoms of great concern include a high fever(102° F [38.9°C] or above), blood or mucus in the diarrhea,blood in the vomit, and severe abdominal pain or swelling.These symptoms require prompt medical attention.\nDiagnosis\nThe symptoms of gastroenteritis are usually enough\nto identify the illness. Unless there is an outbreak affect-ing several people or complications are encountered in aparticular case, identifying the specific cause of the ill-ness is not a priority. However, if identification of theinfectious agent is required, a stool sample will be col-lected and analyzed for the presence of viruses, disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria, or parasites.\nTreatment\nGastroenteritis is a self-limiting illness which will\nresolve by itself. However, for comfort and convenience,a person may use over-the-counter medications such asPepto Bismol to relieve the symptoms. These medica-tions work by altering the ability of the intestine to moveor secrete spontaneously, absorbing toxins and water, oraltering intestinal microflora. Some over-the-countermedicines use more than one element to treat symptoms.If over-the-counter medications are ineffective and\nmedical treatment is sought, a doctor may prescribe amore powerful anti-diarrheal drug, such as motofen orlomotil. Should pathogenic bacteria or parasites be iden-tified in the patient’s stool sample, medications such asantibiotics will be prescribed.\nIt is important to stay hydrated and nourished during a\nbout of gastroenteritis. If dehydration is absent, the drink-ing of generous amounts of nonalcoholic fluids, such aswater or juice, is adequate. Caffeine , since it increases\nurine output, should be avoided. The traditional BRATdiet—bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast—is tolerated bythe tender gastrointestinal system, but it is not particularlynutritious. Many, but not all, medical researchers recom-mend a diet that includes complex carbohydrates (e.g., rice,wheat, potatoes, bread, and cereal), lean meats, yogurt,fruit, and vegetables. Milk and other dairy products should-n’t create problems if they are part of the normal diet. Fattyfoods or foods with a lot of sugar should be avoided. Theserecommendations are based on clinical experience andcontrolled trials, but are not universally accepted.\nMinimal to moderate dehydration is treated with oral\nrehydrating solutions that contain glucose and electrolytes.These solutions are commercially available under namessuch as Naturalyte, Pedialyte, Infalyte, and Rehydralyte.Oral rehydrating solutions are formulated based on physi-ological properties. Fluids that are not based on theseproperties—such as cola, apple juice, broth, and sportsbeverages—are not recommended to treat dehydration. Ifvomiting interferes with oral rehydration, small frequentfluid intake may be better tolerated. Should oral rehydra-tion fail or severe dehydration occur, medical treatment inthe form of intravenous (IV) therapy is required. IV thera-py can be followed with oral rehydration as the patient’scondition improves. Once normal hydration is achieved,the patient can return to a regular diet.\nAlternative treatment\nSymptoms of uncomplicated gastroenteritis can be\nrelieved with adjustments in diet, herbal remedies, andhomeopathy . An infusion of meadowsweet ( Filipendula\nulmaria ) may be effective in reducing nausea and stom-\nach acidity. Once the worst symptoms are relieved, slip-pery elm ( Ulmus fulva ) can help calm the digestive tract.\nOf the homeopathic remedies available, Arsenicum\nalbum ,ipecac , or Nux vomica are three said to relieve the\nsymptoms of gastroenteritis.\nProbiotics, bacteria that are beneficial to a person’s\nhealth, are recommended during the recovery phase of gas-troenteritis. Specifically, live cultures of Lactobacillus aci-\ndophilus are said to be effective in soothing the digestive\ntract and returning the intestinal flora to normal. L. aci-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1409Gastroenteritisdophilus is found in live-culture yogurt, as well as in cap-\nsule or powder form at health food stores. The use of probi-otics is found in folk remedies and has some support in themedical literature. Castor oil packs to the abdomen canreduce inflammation and also reduce spasms or discomfort.\nPrognosis\nGastroenteritis is usually resolved within two to\nthree days and there are no long-term effects. If dehydra-tion occurs, recovery is extended by a few days.\nPrevention\nThere are few steps that can be taken to avoid gas-\ntroenteritis. Ensuring that food is well-cooked andunspoiled can prevent bacterial gastroenteritis, but maynot be effective against viral gastroenteritis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMidthun, Karen, and Albert Z.

Thetube is used for feeding or drainage.\nPurpose\nGastrostomy is performed because a patient tem-\nporarily or permanently needs to be fed directly througha tube in the stomach. Reasons for feeding by gastrosto-my include birth defects of the mouth, esophagus, or\nstomach, and problems sucking or swallowing.\nGastrostomy is also performed to provide drainage\nfor the stomach when it is necessary to bypass a long-standing obstruction of the stomach outlet into the smallintestine. Obstructions may be caused by peptic ulcerscarring or a tumor.\nPrecautions\nGastrostomy is a relatively simple procedure. As with\nany surgery, patients are more likely to experience compli-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1410Gastrostomycations if they are smokers, obese, use alcohol heavily, or\nuse illicit drugs. In addition, some prescription medica-tions may increase risks associated with anesthesia.\nDescription\nGastrostomy, also called gastrostomy tube insertion,\nis surgery performed by a general surgeon to give anexternal opening into the stomach. Surgery is performedeither when the patient is under general anesthesia—where the patient feels as if he is in a deep sleep and hasno awareness of what is happening—or under local anes-thesia. With local anesthesia, the patient is awake, but thepart of the body cut during the operation is numbed.\nA small incision is made on the left side of the\nabdomen; then, an incision is made through the stomach.A small, flexible, hollow tube, usually made ofpolyvinylchloride or rubber, is inserted into the stomach.The stomach is stitched closed around the tube, and theincision is closed. The procedure is performed at a hospi-tal or free-standing surgery center.\nThe length of time the patient needs to remain in the\nhospital depends on the age of the patient and thepatient’s general health. In some cases, the hospital staycan be as short as one day, but often is longer. Normally,the stomach and abdomen heal in five to seven days.\nThe cost of the surgery varies, depending on the age\nand health of the patient. Younger, sicker patients requiremore intensive, thus more expensive, care.\nPreparation\nPrior to the operation, the doctor will perform\nendoscopy and take x rays of the gastrointestinal tract.Blood and urine tests will also be performed, and the\npatient may meet with the anesthesiologist to evaluateany special conditions that might affect the administra-tion of anesthesia.\nAftercare\nImmediately after the operation, the patient is fed\nintravenously for at least 24 hours. Once bowel soundsare heard, indicating that the gastrointestinal system isworking, the patient can begin clear liquid feedingsthrough the tube. Gradually feedings are increased.\nPatient education concerning use and care of the\ngastrostomy tube is very important. Patients and theirfamilies are taught how to recognize and prevent infec-tion around the tube, how to feed through the tube, howto handle tube blockage, what to do if the tube pulls out,and what normal activities can be continued.\nRisks\nThere are few risks associated with this surgery.

    "title": "Gaucher disease",
    "content": "Gaucher disease\nDefinition\nGaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder that\nresults in accumulation of fatty molecules called cerebro-sides. It can have serious effects on numerous bodyorgans including the liver, spleen, bones and central ner-vous system. Treatments based on molecular biology arebecoming available, but are very expensive.\nDescription\nGaucher disease was first described by the French\nphysician Philippe Gaucher in 1882. It is the most com-mon of a class of diseases called lysosomal storage dis-eases, each of which is characterized by the accumulationof a specific chemical substance (a different substancedepending on the exact disease). Gaucher disease is char-acterized by a wide array of different symptoms and theseverity of the disease ranges from undetectable to lethal.\nThree forms of the disease are recognized: Types I,\nII and III. Type I is by far the most common and showsthe mildest symptoms. It is non-neuronopathic, meaningthat the nervous system is not attacked. The onset ofType I can occur at any age in childhood or adult lifewith the average age of onset at about 21 years. Someaffected individuals are have no symptoms throughoutadult life. Type II, the infantile form, accounts for lessthan 1% of patients with Gaucher disease. It is neurono-pathic (attacks the nervous system); nervous systemeffects are severe, and victims often die within the firstyear of life. Type III most often has its onset duringchildhood and has some of the features of both the adultand infantile forms. This affects less than 5% of personswith Gaucher disease.KEY TERMS\nEndoscopy —A procedure in which an instrument\ncontaining a camera is inserted into the gastroin-testinal tract so that the doctor can visually inspectthe gastrointestinal system.Gaucher disease is caused by the absence, or near\nabsence, of activity of an enzyme called glucocerebrosi-dase (GC). The normal action of GC is to break down acommon molecule called glucocerebroside. If not brokendown, glucocerebroside accumulates in certain cells tolevels that can cause damage, especially in the spleen,liver, and bone. The common link among these organs isthat they house a cell type called a macrophage. Amacrophage is a large cell that surrounds and consumes aforeign substance (such as bacteria) in the body. The cel-lular structures in which glucocerebroside accumulatesare called lysosomes.\nThe three forms of Gaucher disease also differ in\ntheir population genetics. Type I is most common in per-sons of eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent.Among this population, the disease occurs at a rate ofone in 450 live births and about one in 10 to 15 personsare carriers, making it the most common genetic diseaseaffecting Jewish people. The other two types are equallyfrequent in all ethnic groups. Type II occurs at a rate ofone in 100,000 live births, while Type III is estimated tooccur in one in 50,000 live births.\nCauses and symptoms\nLack of the GC enzyme is caused by a mutation in the\nglucocerebrosidase gene. The gene is located on chromo-some 1. As of 2000, there have been over 100 mutationsdescribed in this gene that causes Gaucher disease. Gauch-er disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.This means that two defective gene copies must be inherit-ed, one from each parent, for the disease to manifest itself.Persons with only one gene mutation are carriers for thedisorder. A person who is a carrier for Gaucher diseasedoes not have any symptoms and does not know he or sheis a carrier unless he or she has had specific testing. Whenboth parents are carriers for Gaucher disease, there is a onein four chance (25%) in each pregnancy for a child to\nhave Gaucher disease. There is a two in three chance that ahealthy sibling of an affected child is a carrier.\nThe results of Gaucher disease are widespread in the\nbody and include excessive growth of the liver andspleen (hepatosplenomegaly), weakening of bones, and,in acute cases, severe nervous system damage. Manypatients experience “bone crises,” which are episodes ofextreme pain in their bones.\nThere is a wide array of other problems that occur\nwith Gaucher disease, such as anemia (fewer than normalred blood cells). Just how these other symptoms arecaused is not known. Nor is it known why some patientshave very mild disease and others have much more sig-nificant problems. Even identical twins with the diseasecan have differing symptoms.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1412Gaucher diseaseDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of Gaucher disease, based initially on the\nsymptoms described above, can be confirmed by micro-scopic, enzymatic, and molecular tests. Biopsy (surgicalremoval of tissue from a problem area) of tissue is help-ful for microscopic diagnosis. When biopsy tissue isexamined under the microscope, cells will appearswollen and will show characteristic features of the cyto-plasm (part of the cell body along with the nucleus) andnucleus. Enzyme tests will show deficiency (<30% ofnormal levels) of the enzyme GC. Molecular analysis ofDNA samples looking at four of the more common muta-tions will show defects in the gene for GC in 95% ofAshkenazi Jewish individuals and in 75% of non-Jewishpeople. Diagnosis can be performed prenatally (beforebirth) if the parents’ mutations are known using amnio-\ncentesis or chorionic villus sampling .\nDiagnosis as to which of the three types of Gaucher\ndisease an individual has is based on the symptoms,rather than on test results.\nTreatment\nUntil the 1990s, only supportive therapy could be\noffered. Analgesics are used to control pain. Orthopedic\ntreatment is used for bone fractures . In some cases, sur-\ngical removal of the spleen may be necessary. Severaltreatments for anemia have been used, including vitaminand iron supplements, blood transfusions, and bone mar-row transplants.\nThe newest form of treatment for Gaucher disease is\nenzyme replacement therapy, in which GC can be admin-istered intravenously. The enzyme can be prepared eitherby purification from placentas (alglucerase) or by recom-binant DNA manufacturing techniques (imiglucerase).Either way, the cost of treatment ranges from $100,000to $400,000 per year, which can prevent many fromobtaining treatment.\nEnzyme replacement is effective at reducing most\nGaucher symptoms. The notable exception is neurologicdamage in Type II disease, which remains unimprovedby this treatment. This treatment is not recommended forindividuals who are asymptomatic. As of 2000, the effi-cacy for the treatment of Type III Gaucher disease is notknown. Many questions remain about enzyme replace-ment therapy in regard to dosage, and method and fre-quency of administration. The treatment program shouldbe individualized for each patient.\nPrognosis\nA patient’s expected lifespan varies greatly with the\ntype of Gaucher disease. Infants with Type II disease haveKEY TERMS\nCerebrosides —Fatty carbohydrates that occur in\nthe brain and nervous system.\nEnzymatic replacement therapy —A treatment\nmethod used to replace missing enzymes. It ispossible to synthesize enzymes and then injectthem intravenously into patients.\nGlucocerebroside —A cerebroside that contains\nglucose in the molecule.\na life span of one to four years. Patients with Types I and\nIII of the disease have highly variable outcomes withsome patients dying in childhood and others living fulllives. Little is known about the reasons for this variability.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is advised for individuals with\nGaucher disease and for their relatives to accuratelyassess risk and discuss testing options. For couples whopreviously had a child with Gaucher or in situationswhere both parents are carriers for known Gaucher muta-tions, prenatal diagnosis is available to determinewhether a pregnancy is affected. Families in which a per-son has been diagnosed with Gaucher disease can haveDNA testing, which enables other relatives to determinetheir carrier status. Prospective parents can then use thatinformation to conduct family planning or to prepare fora child who may have special circumstances.\nFamilies in which both parents are known to be a\ncarrier of a mutation for Gaucher disease could considerpreimplantation genetic diagnosis. This relatively newprocedure can select an embryo without both Gaucherdisease mutations prior to implantation of the embryointo the uterus. This technique is only available at select-ed genetics centers.\nAs of 2000, population screening for Gaucher dis-\nease is not standard of care.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nBeutler, E. “Gaucher Disease.” Archives of Internal Medicine\n159 (1999): 881-2.\nCharrow, J., et al. “Gaucher Disease: Recommendations on\nDiagnosis, Evaluation, and Monitoring.” Archives of\nInternal Medicine 158 (1998): 1754-1760.\nGrabowski, Gregory A. “Current Issues in Enzyme Therapy for\nGaucher Disease.” Drugs 52 (August 1996): 159-167.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1413Gaucher diseaseNIH Technology Assessment Conference. “Gaucher Disease:\nCurrent Issues in Diagnosis and Treatment.” JAMA 275\n(February 12, 1996): 548-553.\nORGANIZATIONS\nAlliance of Genetic Support Groups. 4301 Connecticut Ave.\nNW, Suite 404, Washington, DC 20008.

    "title": "Gay and lesbian health",
    "content": "Gay and lesbian health\nDefinition\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)\nindividuals are as diverse as the general population interms of race, ethnicity, age, religion, education, income,and family history. A number of health concerns areunique to or shared by the LGBT community, however,including an increased risk of certain cancers, infectiousand sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and mental\nhealth disorders; issues relating to nutrition and weight,\ntobacco use, and substance abuse; and discrimination byhealth care and insurance providers.\nDescription\nThe definitions of different sexual identities have\nshifted over the years, as have the perceptions and stereo-types of the general population. Because of the widerange of behaviors and identities that exist in the LGBTcommunity, it is difficult to develop an inclusive defini-tion. It is generally accepted, however, that gay men andlesbians are sexually attracted to or participate in sexualbehaviors with individuals of the same gender, whilebisexual men and women are sexually attracted to or par-ticipate in sexual behaviors with individuals of both gen-ders. Transgender individuals live part- or full-time in agender role opposite to their genetic sex.\nIt is estimated that approximately 2.8% of men and\n1.4% of women identify as being gay, lesbian, or bisexu-al while 9.1% of men and 4.3% of women have partici-pated in sexual behavior with someone of the same gen-der at least once. The true extent of the transgender com-munity has not been well researched in the United States;one study from the Netherlands in 1993 found that one in11,900 males and one in 30,400 females are transgender.\nThere are a number of issues that arise when trying\nto define sexual orientation. Many gay men and lesbianshave participated in or continue to participate in sexualactivities with members of the opposite sex but choosenot to identify as heterosexuals or bisexuals. Others havenever participated in sexual activities at all yet still iden-tify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Some men and womenidentifying as bisexuals are in long-term, monogamousrelationships with individuals of the same or oppositesex. Male-to-female (MTF) or female-to-male (FTM)transgender individuals may or may not identify them-selves as gay or lesbian.\nThe implications of these identity issues are far-\nreaching. Misdiagnoses or improper medical recommen-dations might come from health care providers who havemistakenly assumed sexual behaviors or risks from thepatient’s stated identity. For example, a provider mightincorrectly assume that a lesbian patient has never hadsexual intercourse with a male and therefore would nothave contracted STDs not normally transmitted by sexualactivities between women. It has been difficult to closelyestimate the numbers of LGBT individuals in the UnitedStates because of varying definitions. Likewise, the sta-tistics in medical or social studies and surveys on LGBTissues might vary widely depending on what definitionswere provided for the respondents. Because of this, manyresearchers have opted for the more inclusive terms of“men who have sex with men” (MSM) and “women whohave sex with women” (WSW) to categorize gay, les-bian, and bisexual respondents.\nImportant health care issues\nMany LGBT individuals have difficulty revealing\ntheir sexual identity (“coming out”) to their health careproviders. They may fear discrimination from providersor believe that their confidentiality might be breached. Insome cases health care workers have been poorly trainedto address the needs of LGBT individuals or have diffi-culty communicating with their LGBT patient (one study\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1414Gay and lesbian healthindicated that 40% of physicians are uncomfortable pro-\nviding care for gay or lesbian patients). In addition, manyquestions posed in questionnaires or examinations areheterosexually biased (e.g. asking a lesbian which birthcontrol methods she uses or a gay man if he is married,single, or divorced).\nOther reasons why LGBT individuals are often hesi-\ntant to share their sexual identity are more logistical.Many insurance companies deny benefits to long-termpartners on the basis that they are not married. LGBTpatients may have inadequate access to health care, eitherbecause they live in a remote rural area or in the crowdedinner city. Some same-sex partners encounter discrimina-tion in hospitals and clinics when they are denied therights usually given to spouses of a patient such as visit-ing, making medical decisions, and participating in con-sultations with physicians.\nSome of the health concerns and risk factors that are\nrelevant to LBGT individuals may be shared by the gener-al population, while others are more specific to the LGBTcommunity, and still others are specific to different sub-groups of LGBT individuals. These health concerns maybe grouped into the following areas of concern:\n• Sexual behavior issues: STDs such as human immun-\nodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune defi-\nciency syndrome ( AIDS ),hepatitis A virus (HA V),\nhepatitis B virus (HBV), bacterial vaginosis, gonor-\nrhea , chlamydia, and genital warts (human papillo-\nmavirus or HPV); anal, ovarian, and cervical cancer .\n• Cultural issues: body image, nutrition, weight, and eat-\ning disorders; drug and alcohol abuse; tobacco use; par-enting and family planning.\n• Discrimination issues: inadequate medical care; harass-\nment at work, school, or home; difficulty in obtaininghousing, insurance coverage, or child custody; vio-lence.\n• Sexual identity issues: conflicts with family, friends,\nand work mates; psychological issues such as anxiety ,\ndepression, and suicide; economic hardship.\nCANCER. Cancer is the second leading cause of\ndeath in the United States. In 2000, it was estimated that\n1,220,100 individuals were diagnosed with cancer and552,200 lost their lives as a result. LBGT individuals areat an increased risk for certain types of cancers. Someresearchers believe that those who do not disclose theirsexual identity live with an added stress that suppresses\nthe immune system, thus leaving them with an increasedrisk of tumor growth.\nSeveral studies have indicated that lesbians have\nhigher risk for developing breast cancer . This is partial-\nly related to higher rates of risk factors such as obesity ,alcohol use, tobacco use, and nulliparity (not bearing\nchildren). It has also been shown that lesbians are lesslikely to be screened for breast cancer than heterosexualwomen. Lesbians also have additional risk of developingovarian cancer , due to inadequate access to health care,\nnulliparity, and not using oral contraceptives (use of\noral contraceptives has been shown to decrease the riskof getting ovarian cancer).\nGay and bisexual men (or more generally, men who\nhave sex with men [MSM]) are at higher risk of develop-ing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease , and\nanal cancer . Kaposi’s sarcoma , an AIDS-associated\ncancer, used to be found in the gay community at ratesthousands of times more than the general populationbefore more effective antiretroviral drugs became\navailable for people infected with HIV . Anal cancer isassociated with transmission of human papillomavirus(HPV); a 1998 study indicated 73% of HIV-positive and23% of HIV-negative MSM were infected with morethan one type of HPV . The risk factors associated withMSM are also associated with increased rates of analcancer (i.e. smoking , having many sexual partners, and\nreceiving anal intercourse).\nAIDS. As of 2000, more than 753,900 individuals\nhave been diagnosed with AIDS in the United States; oftotal cases, 84% are men, 16% are women, and 1% arechildren 12 years old or younger. The major risk groupsassociated with AIDS transmission are MSM whoengage in high-risk sexual behaviors, intravenous drugusers (IDUs) who share needles, heterosexuals whoengage in high-risk sexual behaviors, inmates at correc-tional facilities, and neonates (newborns) whose mothersare infected with HIV .\nApproximately 54% of cumulative AIDS cases are\nmen who have sex with men. MSM also constitute 38%of newly reported HIV cases each year. An annualdecrease has occurred in the number of reported AIDS-related deaths, partially attributable to the developmentof advanced therapies that are extending the lifeexpectancies of AIDS patients. These new treatments,however, have inadvertently caused decreased rates ofsafe sex practices; one 1998 study revealed that 18% ofHIV-positive men were having safe sex less often sinceadvances in treatment.\nFew studies have looked at the transmission of HIV\nin women who have sex with women (WSW). HIV trans-mission might occur in WSW because of intercoursewith males or intravenous drug use. Several small studiesconducted in the 1990s found no evidence of HIV trans-mission from sexual activities between women.\nOTHER STDS. It is estimated that 333 million cases\nof curable STDs occur each year worldwide. Among the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1415Gay and lesbian healthmost commonly found STDs in the United States are\nchlamydia, gonorrhea, AIDS, syphilis , and hepatitis B\nvirus (HBV). Over 15 million new infections are estimat-ed to occur each year in the United State, with approxi-mately four million of those occurring in adolescents.\nMSM are at most risk of developing urethritis\n(inflammation of the urethra), proctitis (inflammation of\nthe rectum), pharyngitis (inflammation of the cavity atthe back of the mouth), gonorrhea, chlamydia, HA V ,HBV , syphilis, herpes, and HPV . HA V and HBV are bothvaccine-preventable viruses but rates of vaccination\namong MSM are low; in 1996 the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) found that only 3% ofMSM had been vaccinated against HBV . In May 2001the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anew vaccine that combines the HA V and HBV in one,with hopes that vaccination rates will increase.\nIt appears that STDs are less common in women\nwho have sex only with women than in bisexual or het-erosexual women. Genital warts ,trichomoniasis , and\nbacterial vaginosis are transmittable during sexual activi-ty between women. Chlamydia, herpes, syphilis, gonor-rhea, and HA V are also able to be transmitted betweenwomen, although at lower rates.\nMENTAL HEALTH. Forty million Americans are esti-\nmated to be diagnosed with a mental disorder, a conditionin which abnormalities in thought, feeling, and/or behav-ior cause distress or impair function. Of these, only 25%seek and obtain care from mental health professionals.\nHomosexuality was labeled as a mental disorder\nuntil 1973 when it was declassified by the American Psy-chiatric Association; in 1986 “ego-dystonic homosexual-ity” was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). More recently,\nstudies have shown that LGBT individuals are atincreased risk of depression, panic attacks, substanceabuse, and suicide. MSM have been shown to have high-er rates of depression, anxiety, and conduct disorder\nthan heterosexual males, although not much study hasbeen done in this area. WSW have been shown to haveincreased rates of alcohol and drug abuse.\nGender identity disorder is defined as “a strong\nand persistent cross-gender identification...manifested bysymptoms such as a stated desire to be the other sex, fre-quently passing as the other sex, desire to live or be treat-ed as the other sex, or the conviction that he or she as thetypical feelings and reactions of the other sex” (DSM-IV ,302.85). Transvestic fetishism is defined as involving“recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexualurges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing” (DSM-IV ,302.3). Both disorders lead to a “disturbance that causesclinically significant distress or impairment in social,occupational, or other important areas of functioning.”\nThis last point iterates that transgender individuals notautomatically considered under DSM-IV to have a men-tal disorder.\nNUTRITION AND WEIGHT. Diet and nutritional fac-\ntors are associated with a number of diseases includingcancer, stroke , diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis .\nIt has been shown that lesbians are more likely than het-erosexual women to be obese, have a higher body massindex (BMI), and have higher rates of smoking, but arealso more likely to have a healthier body image (42%compared to 21% of heterosexual women). Gay men andadolescents, on the other hand, have been shown to haveincreased rates of eating disorder behaviors than hetero-sexual men; examples are binge eating (25% comparedto 11%), purging behaviors (12% to 4%), and poor bodyimage (28% to 12%).\nSUBSTANCE AND TOBACCO USE. Marijuana and\ncocaine use has been shown to be higher among lesbians\nthan heterosexual women. The incidence of the use ofsome drugs is higher in gay men than heterosexual men;these include marijuana, psychedelic drugs, ecstasy, bar-bituates, and stimulants such as amyl or butyl nitrate(“poppers”). There is some indication that the use ofsome illicit drugs speeds up the replication of HIV ,although more research needs to be done in this area.\nCigarette smoking is responsible for 430,000 deaths a\nyear in the United States, with an estimated 3,000 non-smokers dying as a result of exposure to secondhandsmoke. In 1997 the rate of smoking among all adults was25%. In contrast, 36% of gay men and lesbians were notedto be smokers. Lesbians are more than two times as likelyto become heavy smokers than heterosexual women.\nPrevention\nThere are numerous ways that health care providers\ncan improve the access to and experience of health careservices for LGBT individuals. These include:\n• rewording questionnaires and examinations to be inclu-\nsive of LGBT patients\n• providing referrals to social service agencies and coun-\nseling services that are LGBT-friendly\n• taking educational courses that are sensitive to the\nneeds of LGBT patients\n• treating the families of LGBT patients as one would the\nfamilies of heterosexual patients\n• maintaining the strictest code of confidentiality\n• developing and maintaining health care centers or clin-\nics that address LGBT-specific needs\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1416Gay and lesbian health• asking non-threatening questions to determine if a per-\nson is at risk of an STD\n• educating patients of risk factors associated with STDs,\npossible vaccines, and treatments available\n• providing services to individuals in the process of dis-\nclosing their sexual identity and, if applicable, theirfamilies\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nGay and Lesbian Medical Association. 459 Fulton Street, Suite\n107, San Francisco, CA 94102.

    "title": "Gender identity disorder",
    "content": "Gender identity disorder\nDefinition\nThe psychological diagnosis gender identity disor-\nder (GID) is used to describe a male or female that feels astrong identification with the opposite sex and experi-ences considerable distress because of their actual sex.\nDescription\nGender identity disorder can affect children, adoles-\ncents, and adults. Individuals with gender identity disor-der have strong cross-gender identification. They believethat they are, or should be, the opposite sex. They areuncomfortable with their sexual role and organs and mayexpress a desire to alter their bodies. While not all per-sons with GID are labeled as transsexuals, there are thosewho are determined to undergo sex change procedures orhave done so, and, therefore, are classified as transsexu-al. They often attempt to pass socially as the oppositesex. Transsexuals alter their physical appearance cosmet-ically and hormonally, and may eventually undergo asex-change operation.\nChildren with gender identity disorder refuse to\ndress and act in sex-stereotypical ways. It is important toremember that many emotionally healthy children expe-rience fantasies about being a member of the oppositesex. The distinction between these children and genderidentity disordered children is that the latter experiencesignificant interference in functioning because of theircross-gender identification. They may become severelydepressed, anxious, or socially withdrawn.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of gender identity disorder is not known.\nIt has been theorized that a prenatal hormonal imbalancemay predispose individuals to the disorder. Problems inthe individual’s family interactions or family dynamicshave also been postulated as having some causal impact.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ), the diagnostic ref-\nerence standard for United States mental health profes-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1417Gender identity disordersionals, describes the criteria for gender identity disorder\nas an individual’s strong and lasting cross-gender identi-fication and their persistent discomfort with their biolog-ical gender role. This discomfort must cause a significantamount of distress or impairment in the functioning ofthe individual.\nDSM-IV specifies that children must display at least\nfour of the following symptoms of cross-gender identifi-cation for a diagnosis of gender identity disorder:\n• a repeatedly stated desire to be, or insistence that he or\nshe is, the opposite sex\n• a preference for cross-dressing\n• a strong and lasting preference to play make-believe and\nrole-playing games as a member of the opposite sex orpersistent fantasies that he or she is the opposite sex\n• a strong desire to participate in the stereotypical games\nof the opposite sex\n• a strong preference for friends and playmates of the\nopposite sex\nDiagnosis\nGender identity disorder is typically diagnosed by a\npsychiatrist or psychologist, who conducts an interviewwith the patient and takes a detailed social history. Fami-ly members may also be interviewed during the assess-ment process. This evaluation usually takes place in anoutpatient setting.\nTreatment\nTreatment for children with gender identity disor-\nder focuses on treating secondary problems such asKEY TERMS\nCross-dressing —Dressing in clothing that is\nstereotypical of the opposite sex.\nGender identity disorder (GID) —A strong and\nlasting cross-gender identification and persistentdiscomfort with one’s biological gender (sex) role.This discomfort must cause a significant amount ofdistress or impairment in the functioning of theindividual.\nTranssexual —A person with gender identity disor-\nder who has an overwhelming desire to changeanatomic sex; one who seeks hormonal or surgicaltreatment to change sex.depression and anxiety , and improving self-esteem.\nTreatment may also work on instilling positive identifi-cations with the child’s biological gender. Childrentypically undergo psychosocial therapy sessions; theirparents may also be referred for family or individualtherapy.\nTranssexual adults often request hormone and surgi-\ncal treatments to suppress their biological sex character-istics and acquire those of the opposite sex. A team ofhealth professionals, including the treating psychologistor psychiatrist, medical doctors, and several surgical spe-cialists, oversee this transitioning process. Because of theirreversible nature of the surgery, candidates for sex-change surgery are evaluated extensively and are oftenrequired to spend a period of time integrating themselvesinto the cross-gender role before the procedure begins.Counseling and peer support are also invaluable to trans-sexual individuals.\nPrognosis\nLong-term follow up studies have shown positive\nresults for many transsexuals who have undergone sex-change surgery. However, significant social, personal,and occupational issues may result from surgical sexchanges, and the patient may require psychotherapy orcounseling.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Genes control heredity and provide the basic bio-logical code for determining a cell’s specific functions.Gene therapy seeks to provide genes that correct or sup-plant the disease-controlling functions of cells that arenot, in essence, doing their job. Somatic gene therapyintroduces therapeutic genes at the tissue or cellular levelto treat a specific individual. Germ-line gene therapyinserts genes into reproductive cells or possibly intoembryos to correct genetic defects that could be passedon to future generations. Initially conceived as anapproach for treating inherited diseases, like cystic\nfibrosis and Huntington’s disease, the scope of potential\ngene therapies has grown to include treatments for can-cers, arthritis, and infectious diseases. Although genetherapy testing in humans has advanced rapidly, manyquestions surround its use. For example, some scientistsare concerned that the therapeutic genes themselves maycause disease. Others fear that germ-line gene therapymay be used to control human development in ways notconnected with disease, like intelligence or appearance.\nThe biological basis of gene therapy\nGene therapy has grown out of the science of genet-\nics or how heredity works. Scientists know that lifebegins in a cell, the basic building block of all multicellu-lar organisms. Humans, for instance, are made up of tril-lions of cells, each performing a specific function. With-in the cell’s nucleus (the center part of a cell that regu-lates its chemical functions) are pairs of chromosomes.These threadlike structures are made up of a single mole-cule of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which carries theblueprint of life in the form of codes, or genes, that deter-mine inherited characteristics.\nA DNA molecule looks like two ladders with one of\nthe sides taken off both and then twisted around eachother. The rungs of these ladders meet (resulting in a spi-ral staircase-like structure) and are called base pairs.Base pairs are made up of nitrogen molecules andarranged in specific sequences. Millions of these basepairs, or sequences, can make up a single gene, specifi-cally defined as a segment of the chromosome and DNAthat contains certain hereditary information. The gene, orcombination of genes formed by these base pairs ulti-mately direct an organism’s growth and characteristicsthrough the production of certain chemicals, primarilyproteins, which carry out most of the body’s chemicalfunctions and biological reactions.Scientists have long known that alterations in genes\npresent within cells can cause inherited diseases like cys-tic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia, and hemophilia . Similar-\nly, errors in the total number of chromosomes can causeconditions such as Down syndrome or Turner’s syn-\ndrome. As the study of genetics advanced, however, sci-entists learned that an altered genetic sequence can alsomake people more susceptible to diseases, like athero-\nsclerosis ,cancer , and even schizophrenia . These dis-\neases have a genetic component, but are also influencedby environmental factors (like diet and lifestyle). Theobjective of gene therapy is to treat diseases by introduc-ing functional genes into the body to alter the cellsinvolved in the disease process by either replacing miss-ing genes or providing copies of functioning genes toreplace nonfunctioning ones. The inserted genes can benaturally-occurring genes that produce the desired effector may be genetically engineered (or altered) genes.\nScientists have known how to manipulate a gene’s\nstructure in the laboratory since the early 1970s througha process called gene splicing. The process involvesremoving a fragment of DNA containing the specificgenetic sequence desired, then inserting it into the DNAof another gene. The resultant product is called recombi-nant DNA and the process is genetic engineering.\nThere are basically two types of gene therapy.\nGerm-line gene therapy introduces genes into reproduc-tive cells (sperm and eggs) or someday possibly intoembryos in hopes of correcting genetic abnormalitiesthat could be passed on to future generations. Most of thecurrent work in applying gene therapy, however, hasbeen in the realm of somatic gene therapy. In this type ofgene therapy, therapeutic genes are inserted into tissue orcells to produce a naturally occurring protein or sub-stance that is lacking or not functioning correctly in anindividual patient.\nViral vectors\nIn both types of therapy, scientists need something to\ntransport either the entire gene or a recombinant DNA tothe cell’s nucleus, where the chromosomes and DNAreside. In essence, vectors are molecular delivery trucks.One of the first and most popular vectors developed wereviruses because they invade cells as part of the naturalinfection process. Viruses have the potential to be excel-lent vectors because they have a specific relationship withthe host in that they colonize certain cell types and tissuesin specific organs. As a result, vectors are chosen accord-ing to their attraction to certain cells and areas of the body.\nOne of the first vectors used was retroviruses.\nBecause these viruses are easily cloned (artificiallyreproduced) in the laboratory, scientists have studied\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1419Gene therapythem extensively and learned a great deal about their bio-\nlogical action. They have also learned how to remove thegenetic information which governs viral replication, thusreducing the chances of infection.\nRetroviruses work best in actively dividing cells, but\ncells in the body are relatively stable and do not divideoften. As a result, these cells are used primarily for ex\nvivo (outside the body) manipulation. First, the cells are\nremoved from the patient’s body, and the virus, or vector,carrying the gene is inserted into them. Next, the cells areplaced into a nutrient culture where they grow and repli-cate. Once enough cells are gathered, they are returned tothe body, usually by injection into the blood stream. The-oretically, as long as these cells survive, they will providethe desired therapy.\nAnother class of viruses, called the adenoviruses,\nmay also prove to be good gene vectors. These virusescan effectively infect nondividing cells in the body,where the desired gene product is then expressed natural-ly. In addition to being a more efficient approach to genetransportation, these viruses, which cause respiratoryinfections, are more easily purified and made stable thanretroviruses, resulting in less chance of an unwanted viralinfection. However, these viruses live for several days inthe body, and some concern surrounds the possibility ofinfecting others with the viruses through sneezing orcoughing. Other viral vectors include influenza viruses,\nSindbis virus, and a herpes virus that infects nerve cells.\nScientists have also delved into nonviral vectors.\nThese vectors rely on the natural biological process inwhich cells uptake (or gather) macromolecules. Oneapproach is to use liposomes, globules of fat produced bythe body and taken up by cells. Scientists are also investi-gating the introduction of raw recombinant DNA byinjecting it into the bloodstream or placing it on micro-scopic beads of gold shot into the skin with a “gene-gun.” Another possible vector under development isbased on dendrimer molecules. A class of polymers (nat-urally occurring or artificial substances that have a highmolecular weight and formed by smaller molecules ofthe same or similar substances), is “constructed” in thelaboratory by combining these smaller molecules. Theyhave been used in manufacturing Styrofoam, polyethyl-ene cartons, and Plexiglass. In the laboratory, dendrimershave shown the ability to transport genetic material intohuman cells. They can also be designed to form an affini-ty for particular cell membranes by attaching to certainsugars and protein groups.\nThe history of gene therapy\nIn the early 1970s, scientists proposed “gene\nsurgery” for treating inherited diseases caused by faultygenes. The idea was to take out the disease-causing gene\nand surgically implant a gene that functioned properly.Although sound in theory, scientists, then and now, lackthe biological knowledge or technical expertise neededto perform such a precise surgery in the human body.\nHowever, in 1983, a group of scientists from Baylor\nCollege of Medicine in Houston, Texas, proposed thatgene therapy could one day be a viable approach fortreating Lesch-Nyhan disease, a rare neurological disor-der. The scientists conducted experiments in which anenzyme-producing gene (a specific type of protein) forcorrecting the disease was injected into a group of cellsfor replication. The scientists theorized the cells couldthen be injected into people with Lesch-Nyhan disease,thus correcting the genetic defect that caused the disease.\nAs the science of genetics advanced throughout the\n1980s, gene therapy gained an established foothold in theminds of medical scientists as a promising approach totreatments for specific diseases. One of the major reasonsfor the growth of gene therapy was scientists’ increasingability to identify the specific genetic malfunctions thatcaused inherited diseases. Interest grew as further studiesof DNA and chromosomes (where genes reside) showedthat specific genetic abnormalities in one or more genesoccurred in successive generations of certain familymembers who suffered from diseases like intestinal can-cer, manic-depression, Alzheimer’s disease , heart dis-\nease, diabetes, and many more. Although the genes maynot be the only cause of the disease in all cases, they maymake certain individuals more susceptible to developingthe disease because of environmental influences, likesmoking , pollution, and stress . In fact, some scientists\ntheorize that all diseases may have a genetic component.\nOn September 14, 1990, a four-year old girl suffering\nfrom a genetic disorder that prevented her body from pro-ducing a crucial enzyme became the first person to under-go gene therapy in the United States. Because her bodycould not produce adenosine deaminase (ADA), she had aweakened immune system, making her extremely suscep-tible to severe, life-threatening infections. W. FrenchAnderson and colleagues at the National Institutes ofHealth’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, tookwhite blood cells (which are crucial to proper immunesystem functioning) from the girl, inserted ADA produc-ing genes into them, and then transfused the cells backinto the patient. Although the young girl continued toshow an increased ability to produce ADA, debate aroseas to whether the improvement resulted from the genetherapy or from an additional drug treatment she received.\nNevertheless, a new era of gene therapy began as\nmore and more scientists sought to conduct clinical trial(testing in humans) research in this area. In that same\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1420Gene therapyyear, gene therapy was tested on patients suffering from\nmelanoma (skin cancer). The goal was to help them pro-duce antibodies (disease fighting substances in theimmune system) to battle the cancer.\nThese experiments have spawned an ever growing\nnumber of attempts at gene therapies designed to per-form a variety of functions in the body. For example, agene therapy for cystic fibrosis aims to supply a gene thatalters cells, enabling them to produce a specific proteinto battle the disease. Another approach was used forbrain cancer patients, in which the inserted gene wasdesigned to make the cancer cells more likely to respondto drug treatment. Another gene therapy approach forpatients suffering from artery blockage, which can leadto strokes, induces the growth of new blood vessels nearclogged arteries, thus ensuring normal blood circulation.\nCurrently, there are a host of new gene therapy\nagents in clinical trials. In the United States, both nucleicacid based ( in vivo ) treatments and cell-based ( ex vivo )\ntreatments are being investigated. Nucleic acid basedgene therapy uses vectors (like viruses) to deliver modi-fied genes to target cells. Cell-based gene therapy tech-niques remove cells from the patient in order to genetical-ly alter them then reintroduce them to the patient’s body.Presently, gene therapies for the following diseases arebeing developed: cystic fibrosis (using adenoviral vector),HIV infection (cell-based), malignant melanoma (cell-\nbased), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (cell-based),\nhemophilia B (cell-based), kidney cancer (cell-based),\nGaucher’s Disease (retroviral vector), breast cancer\n(retroviral vector), and lung cancer (retroviral vector).When a cell or individual is treated using gene therapyand successful incorporation of engineered genes hasoccurred, the cell or individual is said to be transgenic .\nThe medical establishment’s contribution to trans-\ngenic research has been supported by increased govern-ment funding. In 1991, the U.S. government provided$58 million for gene therapy research, with increases infunding of $15-40 million dollars a year over the follow-ing four years. With fierce competition over the promiseof societal benefit in addition to huge profits, large phar-maceutical corporations have moved to the forefront oftransgenic research. In an effort to be first in developingnew therapies, and armed with billions of dollars ofresearch funds, such corporations are making impressivestrides toward making gene therapy a viable reality in thetreatment of once elusive diseases.\nDiseases targeted for treatment by \ngene therapy\nThe potential scope of gene therapy is enormous.\nMore than 4,200 diseases have been identified as result-ing directly from abnormal genes, and countless others\nthat may be partially influenced by a person’s geneticmakeup. Initial research has concentrated on developinggene therapies for diseases whose genetic origins havebeen established and for other diseases that can be curedor ameliorated by substances genes produce.\nThe following are examples of potential gene thera-\npies. People suffering from cystic fibrosis lack a geneneeded to produce a salt-regulating protein. This proteinregulates the flow of chloride into epithelial cells, (thecells that line the inner and outer skin layers) whichcover the air passages of the nose and lungs. Without thisregulation, patients with cystic fibrosis build up a thickmucus that makes them prone to lung infections. A genetherapy technique to correct this abnormality mightemploy an adenovirus to transfer a normal copy of whatscientists call the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduc-tance regulator, or CTRF, gene. The gene is introducedinto the patient by spraying it into the nose or lungs.\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is also an inher-\nited disease, resulting in the inability to process choles-terol properly, which leads to high levels of artery-clog-ging fat in the blood stream. Patients with FH often sufferheart attacks and strokes because of blocked arteries. Agene therapy approach used to battle FH is much moreintricate than most gene therapies because it involves par-tial surgical removal of patients’ livers ( ex vivo transgene\ntherapy). Corrected copies of a gene that serve to reducecholesterol build-up are inserted into the liver sections,which are then transplanted back into the patients.\nGene therapy has also been tested on patients with\nAIDS . AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV), which weakens the body’s immune systemto the point that sufferers are unable to fight off diseases\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1421Gene therapy\nEarly detection of cancer.The researcher’s pen marks a\nband on a DNA sequencing autoradiogram confirming abladder cancer. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\npermission.)like pneumonias and cancer. In one approach, genes that\nproduce specific HIV proteins have been altered to stim-ulate immune system functioning without causing thenegative effects that a complete HIV molecule has on theimmune system. These genes are then injected in thepatient’s blood stream. Another approach to treatingAIDS is to insert, via white blood cells, genes that havebeen genetically engineered to produce a receptor thatwould attract HIV and reduce its chances of replicating.\nSeveral cancers also have the potential to be treated\nwith gene therapy. A therapy tested for melanoma, orskin cancer, involves introducing a gene with an anti-cancer protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) intotest tube samples of the patient’s own cancer cells, whichare then reintroduced into the patient. In brain cancer, theapproach is to insert a specific gene that increases thecancer cells’ susceptibility to a common drug used infighting the disease.\nGaucher disease is an inherited disease caused by a\nmutant gene that inhibits the production of an enzymecalled glucocerebrosidase. Patients with Gaucher diseasehave enlarged livers and spleens and eventually theirbones deteriorate. Clinical gene therapy trials focus oninserting the gene for producing this enzyme.\nGene therapy is also being considered as an\napproach to solving a problem associated with a surgicalprocedure known as balloon angioplasty . In this proce-\ndure, a stent (in this case, a type of tubular scaffolding) isused to open the clogged artery. However, in response tothe trauma of the stent insertion, the body initiates a nat-ural healing process that produces too many cells in theartery and results in restenosis, or reclosing of the artery.The gene therapy approach to preventing this unwantedside effect is to cover the outside of the stents with a sol-uble gel. This gel contains vectors for genes that reducethis overactive healing response.\nThe Human Genome Project\nAlthough great strides have been made in gene thera-\npy in a relatively short time, its potential usefulness hasbeen limited by lack of scientific data concerning the mul-titude of functions that genes control in the human body.For instance, it is now known that the vast majority ofgenetic material does not store information for the creationof proteins, but rather is involved in the control and regula-tion of gene expression, and is, thus, much more difficultto interpret. Even so, each individual cell in the body car-ries thousands of genes coding for proteins, with someestimates as high as 150,000 genes. For gene therapy toadvance to its full potential, scientists must discover thebiological role of each of these individual genes and wherethe base pairs that make them up are located on DNA.To address this issue, the National Institutes of\nHealth initiated the Human Genome Project in 1990. Ledby James D. Watson (one of the co-discoverers of thechemical makeup of DNA) the project’s 15-year goal isto map the entire human genome (a combination of thewords gene and chromosomes). A genome map wouldclearly identify the location of all genes as well as themore than three billion base pairs that make them up.With a precise knowledge of gene locations and func-tions, scientists may one day be able to conquer or con-trol diseases that have plagued humanity for centuries.\nScientists participating in the Human Genome Project\nhave identified an average of one new gene a day, butmany expect this rate of discovery to increase. By the year2005, their goal is to determine the exact location of all thegenes on human DNA and the exact sequence of the basepairs that make them up. Some of the genes identifiedthrough this project include a gene that predisposes peopleto obesity , one associated with programmed cell death\n(apoptosis), a gene that guides HIV viral reproduction, andthe genes of inherited disorders like Huntington’s disease,Lou Gehrig’s disease, and some colon and breast cancers.In February of 2001, scientists published a rought draft ofthe complete human genome. With fewer than the antici-pated number of genes found, between 30,000 –40,000,the consequences of this announcement are enormous.Scientists caution however, that the initial publication isonly a draft of the human genome and much more work isstill ahead for the completion of the project. As the humangenome is completed, there will be more informationavailable for gene therapy research and implementation.\nThe future of gene therapy\nGene therapy seems elegantly simple in its concept:\nsupply the human body with a gene that can correct a bio-logical malfunction that causes a disease. However, thereare many obstacles and some distinct questions concern-ing the viability of gene therapy. For example, viral vec-tors must be carefully controlled lest they infect thepatient with a viral disease. Some vectors, like retrovirus-es, can also enter cells functioning properly and interferewith the natural biological processes, possibly leading toother diseases. Other viral vectors, like the adenoviruses,are often recognized and destroyed by the immune systemso their therapeutic effects are short-lived. Maintaininggene expression so it performs its role properly after vec-tor delivery is difficult. As a result, some therapies need tobe repeated often to provide long-lasting benefits.\nOne of the most pressing issues, however, is gene\nregulation. Genes work in concert to regulate their func-tioning. In other words, several genes may play a part inturning other genes on and off. For example, certain\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1422Gene therapygenes work together to stimulate cell division and\ngrowth, but if these are not regulated, the inserted genescould cause tumor formation and cancer. Another diffi-culty is learning how to make the gene go into actiononly when needed. For the best and safest therapeuticeffort, a specific gene should turn on, for example, whencertain levels of a protein or enzyme are low and must bereplaced. But the gene should also remain dormant whennot needed to ensure it doesn’t oversupply a substanceand disturb the body’s delicate chemical makeup.\nOne approach to gene regulation is to attach other\ngenes that detect certain biological activities and thenKEY TERMS\nCell—The smallest living units of the body which\ngroup together to form tissues and help the bodyperform specific functions.\nChromosome —A microscopic thread-like structure\nfound within each cell of the body and consists of acomplex of proteins and DNA.

Although still in the rudimentary stages,researchers are making headway in inhibiting some genefunctioning by using a synthetic DNA to block gene tran-scriptions (the copying of genetic information). Thisapproach may have implications for gene therapy.\nThe ethics of gene therapy\nWhile gene therapy holds promise as a revolutionary\napproach to treating disease, ethical concerns over its useand ramifications have been expressed by scientists and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1423Gene therapylay people alike. For example, since much needs to be\nlearned about how these genes actually work and theirlong-term effect, is it ethical to test these therapies onhumans, where they could have a disastrous result? Aswith most clinical trials concerning new therapies,including many drugs, the patients participating in thesestudies have usually not responded to more establishedtherapies and are often so ill the novel therapy is theironly hope for long-term survival.\nAnother questionable outgrowth of gene therapy is\nthat scientists could possibly manipulate genes to geneti-cally control traits in human offspring that are not healthrelated. For example, perhaps a gene could be inserted toensure that a child would not be bald, a seemingly harm-less goal. However, what if genetic manipulation wasused to alter skin color, prevent homosexuality, or ensuregood looks? If a gene is found that can enhance intelli-gence of children who are not yet born, will everyone insociety, the rich and the poor, have access to the technol-ogy or will it be so expensive only the elite can afford it?\nThe Human Genome Project, which plays such an\nintegral role for the future of gene therapy, also has socialrepercussions. If individual genetic codes can be deter-mined, will such information be used against people? Forexample, will someone more susceptible to a diseasehave to pay higher insurance premiums or be deniedhealth insurance altogether? Will employers discriminatebetween two potential employees, one with a “healthy”genome and the other with genetic abnormalities?\nSome of these concerns can be traced back to the\neugenics movement popular in the first half of the twenti-eth century. This genetic “philosophy” was a societalmovement that encouraged people with “positive” traitsto reproduce while those with less desirable traits weresanctioned from having children. Eugenics was used topass strict immigration laws in the United States, barringless suitable people from entering the country lest theyreduce the quality of the country’s collective gene pool.Probably the most notorious example of eugenics inaction was the rise of Nazism in Germany, which result-ed in the Eugenic Sterilization Law of 1933. The lawrequired sterilization for those suffering from certain dis-abilities and even for some who were simply deemed“ugly.” To ensure that this novel science is not abused,many governments have established organizationsspecifically for overseeing the development of gene ther-apy. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administra-tion and the National Institutes of Health requires scien-tists to take a precise series of steps and meet stringentrequirements before approving clinical trials.\nIn fact, gene therapy has been immersed in more\ncontroversy and surrounded by more scrutiny in both thehealth and ethical arena than most other technologies\n(except, perhaps, for cloning) that promise to substantial-ly change society. Despite the health and ethical ques-tions surrounding gene therapy, the field will continue togrow and is likely to change medicine faster than anyprevious medical advancement.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHyde, Margaret O., and Lawrence E.

    "title": "General adaptation syndrome",
    "content": "General adaptation syndrome\nDefinition\nGeneral adaptation syndrome describes the body’s\nshort-term and long-term reaction to stress .\nDescription\nOriginally described by Hans De Solye in the 1920s,\nthe general adaptation syndrome describes a three stage\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1424General adaptation syndromereaction to stress. Stressors in humans include physical\nstressors, such as starvation , being hit by a car, or suffer-\ning through severe weather. Additionally, humans cansuffer emotional or mental stress, such as the loss of aloved one, the inability to solve a problem, or even hav-ing a difficult day at work.\nStage 1: Alarm reaction\nThe first stage of the general adaptation stage, the\nalarm reaction, is the immediate reaction to a stressor. Inthe initial phase of stress, humans exhibit a “fight orflight” response, which causes one to be ready for physi-cal activity. However, this initial response can alsodecrease the effectiveness of the immune system, makingpersons more susceptible to illness during this phase.\nStage 2: Stage of resistance\nStage 2 might also be named the stage of adaptation,\ninstead of the stage of resistance. During this phase, ifthe stress continues, the body adapts to the stressors it isexposed to. Changes at many levels take place in order toreduce the effect of the stressor. For example, if the stres-sor is starvation (possibly due to anorexia), the personmight experienced a reduced desire for physical activityto conserve energy, and the absorption of nutrients fromfood might be maximized.\nStage 3: Stage of exhaustion\nAt this stage, the stress has continued for some time.\nThe body’s resistance to the stress may gradually bereduced, or may collapse quickly. Generally, this meansthe immune system, and the body’s ability to resist dis-ease, may be almost totally eliminated. Patients whoexperience long-term stress may succumb to heartattacks or severe infection due to their reduced immunity.For example, a person with a stressful job may experi-ence long-term stress that might lead to high blood pres-sure and an eventual heart attack .\nStress, a useful reaction?\nAlthough stress can lead to disease, a researcher named\nHuethner has suggested that long-term stress may causehumans to better adapt to their environment. He argues thatsevere, long-term stress can cause persons to reject long-held assumptions or behaviors, and that stress can actuallyhelp the brain make physical changes that reflect these men-tal or emotional changes. In short, stress might allow per-sons to change the way they think and act for the better.\nCauses and symptoms\nStress is the cause of general adaptation syndrome\nand it can manifest as fatigue , irritability, difficulty con-KEY TERMS\nStressor —Any external stimuli that causes stress,\nranging from starvation to test-taking.\ncentrating, and difficulty sleeping. Persons may also\nexperience other symptoms that are signs of stress. Per-sons experiencing unusual symptoms, such as hair loss,without another medical explanation might considerstress as the cause.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is difficult. Some physiological changes,\nsuch as increased cortisol levels, are characteristic oflong-term stress.\nTreatment\nTreatment should involve stress reduction . Stress\nmay be thought of as occurring in two steps. The firststep is the occurrence of the external stressor, the secondis the reaction to the external stressor. Stress reductionstrategies generally fall into three categories: avoidingstressors, changing the reaction to the stressor(s), orrelieving stress after the reaction to the stressor(s). Manystrategies for stress reduction, such as exercising, listen-ing to music, aromatherapy , and massage relieve stress\nafter it occurs. Many psychotherapeutic approachesattempt to reduce the response of the patient to stressors.Persons wishing to reduce stress should consult a med-ical professional with whom they feel comfortable to dis-cuss which option, or combination of options, they canuse to reduce stress.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nHuethner, G. “The central adaptation syndrome: Psychosocial\nstress as a trigger for adaptive modifications of brainstructure and brain function.” Progress in Neurobiology\n48 (1996): 569-612.\nOTHER\n“Stress management, General adaptation syndrome, GAS.”\n<http://www.holisticonline.com/stress/stress_GAS.htm>.\nMichael Zuck, PhD\nGeneral anesthetic seeAnesthesia, \ngeneral\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1425General adaptation syndromeGeneral surgery\nDefinition\nGeneral surgery is the treatment of injury, deformity,\nand disease using operative procedures.\nPurpose\nGeneral surgery is frequently performed to alleviate\nsuffering when a cure is unlikely through medicationalone. It can be used for routine procedures performed ina physician’s office, such as vasectomy , or for more\ncomplicated operations requiring a medical team in ahospital setting, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy\n(removal of the gallbladder). Areas of the body treated bygeneral surgery include the stomach, liver, intestines,appendix, breasts, thyroid gland, salivary glands, somearteries and veins, and the skin. The brain, heart, eyes,and feet, to name only a few, are areas that require spe-cialized surgical repair.\nNew methods and techniques are less invasive than\nprevious practices, permitting procedures that were con-sidered impossible in the past. For example, micro-surgery has been used in reattaching severed body partsby successfully reconnecting small blood vessels andnerves.\nPrecautions\nPatients who are obese, smoke, have bleeding ten-\ndencies, or are over 60, need to follow special precau-tions, as do patients who have recently experienced anillness such as pneumonia or a heart attack . Patients on\nmedications such as heart and blood pressure medicine,blood thinners, muscle relaxants , tranquilizers, insulin,\nor sedatives, may require special lab tests prior to surgeryand special monitoring during surgery. Special precau-tions may be necessary for patients using mind-alteringdrugs such as narcotics, psychedelics, hallucinogens,marijuana, sedatives, or cocaine since these drugs may\ninteract with the anesthetic agents used during surgery.\nDescription\nIn earlier times, surgery was a dangerous and dirty\npractice. Until the middle of the 19th century, as manypatients died of surgery as were cured. With the discov-ery and development of general anesthesia in the mid-1800s, surgery became more humane. And as knowledgeabout infections grew, surgery became more successfulas sterile practices were introduced into the operatingroom. The last 50 years of the 20th century have seencontinued advancements.Types of General Surgery\nGeneral surgery experienced major advances with the\nintroduction of the endoscope. This is an instrument forvisualizing the interior of a body canal or a hollow organ.Endoscopic surgery relies on this pencil-thin instrument,capable of its own lighting system and small video cam-era. The endoscope is inserted through tiny incisionscalled portals. While viewing the procedure on a videoscreen, the surgeon then operates with various other small,precise instruments inserted through one or more of theportals. The specific area of the body treated determinesthe type of endoscopic surgery performed. For example,colonoscopy uses an endoscope, which can be equipped\nwith a device for obtaining tissue samples for visual exam-ination of the colon. Gastroscopy uses an endoscopeinserted through the mouth to examine the interior of thestomach. Arthroscopy refers to joint surgery, and abdomi-\nnal procedures are called laparoscopies.\nEndoscopy is used in both treatment and diagnosis\nespecially involving the digestive and female reproduc-tive systems. Endoscopy has advantages over many othersurgical procedures, resulting in a quicker recovery andshorter hospital stay. This non-invasive technique isbeing used for appendectomies, gallbladder surgery, hys-terectomies and the repair of shoulder and knee liga-ments. However, endoscopy does not come without limi-tations such as complications and high operatingexpense. Also, endoscopy doesn’t offer advantages overconventional surgery in all procedures. Some literaturestates that as general surgeons become more experiencedin their prospective fields, additional non-invasivesurgery will be a more common option to patients.\nONE-DAY SURGERY. One-day surgery is also termed\nsame-day, or outpatient surgery. Surgical procedures usu-ally take two hours or less and involve minimal bloodloss and a short recovery time. In the majority of surgicalcases, oral medications control postoperative pain .\nCataract removal, laparoscopy , tonsillectomy, repair of\nbroken bones, hernia repair , and a wide range of cos-\nmetic procedures are common same-day surgical proce-dures. Many individuals prefer the convenience andatmosphere of one-day surgery centers, as there is lesscompetition for attention with more serious surgicalcases. These centers are accredited by the Joint Commis-sion on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or theAccreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care.\nPreparation\nThe preparation of patients has advanced signifi-\ncantly with improved diagnostic techniques and proce-dures. Before surgery the patient may be asked to under-go a series of tests including blood and urine studies, x\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1426General surgeryrays and specific heart studies if the patient’s past med-\nical history and/or physical exam warrants this testing.Before any general surgery the physician will explain thenature of the surgery needed, the reason for the proce-dure, and the anticipated outcome. The risks involvedwill be discussed along with the types of anesthesia uti-lized. The expected length of recovery and limitationsimposed during the recovery period are also explained indetail before any general surgical procedure.\nSurgical procedures most often require some type of\nanesthetic. Some procedures require only local anesthe-sia, produced by injecting the anesthetic agent into theskin near the site of the operation. The patient remainsawake with this form of medication. Injecting anestheticagents into a primary nerve located near the surgical siteproduces block anesthesia (also known as regional anes-thesia), which is a more extensive local anesthesia. Thepatient remains conscious, but is usually sedated. Gener-al anesthesia involves injecting anesthetic agents into theblood stream and/or inhaling medicines through a maskplaced over the patient’s face. During general anesthesia,the patient is asleep and an airway tube is usually placedinto the windpipe to help keep the airway open.\nAs part of the preoperative preparation, the patient\nwill receive printed educational material and may beasked to review audio or videotapes. The patient will beinstructed to shower or bathe the evening before or morn-ing of surgery and may be asked to scrub the operativesite with a special antibacterial soap. Instructions will alsobe given to the patient to ingest nothing by mouth for adetermined period of time prior to the surgical procedure.\nAftercare\nAfter surgery, blood studies and a laboratory exami-\nnation of removed fluid or tissue are often performedespecially in the case of cancer surgery. After the opera-\ntion, the patient is brought to a recovery room and vitalsigns, fluid status, dressings and surgical drains are mon-itored. Pain medications are offered and used as neces-sary. Breathing exercises are encouraged to maximizerespiratory function and leg exercises are encouraged topromote adequate circulation and prevent pooling ofblood in the lower extremities. Patients must have aresponsible adult accompany them home if leaving thesame day as the surgery was performed.\nRisks\nOne of the risks involved with general surgery is the\npotential for postoperative complications. These compli-cations include—but are not limited to—pneumonia,internal bleeding, and wound infection as well as adversereactions to anesthesia.KEY TERMS\nAppendectomy —Removal of the appendix.\nEndoscope —Instrument for examining visually the\ninside of a body canal or a hollow organ such asthe stomach, colon, or bladder.\nHysterectomy —Surgical removal of part or all of\nthe uterus.\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy —Removal of the\ngallbladder using a laparoscope, a fiberopticalinstrument inserted through the abdomen.\nMicrosurgery —Surgery on small body structures\nor cells performed with the aid of a microscopeand other specialized instruments.\nPortal —An entrance or a means of entrance.\nNormal results\nAdvances in diagnostic and surgical techniques have\nincreased the success rate of general surgery by manytimes compared to the past. Today’s less invasive surgicalprocedures have reduced the length of hospital stays,shortened recovery time, decreased postoperative painand decreased the size of surgical incision. On the aver-age, a conventional abdominal surgery requires a three tosix-day hospital stay and three to six-week recovery time.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal results from general surgery include per-\nsistent pain, swelling, redness, drainage or bleeding inthe surgical area and surgical wound infection resultingin slow healing.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDawson, Dawn P., ed., et al.

Larson, RPT\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1427General surgeryGeneralized anxiety disorder\nDefinition\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is a condition charac-\nterized by “free floating” anxiety or apprehension notlinked to a specific cause or situation.\nDescription\nSome degree of fear and anxiety is perfectly normal.\nIn the face of real danger, fear makes people more alertand also prepares the body to fight or flee (the so-called“fight or flight” response). When people are afraid, theirhearts beat faster and they breathe faster in anticipationof the physical activity that will be required of them.However, sometimes people can become anxious evenwhen there is no identifiable cause, and this anxiety canbecome overwhelming and very unpleasant, interferingwith their daily lives. People with debilitating anxiety aresaid to be suffering from anxiety disorders , such as\nphobias , panic disorders, and generalized anxiety disor-\nder. The person with generalized anxiety disorder gener-ally has chronic (officially, having more days with anxi-ety than not for at least six months), recurrent episodes ofanxiety that can last days, weeks, or even months.\nCauses and symptoms\nGeneralized anxiety disorder afflicts between 2–3%\nof the general population, and is slightly more commonin women than in men. It accounts for almost one-thirdof cases referred to psychiatrists by general practitioners.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder may result from a\ncombination of causes. Some people are genetically pre-disposed to developing it. Psychological traumas thatoccur during childhood, such as prolonged separationfrom parents, may make people more vulnerable as well.Stressful life events, such as a move, a major job change,the loss of a loved one, or a divorce, can trigger or con-tribute to the anxiety.\nPsychologically, the person with generalized anxiety\ndisorder may develop a sense of dread for no apparentreason—the irrational feeling that some nameless cata-strophe is about to happen. Physical symptoms similar tothose found with panic disorder may be present,\nalthough not as severe. They may include trembling,sweating, heart palpitations (the feeling of the heart\npounding in the chest), nausea, and “butterflies in thestomach.”\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, 4th edition, a person must have at\nleast three of the following symptoms, with some beingpresent more days than not for at least six months, inorder to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder:\n• restlessness or feeling on edge\n• being easily fatigued\n• difficulty concentrating• irritability\n• muscle tension\n• sleep disturbance\nWhile generalized anxiety disorder is not complete-\nly debilitating, it can compromise a person’s effective-ness and quality of life.\nDiagnosis\nAnyone with chronic anxiety for no apparent reason\nshould see a physician. The physician may diagnose thecondition based on the patient’s description of the physi-cal and emotional symptoms. The doctor will also try torule out other medical conditions that may be causing thesymptoms, such as excessive caffeine use, thyroid dis-\nease, hypoglycemia , cardiac problems, or drug or alcohol\nwithdrawal. Psychological conditions, such as depressivedisorder with anxiety, will also need to be ruled out.\nSince generalized anxiety disorder often co-occurs\nwith mood disorders and substance abuse, the clinician\nmay have to treat these conditions as well, and thereforemust consider them in making the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nOver the short term, a group of tranquilizers called\nbenzodiazepines , such as clonazepam (Klonipin) may\nhelp ease the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.Sometimes antidepressant drugs , such as amitryptiline\n(Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n(SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) or sertraline (Zoloft),are also used.\nPsychotherapy can be effective in treating general-\nized anxiety disorder. The therapy may take many forms.In some cases, psychodynamically-oriented psychothera-py can help patients work through this anxiety and solveproblems in their lives. Cognitive behavioral therapy aimsto reshape the way people perceive and react to potentialstressors in their lives. Relaxation techniques have alsobeen used in treatment, as well as in prevention efforts.\nPrognosis\nWhen properly treated, most patients with general-\nized anxiety disorder experience improvement in theirsymptoms.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1428Generalized anxiety disorderPrevention\nWhile preventive measures have not been estab-\nlished, a number of techniques may help manage anxiety,such as relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, anddistraction—putting the anxiety out of one’s mind byfocusing thoughts on something else.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 4th ed.\nWashington, DC: American Psychiatric Association,1994.\nHallowell, Edward M.

    "title": "Genetic counseling",
    "content": "Genetic counseling\nDefinition\nGenetic counseling aims to facilitate the exchange of\ninformation regarding a person’s genetic legacy. Itattempts to:\n• accurately diagnose a disorder• assess the risk of recurrence in the concerned family\nmembers and their relatives\n• provide alternatives for decision-makingKEY TERMS\nCognitive behavioral therapy —A psychotherapeu-\ntic approach that aims at altering cognitions—including thoughts, beliefs, and images—as a wayof altering behavior.• provide support groups that will help family members\ncope with the recurrence of a disorder\nPurpose\nGenetic counselors work with people concerned\nabout the risk of an inherited disease. The counselor doesnot prevent the incidence of a disease in a family, but canhelp family members assess the risk for certain heredi-tary diseases and offer guidance. Many couples seekgenetic counseling because there is a family history ofknown genetic disorders, infertility ,miscarriage , still\nbirths, or early infant mortality. Other reasons for partici-pating in genetic counseling may be the influences of ajob or lifestyle that exposes a potential parent to healthrisks such as radiation, chemicals, or drugs. Any familyhistory of mental retardation can be of concern as is a\nstrong family history of heart disease at an early age.Recent statistics show a 3% chance of delivering a babywith birth defects . An additional 2% chance of having a\nbaby with Down syndrome is present for women in their\nlate thirties and older.\nPrecautions\nAmniocentesis , one of the specific tests used to\ngather information for genetic counseling, is best per-formed between weeks 15 and 17 of a pregnancy and an\nadditional one to four weeks may be required to cultureskin cells and analyze them. Thus, these test data are notavailable to assist prospective parents in decision-makinguntil the second trimester of the pregnancy. Individualswho participate in genetic counseling and associated test-ing also must be aware that there are no cures or treat-ments for some of the disorders that may be identified.\nDescription\nWith approximately 2,000 genes identified and\napproximately 5,000 disorders caused by genetic defects,genetic counseling is important in the medical disciplineof obstetrics. Genetic counselors, educated in the med-ical and the psychosocial aspects of genetic diseases,convey complex information to help people make lifedecisions. There are limitations to the power of geneticcounseling, though, since many of the diseases that havebeen shown to have a genetic basis currently offer nocure (for example, Down syndrome or Huntington’s dis-ease). Although a genetic counselor cannot predict thefuture unequivocally, he or she can discuss the occur-rence of a disease in terms of probability.\nA genetic counselor, with the aid of the patient or\nfamily, creates a detailed family pedigree that includesthe incidence of disease in first-degree (parents, siblings,and children) and second-degree (aunts, uncles, and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1429Genetic counselinggrandparents) relatives. Before or after this pedigree is\ncompleted, certain genetic tests are performed usingDNA analysis, x ray, ultrasound, urine analysis, skin\nbiopsy , and physical evaluation. For a pregnant woman,\nprenatal diagnosis can be made using amniocentesis orchorionic villus sampling .\nFamily pedigree\nAn important aspect of the genetic counseling ses-\nsion is the compilation of a family pedigree or medicalhistory. To accurately assess the risk of inherited dis-eases, information on three generations, including healthstatus and/or cause of death , is usually needed. If the\nfamily history is complicated information from more dis-tant relatives may be helpful, and medical records maybe requested for any family members who have had agenetic disorder. Through an examination of the familyhistory a counselor may be able to discuss the probabilityof future occurrence of genetic disorders. In all cases, thecounselor provides information in a non-directive waythat leaves the decision-making up to the client.\nScreening tests\nScreening blood tests help identify individuals who\ncarry genes for recessive genetic disorders. Screeningtests are usually only done if:\n• The disease is lethal or causes severe handicaps or dis-\nabilitiesKEY TERMS\nSickle-cell anemia —A chronic, inherited blood\ndisorder characterized by crescent-shaped redblood cells. It occurs primarily in people ofAfrican descent, and produces symptoms includ-ing episodic pain in the joints, fever, leg ulcers,and jaundice.\nTay-Sachs disease —A hereditary disease affecting\nyoung children of eastern European Jewishdescent. This disease is caused by an enzyme defi-ciency leading to the accumulation of gangliosides(galactose-containing cerebrosides) found in thesurface membranes of nerve cells in the brain andnerve tissue. This deficiency results in mental retar-dation, convulsions, blindness, and, finally, death.\nThalassemia —An inherited group of anemias\noccurring primarily among people of Mediter-ranean descent. It is caused by defective formationof part of the hemoglobin molecule.• The person is likely to be a carrier due to family pedi-\ngree or membership in an at-risk ethnic, geographic orracial group\n• The disorder can be treated or reproductive options\nexist\n• A reliable test is available.\nGenetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease , sick-\nle-cell anemia, and thalassemia meet these criteria, and\nscreening tests are commonly done to identify carriers ofthese diseases. In addition, screening tests may be donefor individuals with family histories of Huntington’s dis-ease (a degenerative neurological disease) or hemophilia\n(a bleeding disorder). Such screening tests can eliminatethe need for more invasive tests during a pregnancy.\nAnother screening test commonly used in the United\nStates in the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test. This test isdone on a sample of maternal blood around week 16 of apregnancy. An elevation in the serum AFP level indicatesthat the fetus may have certain birth defects such as neur-al tube defects (including spina bifida and anencephaly).\nIf the test yields an elevated result, it may be run againafter seven days. If the level is still elevated after repeattesting, additional diagnostic tests (e.g. ultrasound and/oramniocentesis) are done in an attempt to identify the spe-cific birth defect present.\nUltrasound\nUltrasound is a noninvasive procedure which uses\nsound waves to produce a reflected image of the fetusupon a screen. It is used to determine the age and posi-tion of the fetus, and the location of the placenta. Ultra-sound is also useful in detecting visible birth defects suchas spina bifida (a defect in the development of the verte-brae of the spinal column and/or the spinal cord). It isalso useful for detecting heart defects, and malforma-tions of the head, face, body, and limbs. This procedure,however, cannot detect biochemical or chromosomalalterations in the fetus.\nAmniocentesis\nAmniocentesis is useful in determining genetic and\ndevelopmental disorders not detectable by ultrasound.This procedure involves the insertion of a needle throughthe abdomen and into the uterus of a pregnant woman. Asample of amniotic fluid is withdrawn containing skincells that have been shed by the fetus. The sample is sentto a laboratory where fetal cells contained in the fluid areisolated and grown in order to provide enough geneticmaterial for testing. This takes about seven to 14 days.The material is then extracted and treated so that visualexamination for defects can be made. For some disor-ders, like Tay-Sachs disease, the simple presence of a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1430Genetic counselingtelltale chemical compound in the amniotic fluid is\nenough to confirm a diagnosis.\nChorionic villus sampling\nChorionic villus sampling involves the removal of a\nsmall amount of tissue directly from the chorionic villi(minute vascular projections of the fetal chorion thatcombine with maternal uterine tissue to form the placen-ta). In the laboratory, the chromosomes of the fetal cellsare analyzed for number and type. Extra chromosomes,such as are present in Down syndrome, can be identified.Additional laboratory tests can be performed to look forspecific disorders and the results are usually availablewithin a week after the sample is taken. The primary ben-efit of this procedure is that it is usually performedbetween weeks 10 and 12 of a pregnancy, allowing earli-er detection of fetal disorders.\nPreparation\nGenetic diagnosis requires that a couple share infor-\nmation about inherited disorders in their backgroundwith the genetic counselor, including details of anygenetic diseases in either family. A couple undergoinggenetic counseling also reports any past miscarriages anddiscusses the possibility of exposure to chemicals, radia-tion (including x rays), or other occupational environ-mental hazards. The couple also needs to disclose infor-mation about personal habits before or during pregnancysuch as drug or alcohol abuse and the use of prescriptionor over-the-counter drugs taken by the mother since thebeginning of pregnancy. The genetic counselor explainsthe procedures used in any testing that will be done anddescribes what each test can and cannot reveal.\nAftercare\nGenetic counseling provides couples with information\nthat can help them make decisions about future pregnan-cies. It also gives couples additional time to emotionallyprepare if a disorder is detected in the fetus. The counselordiscusses the results of any testing and informs the coupleif a problem is apparent. The doctor or genetic counseloralso discusses the treatment options available. Geneticcounseling is done in a non-directive way, so that any treat-ment selected remains the personal choice of the individu-als involved. Genetic counseling can provide informationessential for family planning and pregnancy management,thus maximizing the chances of a positive outcome.\nRisks\nBecause prenatal testing, such as amniocentesis and\nchorionic villus sampling, is invasive and carries a 1%risk of miscarriage it should never be considered routine.Normal results\nScreening tests and/or prenatal tests reveal no birth\ndefects or genetic abnormalities.\nAbnormal results\nA birth defect or genetic disorder is detected. The\nearly diagnosis of birth defects and genetic disordersallows a greater number of treatment options. Some dis-orders can be treated in utero (before birth while the fetusis still in the uterus), while others may require earlydelivery, immediate surgery, or cesarean section to min-\nimize fetal trauma. Prior warning of fetal difficultiesallows parents time to prepare emotionally for the birthof the child. In some instances, termination of the preg-nancy may be chosen. Whatever the test results, thisinformation is essential for family planning and pregnan-cy management.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBanasik, Jacquelyn L. “Genetic and Developmental Disorders.”\nIn Perspectives on Pathophysiology by Lee-Ellen C.

    "content": "Genetic testing\nDefinition\nA genetic test examines the genetic information con-\ntained inside a person’s cells, called DNA, to determine\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1431Genetic testingif that person has or will develop a certain disease or\ncould pass a disease to his or her offspring. Genetic testsalso determine whether or not couples are at a higher riskthan the general population for having a child affectedwith a genetic disorder.\nPurpose\nSome families or ethnic groups have a higher inci-\ndence of a certain disease than does the population as awhole. For example, individuals from Eastern European,Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at higher risk for carryinggenes for rare conditions that occur much less frequentlyin populations from other parts of the world. Before hav-ing a child, a couple from such a family or ethnic groupmay want to know if their child would be at risk of hav-ing that disease. Genetic testing for this type of purposeis called genetic screening.\nDuring pregnancy , the baby’s cells can be studied\nfor certain genetic disorders or chromosomal problemssuch as Down syndrome . Chromosome testing is most\ncommonly offered when the mother is 35 years or olderat the time of delivery. When there is a family medicalhistory of a genetic disease or there are individuals in afamily affected with developmental and physicaldelays, genetic testing may also be offered during preg-nancy. Genetic testing during pregnancy is called pre-natal diagnosis.\nPrior to becoming pregnant, couples who are having\ndifficulty conceiving a child or who have suffered multi-ple miscarriages may be tested to see if a genetic causecan be identified.\nA genetic disease may be diagnosed at birth by\ndoing a physical evaluation of the baby and observingcharacteristics of the disorder. Genetic testing can help toconfirm the diagnosis made by the physical evaluation.In addition, genetic testing is used routinely on all new-borns to screen for certain genetic diseases which canaffect a newborn baby’s health shortly after birth.\nThere are several genetic diseases and conditions in\nwhich the symptoms do not occur until adulthood. Onesuch example is Huntington’s disease. This is a seriousdisorder affecting the way in which individuals walk,talk and function on a daily basis. Genetic testing may beable to determine if someone at risk for the disease willin fact develop the disease.\nSome genetic defects may make a person more sus-\nceptible to certain types of cancer . Testing for these\ndefects can help predict a person’s risk. Other types ofgenetic tests help diagnose and predict and monitor thecourse of certain kinds of cancer, particularly leukemiaand lymphoma.Precautions\nBecause genetic testing is not always accurate and\nbecause there are many concerns surrounding insuranceand employment discrimination for the individual receiv-ing a genetic test, genetic counseling should always be\nperformed prior to genetic testing. A genetic counselor isan individual with a master’s degree in genetic counsel-ing. A medical geneticist is a physician specializing andboard certified in genetics.\nA genetic counselor reviews the person’s family his-\ntory and medical records and the reason for the test. Thecounselor explains the likelihood that the test will detectall possible causes of the disease in question (known asthe sensitivity of the test), and the likelihood that the dis-ease will develop if the test is positive (known as the pos-itive predictive value of the test).\nLearning about the disease in question, the benefits\nand risks of both a positive and a negative result, andwhat treatment choices are available if the result is posi-tive, will help prepare the person undergoing testing.During the genetic counseling session, the individualinterested in genetic testing will be asked to considerhow the test results will affect his or her life, family, andfuture decisions.\nAfter this discussion, the person should have the\nopportunity to indicate in writing that he or she gaveinformed consent to have the test performed, verifyingthat the counselor provided complete and understandableinformation.\nDescription\nGenes and chromosomes\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a long molecule\nmade up of two strands of genetic material coiled aroundeach other in a unique double helix structure. This struc-ture was discovered in 1953 by Francis Crick and JamesWatson.\nDNA is found in the nucleus, or center, of most cells\n(Some cells, such as a red blood cell, don’t have a nucle-us). Each person’s DNA is a unique blueprint, givinginstructions for a person’s physical traits, such as eyecolor, hair texture, height, and susceptibility to disease.DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes.\nThe instructions are contained in DNA’s long strands\nas a code spelled out by pairs of bases, which are fourchemicals that make up DNA. The bases occur as pairsbecause a base on one strand lines up with and is boundto a corresponding base on the other strand. The order ofthese bases form DNA’s code. The order of the bases on aDNA strand is important to ensuring that we are not\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1432Genetic testingaffected with any genetic diseases. When the bases are\nout of order, or missing, then often times, our cells do notproduce important proteins which can lead to a geneticdisorder. While our genes are found in every cell of ourbody, not every gene is functioning all of the time. Somegenes are turned on during critical points in developmentand then remain silent for the rest of our lives. Whileother genes remain active all of our lives so that our cellscan produce important proteins that help us digest foodproperly or fight off the common cold .\nThe specific order of the base pairs on a strand of\nDNA is important in order for the correct protein to beproduced. A grouping of three base pairs on the DNAstrand is called a codon. Each codon, or three base pairs,comes together to spell a word. A string of many codonstogether can be thought of as a series of words all comingtogether to make a sentence. This sentence is whatinstructs our cells to make a protein that helps our bodiesfunction properly.\nOur DNA strands containing a hundred to several\nthousand copies of genes are found on structurescalled chromosomes. Each cell typically has 46 chro-mosomes arranged into 23 pairs. Each parent con-tributes one chromosome to each pair. The first 22pairs are called autosomal chromosomes, or non-sexchromosomes and are assigned a number from 1–22.The last pair are the sex chromosomes and include theX and the Y chromosomes. If a child receives an Xchromosome from each parent, the child is female. If achild receives an X from the mother, and a Y from thefather, the child is male.\nJust as each parent contributes one chromosome to\neach pair, so each parent contributes one gene from eachchromosome. The pair of genes produces a specific traitin the child. In autosomal dominant conditions, it takesonly one copy of a gene to influence a specific trait. Thestronger gene is called dominant; the weaker gene, reces-sive. Two copies of a recessive gene are needed to con-trol a trait while only one copy of a dominant gene isneeded. Our sex chromosomes, the X and the Y also con-tain important genes. Some genetic diseases are causedby missing, or altered genes on one of the sex chromo-somes. Males are most often affected by sex chromo-some diseases when they inherit an X chromosome withmissing or mutated genes from their mother.\nTYPES OF GENETIC MUTATIONS. Genetic disease\nresults from a change, or mutation, in a chromosome orin one or several base pairs on a gene. Some of us inheritthese mutations from our parents, called hereditary orgermline mutations, while other mutations can occurspontaneously, or for the first time in an affected child.For many of the adult on-set diseases, genetic mutationscan occur over the lifetime of the individual. This is\ncalled acquired or somatic mutations and these occurwhile the cells are making copies of themselves or divid-ing in two. There may be some environmental effects,such as radiation or other chemicals, which can con-tribute to these types of mutations as well.\nThere are a variety of different types of mutations\nthat can occur in our genetic code to cause a disease. Andfor each genetic disease, there may be more than onetype of mutation to cause the disease. For some geneticdiseases, the same mutation occurs in every individualaffected with the disease. For example, the most commonform of dwarfism, called achondroplasia , occurs\nbecause of a single base pair substitution. This samemutation occurs in all individuals affected with the dis-ease. Other genetic diseases are caused by different typesof genetic mutations that may occur anywhere along thelength of a gene. For example, cystic fibrosis , the most\ncommon genetic disease in the caucasian population iscaused by over hundreds of different mutations along the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1433Genetic testing\nA scientist examines a DNA sequencing autoradiogram on a\nlight box. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)gene. Individual families may carry the same mutation as\neach other, but not as the rest of the population affectedwith the same genetic disease.\nSome genetic diseases occur as a result of a larger\nmutation which can occur when the chromosome itself iseither rearranged or altered or when a baby is born withmore than the expected number of chromosomes. Thereare only a few types of chromosome rearrangementswhich are possibly hereditary, or passed on from themother or the father. The majority of chromosome alter-ations where the baby is born with too many chromo-somes or missing a chromosome, occurs sporadically orfor the first time with a new baby.\nThe type of mutation that causes a genetic disease\nwill determine the type of genetic test to be performed.In some situations, more than one type of genetic testwill be performed to arrive at a diagnosis. The cost ofgenetic tests vary: chromosome studies can cost hun-dreds of dollars and certain gene studies, thousands.Insurance coverage also varies with the company and thepolicy. It may take several days or several weeks to com-plete a test. Research testing where the exact location ofa gene has not yet been identified, can take severalmonths to years for results.\nTypes of Genetic Testing\nDirect DNA mutation analysis\nDirect DNA sequencing examines the direct base\npair sequence of a gene for specific gene mutations.Some genes contain more than 100,000 bases and amutation of any one base can make the gene nonfunc-tional and cause disease. The more mutations possible,the less likely it is for a test to detect all of them. This testis usually done on white blood cells from a person’sblood but can also be performed on other tissues. Thereare different ways in which to perform direct DNA muta-tion analysis. When the specific genetic mutation isknown, it is possible to perform a complete analysis ofthe genetic code, also called direct sequencing. There areseveral different lab techniques used to test for a directmutation. One common approach begins by using chemi-cals to separate DNA from the rest of the cell. Next, thetwo strands of DNA are separated by heating. Specialenzymes (called restriction enzymes) are added to thesingle strands of DNA and then act like scissors and cutthe strands in specific places. The DNA fragments arethen sorted by size through a process called electrophore-sis. A special piece of DNA, called a probe, is added tothe fragments. The probe is designed to bind to specificmutated portions of the gene. When bound to the probe,the mutated portions appear on x-ray film with a distinctbanding pattern.Indirect DNA Testing\nFamily linkage studies are done to study a disease\nwhen the exact type and location of the genetic alter-ation is not known, but the general location on the chro-mosome has been identified. These studies are possiblewhen a chromosome marker has been found associatedwith a disease. Chromosomes contain certain regionsthat vary in appearance between individuals. Theseregions are called polymorphisms and do not cause agenetic disease to occur. If a polymorphism is alwayspresent in family members with the same genetic dis-ease, and absent in family members without the disease,it is likely that the gene responsible for the disease isnear that polymorphism. The gene mutation can be indi-rectly detected in family members by looking for thepolymorphism.\nTo look for the polymorphism, DNA is isolated from\ncells in the same way it is for direct DNA mutationanalysis. A probe is added that will detect the large poly-morphism on the chromosome. When bound to theprobe, this region will appear on x-ray film with a dis-tinct banding pattern. The pattern of banding of a personbeing tested for the disease is compared to the patternfrom a family member affected by the disease.\nLinkage studies have disadvantages not found in\ndirect DNA mutation analysis. These studies requiremultiple family members to participate in the testing. Ifkey family members choose not to participate, theincomplete family history may make testing other mem-bers useless. The indirect method of detecting a mutatedgene also causes more opportunity for error.\nChromosome analysis\nVarious genetic syndromes are caused by structural\nchromosome abnormalities. To analyze a person’s chro-mosomes, his or her cells are allowed to grow and multi-ply in the laboratory until they reach a certain stage ofgrowth. The length of growing time varies with the type ofcells. Cells from blood and bone marrow take one to twodays; fetal cells from amniotic fluid take seven to 10 days.\nWhen the cells are ready, they are placed on a micro-\nscope slide using a technique to make them burst open,spreading their chromosomes. The slides are stained: thestain creates a banding pattern unique to each chromo-some. Under a microscope, the chromosomes are count-ed, identified, and analyzed based on their size, shape,and stained appearance.\nA karyotype is the final step in the chromosome\nanalysis. After the chromosomes are counted, a photo-graph is taken of the chromosomes from one or morecells as seen through the microscope. Then the chromo-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1434Genetic testingsomes are cut out and arranged side-by-side with their\npartner in ascending numerical order, from largest tosmallest. The karyotype is done either manually or usinga computer attached to the microscope. Chromosomeanalysis is also called cytogenetics.\nApplications for Genetic Testing\nNewborn screening\nGenetic testing is used most often for newborn\nscreening. Every year, millions of newborn babies havetheir blood samples tested for potentially serious geneticdiseases.\nCarrier testing\nAn individual who has a gene associated with a dis-\nease but never exhibits any symptoms of the disease iscalled a carrier. A carrier is a person who is not affectedby the mutated gene he or she possesses, but can pass thegene to an offspring. Genetic tests have been developedthat tell prospective parents whether or not they are carri-KEY TERMS\nAutosomal disease —A disease caused by a gene\nlocated on an autosomal chromosome.\nCarrier —A person who possesses a gene for an\nabnormal trait without showing signs of the disor-der. The person may pass the abnormal gene on tooffspring.\nChromosome —A microscopic thread-like structure\nfound within each cell of the body and consists of acomplex of proteins and DNA. Humans have 46chromosomes arranged into 23 pairs. Changes ineither the total number of chromosomes or theirshape and size (structure) may lead to physical ormental abnormalities.\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) —The genetic materi-\nal in cells that holds the inherited instructions forgrowth, development, and cellular functioning.\nDominant gene —A gene, whose presence as a sin-\ngle copy, controls the expression of a trait.\nEnzyme —A protein that catalyzes a biochemical\nreaction or change without changing its own struc-ture or function.\nGene —A building block of inheritance, which con-\ntains the instructions for the production of a particu-lar protein, and is made up of a molecular sequencefound on a section of DNA. Each gene is found on a\nprecise location on a chromosome.\nKaryotype —A standard arrangement of photo-\ngraphic or computer-generated images of chromo-some pairs from a cell in ascending numericalorder, from largest to smallest.\nMutation —A permanent change in the genetic\nmaterial that may alter a trait or characteristic of anindividual, or manifest as disease, and can be trans-mitted to offspring.\nPositive predictive value (PPV) —The probability\nthat a person with a positive test result has, or willget, the disease.\nRecessive gene —A type of gene that is not\nexpressed as a trait unless inherited by both parents.\nSensitivity —The proportion of people with a dis-\nease who are correctly diagnosed (test positivebased on diagnostic criteria). The higher the sensi-tivity of a test or diagnostic criteria, the lower therate of ‘false negatives,’ people who have a diseasebut are not identified through the test.\nSex-linked disorder —A disorder caused by a gene\nlocated on a sex chromosome, usually the X chro-mosome.\ners of certain diseases. If one or both parents are a carrier,\nthe risk of passing the disease to a child can be predicted.\nTo predict the risk, it is necessary to know if the gene\nin question is autosomal or sex-linked. If the gene is carriedon any one of chromosomes 1–22, the resulting disease iscalled an autosomal disease. If the gene is carried on the Xor Y chromosome, it is called a sex-linked disease.\nSex-linked diseases, such as the bleeding condition\nhemophilia , are usually carried on the X chromosome. A\nwoman who carries a disease-associated mutated gene onone of her X chromosomes, has a 50% chance of passingthat gene to her son. A son who inherits that gene willdevelop the disease because he does not have anothernormal copy of the gene on a second X chromosome tocompensate for the mutated copy. A daughter who inher-its the disease associated mutated gene from her mother,on one of her X chromosomes will be at risk for having ason affected with the disease.\nThe risk of passing an autosomal disease to a child\ndepends on whether the gene is dominant or recessive. A\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1435Genetic testingprospective parent carrying a dominant gene, has a 50%\nchance of passing the gene to a child. A child needs toreceive only one copy of the mutated gene to be affectedby the disease.\nIf the gene is recessive, a child needs to receive two\ncopies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to beaffected by the disease. When both prospective parentsare carriers, their child has a 25% chance of inheritingtwo copies of the mutated gene and being affected by thedisease; a 50% chance of inheriting one copy of themutated gene, and being a carrier of the disease but notaffected; and a 25% chance of inheriting two normalgenes. When only one prospective parent is a carrier, achild has a 50% chance of inheriting one mutated geneand being an unaffected carrier of the disease, and a 50%chance of inheriting two normal genes.\nCystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the lungs and\npancreas and is discovered in early childhood. It is themost common autosomal recessive genetic disease foundin the caucasian population: one in 25 people of NorthernEuropean ancestry are carriers of a mutated cystic fibro-sis gene. The gene, located on chromosome 7, was iden-tified in 1989.\nThe gene mutation for cystic fibrosis is detected by a\ndirect DNA test. Over 600 mutations of the cystic fibro-sis gene have been found; each of these mutations causethe same disease. Tests are available for the most com-mon mutations. Tests that check for the 86 of the mostcommon mutations in the Caucasian population willdetect 90% of carriers for cystic fibrosis. (The percentageof mutations detected varies according to the individual’sethnic background). If a person tests negative, it is likely,but not guaranteed that he or she does not have the gene.Both prospective parents must be carriers of the gene tohave a child with cystic fibrosis.\nTay-Sachs disease , also autosomal recessive, affects\nchildren primarily of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Childrenwith this disease die between the ages of two and five. Thisdisease was previously detected by looking for a missingenzyme. The mutated gene has now been identified and canbe detected using direct DNA mutation analysis.\nPresymptomatic testing\nNot all genetic diseases show their effect immediate-\nly at birth or early in childhood. Although the gene muta-tion is present at birth, some diseases do-not appear untiladulthood. If a specific mutated gene responsible for alate-onset disease has been identified, a person from anaffected family can be tested before symptoms appear.\nHuntington’s disease is one example of a late-onset\nautosomal dominant disease. Its symptoms of mental con-fusion and abnormal body movements do not appear until\nmiddle to late adulthood. The chromosome location of thegene responsible for Huntington’s chorea was located in1983 after studying the DNA from a large Venezuelanfamily affected by the disease. Ten years later the genewas identified. A test is now available to detect the pres-ence of the expanded base pair sequence responsible forcausing the disease. The presence of this expandedsequence means the person will develop the disease.\nAnother late onset disease, Alzheimer’s does not\nhave as well a understood genetic cause as Huntington’sdisease. The specific genetic cause of Alzheimer’s dis-\nease is not as clear. Although many cases appear to be\ninherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, many casesexist as single incidents in a family. Like Huntington’s,symptoms of mental deterioration first appear in adult-hood. Genetic research has found an association betweenthis disease and genes on four different chromosomes.The validity of looking for these genes in a person with-out symptoms or without family history of the disease isstill being studied.\nCANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING. Cancer can result\nfrom an inherited (germline) mutated gene or a gene thatmutated sometime during a person’s lifetime (acquiredmutation). Some genes, called tumor suppressor genes,produce proteins that protect the body from cancer. Ifone of these genes develops a mutation, it is unable toproduce the protective protein. If the second copy of thegene is normal, its action may be sufficient to continueproduction, but if that gene later also develops a muta-tion, the person is vulnerable to cancer. Other genes,called oncogenes, are involved in the normal growth ofcells. A mutation in an oncogene can cause too muchgrowth, the beginning of cancer.\nDirect DNA tests are currently available to look for\ngene mutations identified and linked to several kinds ofcancer. People with a family history of these cancers arethose most likely to be tested. If one of these mutatedgenes is found, the person is more susceptible to devel-oping the cancer. The likelihood that the person willdevelop the cancer, even with the mutated gene, is notalways known because other genetic and environmentalfactors are also involved in the development of cancer.\nCancer susceptibility tests are most useful when a\npositive test result can be followed with clear treatmentoptions. In families with familial polyposis of the colon,\ntesting a child for a mutated APC gene can revealwhether or not the child needs frequent monitoring forthe disease. In families with potentially fatal familialmedullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neopla-\nsia type 2, finding a mutated RET gene in a child pro-vides the opportunity for that child to have preventive\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1436Genetic testingremoval of the thyroid gland. In the same way, MSH1\nand MSH2 mutations can reveal which members in anaffected family are vulnerable to familiar colorectal can-cer and would benefit from aggressive monitoring.\nIn 1994, a mutation linked to early-onset familial\nbreast and ovarian cancer was identified. BRCA1 is locat-\ned on chromosome 17. Women with a mutated form of thisgene have an increased risk of developing breast and ovari-an cancer. A second related gene, BRCA2, was later dis-covered. Located on chromosome 13, it also carriesincreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Although bothgenes are rare in the general population, they are slightlymore common in women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.\nWhen a woman is found to have a mutation of one of\nthese genes, the likelihood that she will get breast orovarian cancer increases, but not to 100%. Other geneticand environmental factors influence the outcome.\nTesting for these genes is most valuable in families\nwhere a mutation has already been found. BRCA1 andBRCA2 are large genes; BRCA1 includes 100,000 bases.More than 120 mutations to this gene have been discov-ered, but a mutation could occur in any one of the bases.Studies show tests for these genes may miss 30% ofexisting mutations. The rate of missed mutations, theunknown disease likelihood in spite of a positive result,and the lack of a clear preventive response to a positiveresult, make the value of this test for the general popula-tion uncertain.\nPrenatal and postnatal chromosome analysis\nChromosome analysis can be done on fetal cells pri-\nmarily when the mother is age 35 or older at the time ofdelivery, experienced multiple miscarriages, or reports afamily history of a genetic abnormality. Prenatal testingis done on the fetal cells from a chorionic villi sampling(from the baby’s developing placenta) at 9–12 weeks orfrom the amniotic fluid (the fluid surrounding the baby)at 15–22 weeks of pregnancy. Cells from amniotic fluidgrow for seven to 10 days before they are ready to beanalyzed. Chorionic villi cells have the potential to growfaster and can be analyzed sooner.\nChromosome analysis using blood cells is done on a\nchild who is born with or later develops signs of mental\nretardation or physical malformation. In the older child,\nchromosome analysis may be done to investigate devel-opmental delays.\nExtra or missing chromosomes cause mental and\nphysical abnormalities. A child born with an extra chro-mosome 21 (trisomy 21) has Down syndrome. An extrachromosome 13 or 18 also produce well known syn-dromes. A missing X chromosome causes Turner syn-drome and an extra X in a male causes Klinefelter syn-\ndrome . Other abnormalities are caused by extra or miss-\ning pieces of chromosomes. Fragile X syndrome is a\nsex-linked disease, causing mental retardation in males.\nChromosome material may also be rearranged, such\nas the end of chromosome 1 moved to the end of chro-mosome 3.This is called a chromosomal translocation. Ifno material is added or deleted in the exchange, the per-son may not be affected. Such an exchange, however, cancause infertility or abnormalities if passed to children.\nEvaluation of a man and woman’s infertility or\nrepeated miscarriages will include blood studies of bothto check for a chromosome translocation. Many chromo-some abnormalities are incompatible with life; babieswith these abnormalities often miscarrry during the firsttrimester. Cells from a baby that died before birth can bestudied to look for chromosome abnormalities that mayhave caused the death .\nCancer diagnosis and prognosis\nCertain cancers, particularly leukemia and lym-\nphoma, are associated with changes in chromosomes:extra or missing complete chromosomes, extra or miss-ing portions of chromosomes, or exchanges of material(translocations) between chromosomes. Studies showthat the locations of the chromosome breaks are at loca-tions of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes.\nChromosome analysis on cells from blood, bone\nmarrow, or solid tumor helps diagnose certain kinds ofleukemia and lymphoma and often helps predict howwell the person will respond to treatment. After treatmenthas begun, periodic monitoring of these chromosomechanges in the blood and bone marrow gives the physi-cian information as to the effectiveness of the treatment.\nA well-known chromosome rearrangement is found\nin chronic myelogenous leukemia. This leukemia is asso-ciated with an exchange of material between chromo-somes 9 and 22. The resulting smaller chromosome 22 iscalled the Philadelphia chromosome.\nPreparation\nMost tests for genetic diseases of children and adults\nare done on blood. To collect the 5–10 mL of blood need-ed, a healthcare worker draws blood from a vein in theinner elbow region. Collection of the sample takes only afew minutes.\nPrenatal testing is done either on amniotic fluid or a\nchorionic villus sampling . To collect amniotic fluid, a\nphysician performs a procedure called amniocentesis . An\nultrasound is done to find the baby’s position and an areafilled with amniotic fluid. The physician inserts a needle\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1437Genetic testingthrough the woman’s skin and the wall of her uterus and\nwithdraws 5–10 mL of amniotic fluid. Placental tissue fora chorionic villus sampling is taken through the cervix.Each procedures take approximately 30 minutes.\nBone marrow is used for chromosome analysis in a\nperson with leukemia or lymphoma. The person is givenlocal anesthesia. Then the physician inserts a needlethrough the skin and into the bone (usually the sternumor hip bone). One-half to 2 mL of bone marrow is with-drawn. This procedure takes approximately 30 minutes.\nAftercare\nAfter blood collection the person can feel discom-\nfort or bruising at the puncture site or may become dizzyor faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the bleedingstops reduces bruising. Warm packs to the puncture siterelieve discomfort.\nThe chorionic villi sampling, amniocentesis and\nbone marrow procedures are all done under a physician’ssupervision. The person is asked to rest after the proce-dure and is watched for weakness and signs of bleeding.\nRisks\nCollection of amniotic fluid and chorionic villi sam-\npling, have the risk of miscarriage , infection, and bleed-\ning; the risks are higher for the chorionic villi sampling.Because of the potential risks for miscarriage, 0.5% fol-lowing the amniocentesis and 1% following the chorionicvilli sampling procedure, both of these prenatal tests areoffered to couples, but not required. A woman should tellher physician immediately if she has cramping, bleeding,fluid loss, an increased temperature, or a change in thebaby’s movement following either of these procedures.\nAfter bone marrow collection, the puncture site may\nbecome tender and the person’s temperature may rise.These are signs of a possible infection.\nGenetic testing involves other nonphysical risks.\nMany people fear the possible loss of privacy about per-sonal health information. Results of genetic tests may bereported to insurance companies and affect a person’sinsurability. Some people pay out-of-pocket for genetictests to avoid this possibility. Laws have been proposedto deal with this problem. Other family members may beaffected by the results of a person’s genetic test. Privacyof the person tested and the family members affected is aconsideration when deciding to have a test and to sharethe results.\nA positive result carries a psychological burden,\nespecially if the test indicates the person will develop adisease, such as Huntington’s chorea. The news that a per-son may be susceptible to a specific kind of cancer, while\nit may encourage positive preventive measures, may alsonegatively shadow many decisions and activities.\nA genetic test result may also be inconclusive mean-\ning no definitive result can be given to the individual orfamily. This may cause the individual to feel more anxiousand frustrated and experience psychological difficulties.\nPrior to undergoing genetic testing, individuals need\nto learn from the genetic counselor the likelihood that thetest could miss a mutation or abnormality.\nNormal results\nA normal result for chromosome analysis is 46, XX\nor 46, XY . This means there are 46 chromosomes(including two X chromosomes for a female or one Xand one Y for a male) with no structural abnormalities. Anormal result for a direct DNA mutation analysis or link-age study is no gene mutation found.\nThere can be some benefits from genetic testing\nwhen the individual tested is not found to carry a geneticmutation. Those who learn with great certainty they areno longer at risk for a genetic disease, may choose not toundergo prophylactic therapies and may feel less anxiousand relieved.\nAbnormal results\nAn abnormal chromosome analysis report will\ninclude the total number of chromosomes and will identi-fy the abnormality found. Tests for gene mutations willreport the mutations found.\nThere are many ethical issues to consider with an\nabnormal prenatal test result. Many of the diseases testedfor during a pregnancy, cannot be treated or cured. Inaddition, some diseases tested for during pregnancy, mayhave a late-onset of symptoms or have minimal effectson the affected individual.\nBefore making decisions based on an abnormal test\nresult, the person should meet again with a genetic coun-selor to fully understand the meaning of the results, learnwhat options are available based on the test result, andwhat are the risks and benefits of each of those options.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerg, Paul, and Maxine Singer.

    "title": "Genital herpes",
    "content": "Genital herpes\nDefinition\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease\ncaused by a herpes virus. The disease is characterized bythe formation of fluid-filled, painful blisters in the geni-tal area.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1439Genital herpesDescription\nGenital herpes (herpes genitalis, herpes progenitalis)\nis characterized by the formation of fluid-filled blisterson the genital organs of men and women. The word “her-pes” comes from the Greek adjective herpestes, meaning\ncreeping, which refers to the serpent-like pattern that the\nblisters may form. Genital herpes is a sexually transmit-ted disease which means that it is spread from person-to-person only by sexual contact. Herpes may be spread byvaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity. It is not spread byobjects (such as a toilet seat or doorknob), swimmingpools, hot tubs, or through the air.\nGenital herpes is a disease resulting from an infec-\ntion by a herpes simplex virus. There are eight differentkinds of human herpes viruses. Only two of these, herpessimplex types 1 and 2, can cause genital herpes. It hasbeen commonly believed that herpes simplex virus type 1infects above the waist (causing cold sores) and herpessimplex virus type 2 infects below the waist (causinggenital sores). This is not completely true. Both herpesvirus type 1 and type 2 can cause herpes lesions on thelips or genitals, but recurrent cold sores are almostalways type 1. The two viruses seem to have evolved toinfect better at one site or the other, especially withregard to recurrent disease.\nTo determine the occurrence of herpes type 2 infec-\ntion in the United States, the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC) used information from a surveycalled the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey III (1988–1994). This survey of 40,000 noninsti-tutionalized people found that 21.9% of persons age 12or older had antibodies to herpes type 2. This means that45 million Americans have been exposed at some pointin their lives to herpes simplex virus type 2. Morewomen (25.6%) than men (17.8%) had antibodies. Theracial differences for herpes type 2 antibodies werewhites, 17.6%; blacks, 45.9%; and Mexican Americans,22.3%. Interestingly, only 2.6% of adults reported thatthey have had genital herpes. Over half (50% to 60%) ofthe white adults in the United States have antibodies toherpes simplex virus type 1. The occurrence of antibod-ies to herpes type 1 is higher in blacks.\nViruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria\nare independent and can reproduce on their own, virusescannot reproduce without the help of a cell. Viruses enterhuman cells and force them to make more virus. Ahuman cell infected with herpes virus releases thousandsof new viruses before it is killed. The cell death and\nresulting tissue damage causes the actual sores. Thehighest risk for spreading the virus is the time periodbeginning with the appearance of blisters and endingwith scab formation.Herpes virus can also infect a cell and instead of\nmaking the cell produce new viruses, it hides inside thecell and waits. Herpes virus hides in cells of the nervoussystem called “neurons.” This is called “latency.” A latentvirus can wait inside neurons for days, months, or evenyears. At some future time, the virus “awakens” andcauses the cell to produce thousands of new viruseswhich causes an active infection. Sometimes an activeinfection occurs without visible sores. Therefore, aninfected person can spread herpes virus to other peopleeven in the absence of sores.\nThis process of latency and active infection is best\nunderstood by considering the genital sore cycle. Anactive infection is obvious because sores are present. Thefirst infection is called the “primary” infection. Thisactive infection is then controlled by the body’s immunesystem and the sores heal. In between active infections,the virus is latent. At some point in the future latentviruses become activated and once again cause sores.These are called “recurrent infections” or “outbreaks.”Genital sores caused by herpes type 1 recur much lessfrequently than sores caused by herpes type 2.\nAlthough it is unknown what triggers latent viruses\nto activate, several conditions seem to bring on infec-tions. These include illness, tiredness, exposure to sun-light, menstruation, skin damage, food allergy and hot orcold temperatures. Although many people believe thatstress can bring on their genital herpes outbreaks, there\nis no scientific evidence that there is a link betweenstress and recurrences. However, at least one clinicalstudy has shown a connection between how well peoplecope with stress and their belief that stress and recurrentinfections are linked.\nNewborn babies who are infected with herpes virus\nexperience a very severe, and possibly fatal disease. Thisis called “neonatal herpes infection.” In the UnitedStates, one in 3,000–5,000 babies born will be infectedwith herpes virus. Babies can become infected duringpassage through the birth canal, but can become infectedduring the pregnancy if the membranes rupture early.\nDoctors will perform a Cesarean section on women who\ngo into labor with active genital herpes.\nCauses and symptoms\nWhile anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not\neveryone will show symptoms. Risk factors for genitalherpes include: early age at first sexual activity, multiplesexual partners, and a medical history of other sexually-transmitted diseases.\nMost patients with genital herpes experience a pro-\ndrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of pain , burn-\ning, itching , or tingling at the site where blisters will\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1440Genital herpesform. This prodrome stage may last anywhere from a few\nhours, to one to two days. The herpes infection prodromecan occur for both the primary infection and recurrentinfections. The prodrome for recurrent infections may besevere and cause a severe burning or stabbing pain in thegenital area, legs, or buttocks.\nPrimary genital herpes\nThe first symptoms of herpes usually occur within\ntwo to seven days after contact with an infected personbut may take up to two weeks. Symptoms of the primaryinfection are usually more severe than those of recurrentinfections. For up to 70% of the patients, the primaryinfection causes symptoms which affect the whole body(called “constitutional symptoms”) including tiredness,headache ,fever , chills, muscle aches, loss of appetite, as\nwell as painful, swollen lymph nodes in the groin. Thesesymptoms are greatest during the first three to four daysof the infection and disappear within one week. The pri-mary infection is more severe in women than in men.\nFollowing the prodrome come the herpes blisters,\nwhich are similar on men and women. First, small redbumps appear. These bumps quickly become fluid-filledblisters. In dry areas, the blisters become filled with pusand take on a white to gray appearance, become coveredwith a scab, and heal within two to three weeks. In moistareas, the fluid-filled blisters burst and form painfululcers which drain before healing. New blisters mayappear over a period of one week or longer and may jointogether to form very large ulcers. The pain is relievedwithin two weeks and the blisters and ulcers heal withoutscarring by three to four weeks.\nWomen can experience a very severe and painful\nprimary infection. Herpes blisters first appear on thelabia majora (outer lips), labia minora (inner lips), andentrance to the vagina. Blisters often appear on the cli-toris, at the urinary opening, around the anal opening,and on the buttocks and thighs. In addition, women mayget herpes blisters on the lips, breasts, fingers, and eyes.The vagina and cervix are almost always involved whichcauses a watery discharge. Other symptoms that occur inwomen are: painful or difficult urination (83%), swellingof the urinary tube (85%), meningitis (36%), and throat\ninfection (13%). Most women develop painful, swollenlymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) in the groin and pelvis.About one in ten women get a vaginal yeast infection asa complication of the primary herpes infection.\nIn men, the herpes blisters usually form on the penis\nbut can also appear on the scrotum, thighs, and buttocks.Fewer than half of the men with primary herpes experi-ence the constitutional symptoms. Thirty percent to 40%of men have a discharge from the urinary tube. Somemen develop painful swollen lymph nodes (lym-\nphadenopathy) in the groin and pelvis. Although less fre-quently than women, men too may experience painful ordifficult urination (44%), swelling of the urinary tube(27%), meningitis (13%), and throat infection (7%).\nRecurrent genital herpes\nOne or more outbreaks of genital herpes per year\noccur in 60–90% of those infected with herpes virus.About 40% of the persons infected with herpes simplexvirus type 2 will experience six or more outbreaks eachyear. Genital herpes recurrences are less severe than theprimary infection; however, women still experience moresevere symptoms and pain than men. Constitutionalsymptoms are not usually present. Blisters will appear atthe same sites during each outbreak. Usually there arefewer blisters, less pain, and the time period from thebeginning of symptoms to healing is shorter than the pri-mary infection. One out of every four women experiencepainful or difficult urination during recurrent infection.Both men and women may develop lymphadenopathy.\nDiagnosis\nBecause genital herpes is so common, it is diag-\nnosed primarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed andtreated by the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors whospecialize in skin diseases), urologists (doctors who spe-cialize in the urinary tract diseases of men and womenand the genital organs of men), gynecologists (doctorswho specialize in the diseases of women’s genitalorgans) and infectious disease specialists. The diagnosisand treatment of this infectious disease should be cov-ered by most insurance providers.\nLaboratory tests may be performed to look for the\nvirus. Because healing sores do not shed much virus, a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1441Genital herpes\nFemale cervix covered with herpes lesions (Photo\nResearchers. Reproduced by permission.)sample from an open sore would be taken for viral cul-\nture. A sterile cotton swab would be wiped over opensores and the sample used to infect human cells in culture.Cells which are killed by herpes virus have a certainappearance under microscopic examination. The resultsof this test are available within two to ten days. Otherareas which may be sampled, depending upon the diseasesymptoms in a particular patient, include the urinary tract,vagina, cervix, throat, eye tissues, and cerebrospinal fluid.\nDirect staining and microscopic examination of the\nlesion sample may also be used. A blood test may be per-formed to see if the patient has antibodies to herpesvirus. The results of blood testing are available withinone day. The disadvantage of this blood test is that it usu-ally does not distinguish between herpes type 1 and 2,and only determines that the patient has had a herpesinfection at some point in his or her life. Therefore, theviral culture test must be performed to be absolutely cer-tain that the sores are caused by herpes virus.\nBecause genital sores can be symptoms of many\nother diseases, the doctor must determine the exact causeof the sores. The above mentioned tests are performed todetermine that herpes virus is causing the genital sores.Other diseases which may cause genital sores aresyphilis ,chancroid ,lymphogranuloma venereum ,\ngranuloma inguinale , herpes zoster, erythema multi-\nform, Behçet’s syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease,contact dermatitis ,candidiasis , and impetigo .Because most newborns who are infected with her-\npes virus were born to mothers who had no symptoms ofinfection it is important to check all newborn babies forsymptoms. Any skin sore should be sampled to deter-mine if it is caused by herpes simplex. Babies should bechecked for sores in their mouth and for signs of herpesinfection in their eyes.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for herpes virus infections. There\nare antiviral drugs available which have some effect in\nlessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of her-pes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also pre-vent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs work byinterfering with the replication of the viruses and aremost effective when taken as early in the infectionprocess as possible. For the best results, drug treatmentshould begin during the prodrome stage before blistersare visible. Depending on the length of the outbreak,drug treatment could continue for up to 10 days.\nAcyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes\ninfection and can be given intravenously, taken by mouth(orally), or applied directly to sores as an ointment. Acy-clovir has been in use for many years and only five out of100 patients experience side effects. Side effects of acy-clovir treatment include nausea, vomiting, itchy rash, andhives . Although acyclovir is the recommended drug for\ntreating herpes infections, other drugs may be usedincluding famciclovir (Famvir), valacyclovir (Valtrex),vidarabine (Vira-A), idoxuridine (Herplex Liquifilm,Stoxil), trifluorothymidine (Viroptic), and penciclovir(Denavir).\nAcyclovir is effective in treating both the primary\ninfection and recurrent outbreaks. When taken intra-venously or orally, acyclovir reduces the healing time,virus shedding period, and duration of vesicles. The stan-dard oral dose of acyclovir for primary herpes is 200 mgfive times daily or 400 mg three times daily for a periodof 10 days. Recurrent herpes is treated with the samedoses for a period of five days. Intravenous acyclovir isgiven to patients who require hospitalization because ofsevere primary infections or herpes complications suchas aseptic meningitis or sacral ganglionitis (inflammationof nerve bundles).\nPatients with frequent outbreaks (greater than six to\neight per year) may benefit from long term use of acy-clovir which is called “suppressive therapy.” Patients onsuppressive therapy have longer periods between herpesoutbreaks. The specific dosage used for suppressionneeds to be determined for each patient and should bereevaluated every few years. Alternatively, patients mayuse short term suppressive therapy to lessen the chance\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1442Genital herpes\nA close-up view of a man’s penis with a blister (center of\nimage) caused by the herpes simplex virus. (Photograph by\nDr. P . Marazzi, Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced bypermission.)of developing an active infection during special occa-\nsions such as weddings or holidays.\nThere are several things that a patient may do to\nlessen the pain of genital sores. Wearing loose fittingclothing and cotton underwear is helpful. Removingclothing or wearing loose pajamas while at home mayreduce pain. Soaking in a tub of warm water and using ablow dryer on the “cool” setting to dry the infected areais helpful. Putting an ice pack on the affected area for 10minutes, followed by five minutes off and then repeatingthis procedure may relieve pain. A zinc sulfate ointmentmay help to heal the sores. Application of a baking sodacompress to sores may be soothing.\nNeonatal herpes\nNewborn babies with herpes virus infections are\ntreated with intravenous acyclovir or vidarabine for 10days. These drugs have greatly reduced deaths andincreased the number of babies who appear normal at oneyear of age. However, because neonatal herpes infectionis so serious, even with treatment babies may not survive,or may suffer nervous system damage. Infected babiesmay be treated with long term suppressive therapy.\nAlternative treatment\nAn imbalance in the amino acids lysine and arginine\nis thought to be one contributing factor in herpes virusoutbreaks. A ratio of lysine to arginine that is in balance(that is more lysine than arginine is present) seems to helpthe immune system work optimally. Thus, a diet that isrich in lysine may help prevent recurrences of genital her-pes. Foods that contain high levels of lysine include mostvegetables, legumes, fish, turkey, beef, lamb, cheese, andchicken. Patients may take 500 mg of lysine daily andincrease to 1,000 mg three times a day during an out-break. Intake of the amino acid arginine should bereduced. Foods rich in arginine that should be avoided arechocolate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds.\nClinical experience indicates a connection between\nhigh stress and herpes outbreaks. Some patients respondwell to stress reduction and relaxation techniques. Acu-\npressure and massage may relieve tiredness and stress.\nMeditation ,yoga ,tai chi , and hypnotherapy can also\nhelp relieve stress and promote relaxation.\nSome herbs, including echinacea (Echinacea spp.)\nand garlic ( Allium sativum ), are believed to strengthen\nthe body’s defenses against viral infections. Red marinealgae (family Dumontiaceae), both taken internally andapplied topically, is thought to be effective in treatingherpes type I and type II infections.

An oint-ment made with glycyrrhizinic acid, a component oflicorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ), seems to inactivate the\nvirus. Topical applications of vitamin E or tea tree oil(Melaleuca spp.) help dry up herpes sores. Specific com-\nbinations of homeopathic remedies may also be helpfultreatments for genital herpes.\nPrognosis\nAlthough physically and emotionally painful, geni-\ntal herpes is usually not a serious disease. The primaryinfection can be severe and may require hospitalizationfor treatment. Complications of the primary infectionmay involve the cervix, urinary system, anal opening,and the nervous system. Persons who have a decreasedability to produce an immune response to infection(called “immunocompromised”) due to disease or med-ication are at risk for a very severe, and possibly fatal,herpes infection. Even with antiviral treatment, neonatalherpes infections can be fatal or cause permanent ner-vous system damage.\nPrevention\nThe only way to prevent genital herpes is to avoid\ncontact with infected persons.

    "title": "Genital warts",
    "content": "Genital warts\nDefinition\nGenital warts , which are also called condylomata\nacuminata or venereal warts, are growths in the genitalarea caused by a sexually transmitted papillomavirus. Apapillomavirus is a virus that produces papillomas, orbenign growths on the skin and mucous membranes.\nDescription\nGenital warts are the most common sexually trans-\nmitted disease (STD) in the general population. It is esti-mated that 1% of sexually active people between the agesof 18 and 45 have genital warts; however, polymerasechain reaction (PCR) testing indicates that as many as40% of sexually active adults carry the human papillo-mavirus (HPV) that causes genital warts.\nGenital warts vary somewhat in appearance. They\nmay be either flat or resemble raspberries or cauliflowerin appearance. The warts begin as small red or pinkgrowths and grow as large as four inches across, interfer-ing with intercourse and childbirth . The warts grow in\nthe moist tissues of the genital areas. In women, theyoccur on the external genitals and on the walls of thevagina and cervix; in men, they develop in the urethraand on the shaft of the penis. The warts then spread to thearea behind the genitals surrounding the anus.\nRisk factors for genital warts include:• multiple sexual partners\n• infection with another STD• pregnancy\n• anal intercourse\n• poor personal hygiene\n• heavy perspiration\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are about 80 types of human papillomavirus.\nGenital warts are caused by HPV types 1, 2, 6, 11, 16,and 18. HPV is transmitted by sexual contact. The incu-bation period varies from one to six months.\nThe symptoms include bleeding, pain , and odor as\nwell as the visible warts.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is usually made by examining scrap-\nings from the warts under a darkfield microscope. If thewarts are caused by HPV , they will turn white when a 5%solution of white vinegar is added. If the warts reappear,the doctor may order a biopsy to rule out cancer .\nTreatment\nNo treatment for genital warts is completely effective\nbecause therapy depends on destroying skin infected by thevirus. There are no drugs that will kill the virus directly.\nMedications\nGenital warts were treated until recently with applica-\ntions of podophyllum resin, a corrosive substance that can-not be given to pregnant patients. A milder form ofpodophyllum, podofilox (Condylox), has been introduced.Women are also treated with 5-fluorouracil cream,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1444Genital wartsbichloroacetic acid, or trichloroacetic acid. All of these\nsubstances irritate the skin and require weeks of treatment.\nGenital warts can also be treated with injections of\ninterferon. Interferon works best in combination withpodofilox applications.\nSurgery\nSurgery may be necessary to remove warts blocking\nthe patient’s vagina, urethra, or anus. Surgical techniquesinclude the use of liquid nitrogen, electrosurgery, andlaser surgery .\nPrognosis\nGenital warts are benign growths and are not cancer-\nous by themselves. Repeated HPV infection in women,however, appears to increase the risk of later cervical\ncancer . Women infected with HPV types 16 and 18\nshould have yearly cervical smears. Recurrence is com-mon with all present methods of treatment—includingsurgery—because HPV can remain latent in apparentlynormal surrounding skin.\nPrevention\nThe only reliable method of prevention is sexual\nabstinence. The use of condoms minimizes but does noteliminate the risk of HPV transmission. The patient’ssexual contacts should be notified and examined.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerger, Timothy G. “Skin and Appendages.” In Current Med-\nical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1996. 35th ed. Ed.

    "title": "Gestalt therapy",
    "content": "Gestalt therapy\nDefinition\nGestalt therapy is a humanistic therapy technique\nthat focuses on gaining an awareness of emotions andbehaviors in the present rather than in the past. The thera-pist does not interpret experiences for the patient.Instead, the therapist and patient work together to helpthe patient understand him/herself. This type of therapyfocuses on experiencing the present situation rather thantalking about what occurred in the past. Patients areencouraged to become aware of immediate needs, meetthem, and let them recede into the background. The well-adjusted person is seen as someone who has a constantflow of needs and is able to satisfy those needs.\nPurpose\nIn Gestalt therapy (from the German word meaning\nform ), the major goal is self-awareness. Patients work on\nuncovering and resolving interpersonal issues during\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1445Gestalt therapytherapy. Unresolved issues are unable to fade into the\nbackground of consciousness because the needs they rep-resent are never met. In Gestalt therapy, the goal is to dis-cover people connected with a patient’s unresolvedissues and try to engage those people (or images of thosepeople) in interactions that can lead to a resolution.Gestalt therapy is most useful for patients open to work-ing on self-awareness.\nPrecautions\nThe choice of a therapist is crucial. Some people\nwho call themselves “therapists” have limited training inGestalt therapy. It is important that the therapist be alicensed mental health professional. Additionally, someindividuals may not be able to tolerate the intensity ofthis type of therapy.\nDescription\nGestalt therapy has developed into a form of therapy\nthat emphasizes medium to large groups, although manyGestalt techniques can be used in one-on-one therapy.Gestalt therapy probably has a greater range of formatsthan any other therapy technique. It is practiced in indi-vidual, couples, and family therapies, as well as in thera-py with children.\nIdeally, the patient identifies current sensations and\nemotions, particularly ones that are painful or disruptive.Patients are confronted with their unconscious feelingsand needs, and are assisted to accept and assert thoserepressed parts of themselves.\nThe most powerful techniques involve role-play-\ning. For example, the patient talks to an empty chair asthey imagine that a person associated with an unre-solved issue is sitting in the chair. As the patient talksto the “person” in the chair, the patient imagines thatthe person responds to the expressed feelings.Although this technique may sound artificial and mightmake some people feel self-conscious, it can be a pow-erful way to approach buried feelings and gain newinsight into them.\nSometimes patients use battacca bats, padded sticks\nthat can be used to hit chairs or sofas. Using a battaccabat can help a patient safely express anger. A patient mayalso experience a Gestalt therapy marathon, where theparticipants and one or more facilitators have nonstopgroup therapy over a weekend. The effects of the\nintense emotion and the lack of sleep can eliminate manypsychological defenses and allow significant progress tobe made in a short time. This is true only if the patienthas adequate psychological strength for a marathon andis carefully monitored by the therapist.Preparation\nGestalt therapy begins with the first contact. There is\nno separate diagnostic or assessment period. Instead,assessment and screening are done as part of the ongoingrelationship between patient and therapist. This assess-ment includes determining the patient’s willingness andsupport for work using Gestalt methods, as well as deter-mining the compatibility between the patient and thetherapist. Unfortunately, some “encounter groups” led bypoorly trained individuals do not provide adequate pre-therapy screening and assessment.\nAftercare\nSessions are usually held once a week. Frequency of\nsessions held is based on how long the patient can gobetween sessions without losing the momentum from theprevious session. Patients and therapists discuss when tostart sessions, when to stop sessions, and what kind ofactivities to use during a session. However, the patient isencouraged and required to make choices.\nRisks\nDisturbed people with severe mental illness may not\nbe suitable candidates for Gestalt therapy. Facilities thatprovide Gestalt therapy and train Gestalt therapists vary.Since there are no national standards for these Gestaltfacilities, there are no set national standards for Gestalttherapy or Gestalt therapists.\nNormal results\nScientific documentation on the effectiveness of\nGestalt therapy is limited. Evidence suggests that thistype of therapy may not be reliably effective.\nAbnormal results\nThis approach can be anti-intellectual and can dis-\ncount thoughts, thought patterns, and beliefs. In thehands of an ineffective therapist, Gestalt procedures canbecome a series of mechanical exercises, allowing thetherapist as a person to stay hidden. Moreover, there is apotential for the therapist to manipulate the patient withpowerful techniques, especially in therapy marathonswhere fatigue may make a patient vulnerable.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEllis, Willis D.

    "title": "Gestational diabetes",
    "content": "Gestational diabetes\nDefinition\nGestational diabetes is a condition that occurs dur-\ning pregnancy . Like other forms of diabetes, gestational\ndiabetes involves a defect in the way the body processesand uses sugars (glucose) in the diet. Gestational dia-betes, however, has a number of characteristics that aredifferent from other forms of diabetes.\nDescription\nGlucose is a form of sugar that is present in many\nfoods, including sweets, potatoes, pasta, and breads. Thebody uses glucose to provide energy. It is stored in theliver, muscles, and fatty tissue. The pancreas produces ahormone (a chemical produced in one part of the body,which travels to another part of the body in order to exertits effect) called insulin. Insulin is required to allow glu-cose to enter the liver, muscles, and fatty tissues, thusreducing the amount of glucose in the blood. In diabetes,blood levels of glucose remain abnormally high. In manyforms of diabetes, this is because the pancreas does notproduce enough insulin.\nIn gestational diabetes, the pancreas is not at fault.\nInstead, the problem is in the placenta. During pregnancy,the placenta provides the baby with nourishment. It alsoproduces a number of hormones that interfere with thebody’s usual response to insulin. This condition isreferred to as “insulin resistance.” Most pregnant womendo not suffer from gestational diabetes, because the pan-creas works to produce extra quantities of insulin in orderto compensate for insulin resistance. However, when awoman’s pancreas cannot produce enough extra insulin,blood levels of glucose stay abnormally high, and thewoman is considered to have gestational diabetes.About 1–3% of all pregnant women develop gesta-\ntional diabetes. Women at risk for gestational diabetesinclude those who:\n• are overweight\n• have a family history of diabetes\n• have previously given birth to a very large, heavy baby\n• have previously had a baby who was stillborn, or born\nwith a birth defect\n• have an excess amount of amniotic fluid (the cushion-\ning fluid within the uterus that surrounds the develop-ing fetus)\n• are over 25 years of age\n• belong to an ethnic group known to experience higher\nrates of gestational diabetes (in the United States, thesegroups include Mexican-Americans, American Indians,African-Americans, as well as individuals from Asia,India, or the Pacific Islands)\n• have a previous history of gestational diabetes during a\npregnancy\nCauses and symptoms\nMost women with gestational diabetes have no recog-\nnizable symptoms. However, leaving gestational diabetesundiagnosed and untreated is risky to the developing fetus.Left untreated, a diabetic mother’s blood sugar levels willbe consistently high. This sugar will cross the placenta andpour into the baby’s system through the umbilical cord.The unborn baby’s pancreas will respond to this high levelof sugar by constantly putting out large amounts ofinsulin. The insulin will allow the fetus’s cells to take inglucose, where it will be converted to fat and stored. Ababy who has been exposed to constantly high levels ofsugar throughout pregnancy will be abnormally large.Such a baby will often grow so large that he or she cannotbe born through the vagina, but will instead need to beborn through a surgical procedure ( cesarean section ).\nFurthermore, when the baby is born, the baby will\nstill have an abnormally large amount of insulin circulat-ing. After birth, when the mother and baby are no longerattached to each other via the placenta and umbilicalcord, the baby will no longer be receiving the mother’shigh level of sugar. The baby’s high level of insulin, how-ever, will very quickly use up the glucose circulating inthe baby’s bloodstream. The baby is then at risk for hav-ing a dangerously low level of blood glucose (a conditioncalled hypoglycemia ).\nDiagnosis\nSince gestational diabetes most often exists with no\nsymptoms detectable by the patient, and since its existence\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1447Gestational diabetesputs the developing baby at considerable risk, screening\nfor the disorder is a routine part of pregnancy care. Thisscreening is usually done between the 24th and 28th weekof pregnancy. By this point in the pregnancy, the placentalhormones have reached a sufficient level to cause insulinresistance. Screening for gestational diabetes involves thepregnant woman drinking a special solution that containsexactly 50 grams of glucose. An hour later, the woman’sblood is drawn and tested for its glucose level. A level lessthan 140 mg/dl is considered normal.\nWhen the screening glucose level is over 140 mg/dl,\na special three-hour glucose tolerance test is performed.This involves following a special diet for three days priorto the test. This diet is set-up to contain at least 150 gramsof carbohydrate each day. Just before the test, the patientis instructed to eat and drink nothing (except water) for10–14 hours. A blood sample is then tested to determinethe fasting glucose level. The patient then drinks a special\nsolution containing exactly 100 grams of glucose, and herblood is tested every hour for the next three hours. If twoor more of these levels are elevated over normal, then thepatient is considered to have gestational diabetes.\nTreatment\nTreatment for gestational diabetes will depend on the\nseverity of the diabetes. Mild forms can be treated withdiet (decreasing the intake of sugars and fats, in particu-lar). Many women are put on strict, detailed diets , and are\nasked to stay within a certain range of calorie intake.Exercise is sometimes used to keep blood sugar levels\nlower. Patients are often asked to regularly measure theirblood sugar. This is done by poking a finger with a needlecalled a lancet, putting a drop of blood on a special type ofpaper, and feeding the paper into a meter which analyzesand reports the blood sugar level. When diet and exercisedo not keep blood glucose levels within an acceptablerange, a patient may need to take regular shots of insulin.KEY TERMS\nGlucose —A form of sugar. The final product of the\nbreakdown of carbohydrates (starches).\nInsulin —A hormone produced by the pancreas\nthat is central to the processing of sugars and car-bohydrates in the diet.\nPlacenta —An organ that is attached to the inside\nwall of the mother’s uterus and to the fetus via theumbilical cord. The placenta allows oxygen andnutrients from the mother’s bloodstream to passinto the unborn baby.Many babies born to women with gestational dia-\nbetes are large enough to cause more difficult deliveries,and they may require the use of forceps, suction, orcesarean section. Once the baby is born, it is important tocarefully monitor its blood glucose levels. These levelsmay drop sharply and dangerously once the baby is nolonger receiving large quantities of sugar from the moth-er. When this occurs, it is easily resolved by giving thebaby glucose.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis for women with gestational diabetes, and\ntheir babies, is generally good. Almost all such womenstop being diabetic after the birth of their baby. However,some research has shown that nearly 50% of thesewomen will develop a permanent form of diabetes within15 years. The child of a mother with gestational diabeteshas a greater-than-normal chance of developing diabetessometime in adulthood, also. A woman who has had ges-tational diabetes during one pregnancy has about a 66%chance of having it again during any subsequent preg-nancies. Women who had gestational diabetes usually aretested for diabetes at the post-partum checkup or afterstopping breastfeeding.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to actually prevent diabetes,\nparticularly since gestational diabetes is due to theeffects of normal hormones of pregnancy. However, theeffects of insulin resistance can be best handled throughcareful attention to diet, avoiding becoming overweightthroughout life, and participating in reasonable exercise.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFerris, Thomas F. “Gestational Diabetes.” In Harrison’s Princi-\nples of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "GI bleeding studies",
    "content": "GI bleeding studies\nDefinition\nGI bleeding studies uses radioactive materials in the\ninvestigation of bleeding from the gastrointestinal (GI)tract. These studies go under various names such as “GIbleeding scans” or “Tagged red blood cell scans.” Theyare performed and interpreted by radiologists (physicianswho specialize in diagnosis and treatment of diseases bymeans of x rays or related substances).\nPurpose\nThese studies are designed to find the source of blood\nloss from the GI tract; that is the stomach, small bowel, orcolon. They work best when bleeding is either too slow,intermittent, or too rapid to be identified by other means,such as endoscopy, upper GI series, or barium enema .\nThey are particularly useful when other methods\nhave not been able to determine the site or cause ofbleeding.\nPrecautions\nBecause of the use of radioactive materials, these\nstudies are best avoided in pregnant patients. Anotherimportant relates to the interpretation of these tests,whether normal or abnormal. Since these studies are farfrom perfect, they can only be used as “guides” as to thecause or site of bleeding. In most instances, further stud-ies must be performed to confirm their findings.\nDescription\nBleeding scans are based on the accumulation of\nradioactive material as it exits from the vessels during ableeding episode. Blood is first withdrawn from thepatient. Then, the blood, along with a radioactive sub-stance is injected into a vein and over several hours scansmeasuring radioactivity are performed. The studies wereinitially reported to be very sensitive and accurate; how-ever, critical evaluation of these tests have shown them tobe less accurate than originally believed.Preparation\nNo preparation is needed for these tests. They are\noften done on an “emergency” basis.\nAftercare\nNo special care is needed after the exam.\nRisks\nBleeding scans are free of any risks or side-effects,\naside from the fact that they should best be avoided inpregnancy .\nNormal results\nA normal exam would fail to show any evidence of\naccumulation of radioactive material on the scan. How-ever, scans may be normal in as many as 70% of patientswho later turn out to have significant causes of bleeding.This is known as a false-negative result. A patient must\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1449GI bleeding studies\nA clay model of the human digestive system. (Custom Med-\nical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)be bleeding at the same time the scan is performed for it\nto be seen. Therefore, not finding evidence of a bleedingsource during the study, can be misleading.\nAbnormal results\nThe accumulation of radioactive material indicating\na “leakage” of blood from the vessels is abnormal. Thescan gives a rough, though not exact, guide as to thelocation of the bleeding. It can tell where the bleedingmay be, but usually not the cause. Thus, extreme cautionand skill is needed in interpreting these scans, and deci-sions involving surgery or other treatment should awaitmore definitive tests.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLane, Loren. “Radionuclide Scanning.” In Sleisenger & Ford-\ntran’s Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease , ed.

The per-formance of an exam using an endoscope isreferred by the general term endoscopy. Diagnosisthrough biopsies or other means and therapeuticprocedures can be done with these instruments.water, or through direct contact with the organism that\ncauses the disease, Giardia lamblia . Giardiasis is found\nthroughout the world and is a common cause of trav-eller’s diarrhea . In the United States it is a growing\nproblem, especially among children in childcare centers.\nDescription\nGiardia is one of the most common intestinal para-\nsites in the world, infecting as much as 20% of the entirepopulation of the earth. It is common in overcrowdeddeveloping countries with poor sanitation and a lack ofclean water. Recent tests have found Giardia in 7% of all\nstool samples tested nationwide, indicating that this dis-ease is much more widespread than was originallybelieved. It has been found not only in humans, but alsoin wild and domestic animals.\nGiardiasis is becoming a growing problem in the\nUnited States, where it affects three times more childrenthan adults. In recent years, giardiasis outbreaks havebeen common among people in schools or daycare cen-ters and at catered affairs and large public picnic areas.Children can easily pass on the infection by touchingcontaminated toys, changing tables, utensils, or their ownfeces, and then touching other people. For this reason,infection spreads quickly through a daycare center orinstitution for the developmentally disabled.\nUnfiltered streams or lakes that may be contaminated\nby human or animal wastes are a common source ofinfection. Outbreaks can occur among campers and hikerswho drink untreated water from mountain streams. While20 million Americans drink unfiltered city water fromstreams or rivers, giardiasis outbreaks from tainted citywater have been rare. Most of these problems haveoccurred not due to the absence of filters, but because ofmalfunctions in city water treatment plants, such as a tem-porary drop in chlorine levels. It is possible to becomeinfected in a public swimming pool, however, since Giar-\ndiacan survive in chlorinated water for about 15 minutes.\nDuring that time, it is possible for an individual to swal-low contaminated pool water and become infected.\nCauses and symptoms\nGiardiasis is spread by food or water contaminated by\nthe Giardia lamblia protozoan organism found in the\nhuman intestinal tract and feces. When the cysts are ingest-ed, the stomach acid degrades the cysts and releases theactive parasite into the body. Once within the body, the par-asites cling to the lining of the small intestine, reproduce,and are swept into the fecal stream. As the liquid content ofthe bowel dries up, the parasites form cysts, which are thenpassed in the feces. Once excreted, the cysts can survive inwater for more than three months. The parasite is spread\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1450Giardiasisfurther by direct fecal-oral contamination, such as can\noccur if food is prepared without adequate hand-washing,or by ingesting the cysts in water or food.\nGiardiasis is not fatal, and about two-thirds of\ninfected people exhibit no symptoms. Symptoms will notoccur until between one and two weeks after infection.When present, symptoms include explosive, watery diar-rhea that can last for a week or more and, in chroniccases, may persist for months. Because the infectioninterferes with the body’s ability to absorb fats from theintestinal tract, the stool is filled with fat. Other symp-toms include foul-smelling and greasy feces, stomachpains, gas and bloating, loss of appetite, nausea and\nvomiting . In cases in which the infection becomeschron-\nic, lasting for months or years, symptoms might includepoor digestion, problems digesting milk, intermittentdiarrhea, fatigue , weakness, and significant weight loss.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis can be difficult because it can be easy to\noverlook the presence of the giardia cysts during a routineinspection of a stool specimen. In the past, the conditionhas been diagnosed by examining three stool samples forthe presence of the parasites. However, because theorganism is shed in some stool samples and not others,the infection may not be discovered using this method.\nA newer, more accurate method of diagnosing the\ncondition is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) that detects cysts and antigen in stool, and isapproximately 90% accurate. While slightly more expen-sive, it only needs to be done once and is therefore lessexpensive overall than the earlier test.\nTreatment\nAcute giardiasis can usually be allowed to run its\nnatural course and tends to clear up on its own. Antibi-\notics are helpful, however, in easing symptoms and pre-\nventing the spread of infection. Medications includemetronidazole, furazolidone and paromomycin. Healthycarriers with no symptoms do not need antibiotic treat-ment. If treatment should fail, the patient should wait twoweeks and repeat the drug course. Anyone with animpaired immune system (immunocompromised), suchas a person with AIDS , may need to be treated with a\ncombination of medications.\nPrognosis\nGiardiasis is rarely fatal, and when treated promptly,\nantibiotics usually cure the infection. While most peoplerespond quickly to treatment, some have lingering symp-toms and suffer with diarrhea and cramps for long peri-ods, losing weight and not growing well. Those most at-\nrisk for a course like this are the elderly, people with aweakened immune system, malnourished children, andanyone with low stomach acid.\nPrevention\nThe best way to avoid giardiasis is to avoid drinking\nuntreated surface water, especially from mountainstreams. The condition also can be minimized by practic-ing the following preventive measures:\n• thoroughly washing hands before handling food\n• maintaining good personal cleanliness• boiling any untreated water for at least three minutes• properly disposing of fecal material\nChildren with severe diarrhea (and others who are\nunable to control their bowel habits) should be kept athome until the stool returns to normal. If an outbreakoccurs in a daycare center, the director should notify thelocal health department. Some local health departmentsrequire a follow-up stool testing to confirm that the per-son is no longer contagious.

    "title": "Ginkgo biloba",
    "content": "Ginkgo biloba\nDefinition\nGinkgo biloba , known as the maidenhair tree, is one\nof the oldest trees on Earth, once part of the flora of theMesozoic period. The ginkgo tree is the only survivingspecies of the Ginkgoaceae family. This ancient decidu-ous tree may live for thousands of years. Ginkgo isindigenous to China, Japan, and Korea, but also thrivedin North America and Europe prior to the Ice Age. Thisdrastic climate change destroyed the wild ginkgo treethroughout much of the world. In China, ginkgo was cul-tivated in temple gardens as a sacred tree known as bai\ngou, thus assuring its survival there for over 200 million\nyears. Ginkgo fossils found from the Permian period areidentical to the living tree, which is sometimes called aliving fossil.\nDescription\nGinkgo trees may grow to 122 ft (37.2 m) tall and\nmeasure 4 ft (1.2 m) in girth. The female trees have asomewhat pointed shape at the top, like a pyramid. Themale trees are broader at the crown. The bark of the orna-mental ginkgo tree is rough and fissured and may be anash to dark-brown in color. Distinctive, fan-shaped leaveswith long stalks emerge from a sheath on the stem.Leaves are bright green in spring and summer, and turn togolden yellow in the fall. Ginkgo trees may take as longas 30 years to flower. Ginkgo is dioecious, with male andfemale flowers blooming on separate trees. Blossomsgrow singly from the axils of the leaf. The female flowers\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1452Ginkgo bilobaappear at the end of a leafless branch. The yellow, plum-\nshaped fruits develop an unpleasant scent as they ripen.They contain an edible inner seed that is available inAsian country marketplaces. Ginkgo’s longevity may bedue, in part, to its remarkable resistance to disease, pollu-tion, and insect damage. Ginkgo trees are part of the land-scape plan in many urban areas throughout the world.Millions of ginkgo trees, grown for harvest of the medici-nal leaves, are raised on plantations in the United States,France, South Korea, and Japan, and are exported toEurope for pharmaceutical processing.\nPurpose\nGinkgo leaves, fresh or dry, and seeds, separated\nfrom the outer layer of the fruit, are used medicinally.Ginkgo has remarkable healing virtues that have beenrecorded as far back as 2800 \nB.C. in the oldest Chinese\nmateria medica. Ginkgo seeds were traditionally servedto guests along with alcohol drinks in Japan. An enzymepresent in the ginkgo seed has been shown in clinicalresearch to speed up alcohol metabolism in the body,underscoring the wisdom of this folk custom. The leafextract has been used in Asia for thousands of years totreat allergies ,asthma , and bronchitis . It is also valued\nin Chinese medicine as a heart tonic, helpful in the treat-ment of cardiac arrhythmia. Ginkgo was first introducedto Europe in 1730, and to North America in 1784 whereit was planted as an exotic garden ornamental nearPhiladelphia. Ginkgo medicinal extracts are the primaryprescription medicines used in France and Germany.\nGinkgo acts to increase blood flow throughout the\nbody, particularly cerebral blood flow. It acts as a circu-latory system tonic, stimulating greater tone in thevenous system. The herb is a useful and proven remedyfor numerous diseases caused by restricted blood flow.European physicians prescribe the extract for treatmentof Raynaud’s disease , a condition of impaired circula-\ntion to the fingers. It is also recommended to treat inter-mittent claudication, a circulatory condition that resultsin painful cramping of the calf muscles in the leg andimpairs the ability to walk. German herbalists recom-mend ingesting the extract for treatment of leg ulcers,and large doses are used to treat varicose veins . Ginkgo\nis widely recommended in Europe for the treatment ofstroke . The dried leaf extract may also act to prevent\nhemmorrhagic stroke by strengthening the blood capil-laries throughout the body. In studies of patients withatherosclerotic clogging of the penile artery, long-termtherapy with ginkgo extract has provided significantimprovement in erectile function. Ginkgo extract alsoacts to eliminate damaging free-radicals in the body, andhas been shown to be effective in treatment of premen-\nstrual syndrome , relieving tender or painful breasts.Ginkgo extract has proven benefits to elderly per-\nsons. This ancient herb acts to enhance oxygen utiliza-tion and thus improves memory, concentration, and othermental faculties. The herbal extract is used to treatAlzheimer’s disease . It has been shown to have benefi-\ncial effect on the hippocampus, an area of the brainaffected by Alzheimer’s disease. The herbal extract hasalso been shown to significantly improve long-distancevision and may reverse damage to the retina of the eye.Studies have also confirmed its value in the treatment ofdepression in elderly persons. The ginkgo extract mayprovide relief for persons with headache ,sinusitis , and\nvertigo. It may also help relieve chronic ringing in theears known as tinnitus .\nThe active constituents in the ginkgo tree, known as\nginkgolides, interfere with a blood protein known as theplatelet activating factor, or PAF. Other phytochemicalsin ginkgo include flavonoids, biflavonoides, proantho-cyanidins, trilactonic diterpenes (including theginkgolides A, B, C, and M), and bilabolide, a trilactonicsesquiterpene. The therapeutic effects of this herb havenot been attributed to a single chemical constituent;rather, the medicinal benefits are due to the synergybetween the various chemical constituents. The standard-ized extract of ginkgo must be taken consistently to beeffective. A period of at least 12 weeks of use may berequired before the beneficial results are evident.\nPreparations\nGinkgo’s active principles are dilute in the leaves.\nThe herb must be processed to extract the active phyto-chemicals before it is medicinally useful. It would takean estimated 50 fresh ginkgo leaves to yield one standarddose of the extract. Dry extracts of the leaf, standardizedto a potency of 24% flavone glycosides and 6% terpenes,are commercially available. A standard dose is 40 mg,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1453Ginkgo biloba\nGinkgo biloba leaves. (Photograph by Robert J. Huffman. Field\nMark Publications. Reproduced by permission.)three times daily, though dosages as high as 240 mg daily\nare sometimes indicated.\nGinkgo extracts are widely used in Europe where\nthey are sold in prescription form or over the counter asan approved drug. This is not the case in the UnitedStates, where ginkgo extract is sold as a food supplementin tablet and capsule form.\nPrecautions\nGinkgo is generally safe and non-toxic in therapeu-\ntic dosages. Exceeding a daily dose of 240 mg of thedried extract may result in restlessness, diarrhea , and\nmild gastrointestinal disorders. Those on anticoagulantsshould have their doctor adjust their dose or should avoidginkgo in order to avoid over-thinning their blood andhemorrhaging. Ginkgo should be avoided two daysbefore and one to two weeks after surgery to avoid bleed-ing complications.\nSide effects\nSevere allergic skin reactions, similar to those\ncaused by poison ivy, have been reported after contactwith the fruit pulp of ginkgo. Eating even a small amountof the fruit has caused severe gastrointestinal irritation insome persons. People with persistent headaches shouldstop taking ginkgo. Some patients on medications fornervous system disease should avoid ginkgo. It can inter-act with some other medicines, but clinical informationis still emerging.\nInteractions\nThe chemically active ginkgolides present in the\nextract, specifically the ginkgolide B component, act toreduce the clotting time of blood and may interact withantithrombotic medicines, including aspirin .\nResources\nBOOKS\nDuke, James A., Ph.D. The Green Pharmacy.

    "title": "Ginseng, Korean",
    "content": "Ginseng, Korean\nDefinition\nKorean ginseng is one of the most widely used and\nacclaimed herbs in the world. Its scientific name is Panax\nginseng , which is the species from which Chinese, Kore-\nan, red, and white ginseng are produced. Chinese andKorean ginseng are the same plant cultivated in differentregions, and have slightly different properties accordingto Chinese medicine. White ginseng is simply the driedor powdered root of Korean ginseng, while red ginseng isthe same root that is steamed and dried in heat or sun-light. Red ginseng is said to be slightly stronger andmore stimulating in the body than white, according toChinese herbalism.\nDescription\nKorean ginseng has had a long and illustrious histo-\nry as an herb for health, and has been used for thousandsof years throughout the Orient as a medicine and tonic.Early Chinese medicine texts written in the first century\nA.D. mention ginseng, and ginseng has long been classi-\nfied by Chinese medicine as a “superior” herb. Thismeans it is said to promote longevity and vitality. Leg-ends around the world have touted ginseng as an aphro-disiac and sexual tonic. Researchers have found a slightconnection between sex drive and consuming ginseng,although a direct link and the mechanism of action arestill researched and disputed.\nKorean ginseng grows on moist, shaded mountain-\nsides in China, Korea, and Russia. It is a perennial herbthat reaches heights of two or more feet, and is distin-guished by its dark green leaves and red clusters ofberries. The root of the plant is the part valued for itsmedicinal properties. The root is long and slender andsometimes resembles the shape of the human body.Asian legends claim that this “man-root” has magicalpowers for those lucky enough to afford or find it, andthe roots bearing the closest resemblance to the humanbody are still the most valuable ones. The word ren shen\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1454Ginseng, Koreanin Chinese means roughly “the essence of the earth in the\nshape of a man.”\nKorean ginseng has historically been one of the most\nexpensive of herbs, as it has been highly in demand inChina and the Far East for centuries. Wars have beenfought in Asia over lands where it grew wild. Wild Kore-an ginseng is now nearly extinct from many regions. Sin-gle roots of wild plants have recently been auctioned inChina and New York City for sums approaching $50,000.Most of the world’s supply of Korean ginseng is cultivat-ed by farmers in Korea and China.\nBecause of the number of herbs sold under the name\nof ginseng, there can be some confusion for the con-sumer. Korean ginseng is a member of the Araliaceae\nfamily of plants, which also includes closely relatedAmerican ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius ) and Siberian\nginseng ( Eleutherococcus senticosus ). Both American\nand Siberian ginseng are considered by Chinese herbal-ists to be different herbs than Korean ginseng, and aresaid to have different effects and healing properties in thebody. To add more confusion, there are eight herbs inChinese medicine which are sometimes called ginseng,including black ginseng, purple ginseng, and prince’sginseng, some of which are not at all botanically relatedto Panax ginseng , so consumers should choose ginseng\nproducts with awareness.\nPurpose\nThe word panax is formed from Greek roots mean-\ning “cure-all,” and Panax ginseng has long been consid-\nered to be one of the great healing and strengtheningherbs in natural medicine. Ginseng is classified as anadaptogen , which is a substance that helps the body\nadapt to stress and balance itself without causing major\nside effects. Korean ginseng is used as a tonic forimproving overall health and stamina, and Chineseherbalists particularly recommend it for the ill, weak, orelderly. Korean ginseng has long been asserted to havelongevity, anti-senility, and memory improvement effectsin the aged population. As it helps the body to adapt tostress, athletes may use ginseng as herbal support duringrigorous training. Korean ginseng generally increasesphysical and mental energy. It is a good tonic for theadrenal glands, and is used by those suffering fromexhaustion, burnout, or debilitation from chronic illness.\nTraditional Chinese medicine also prescribes\nKorean ginseng to treat diabetes, and research has shownthat it enhances the release of insulin from the pancreasand lowers blood sugar levels. Korean ginseng has beendemonstrated to lower blood cholesterol levels. It has\nalso been shown to have antioxidant effects and toincrease immune system activity, which makes it a goodherbal support for those suffering from cancer and AIDS\nand other chronic conditions that impair the immune sys-tem. Further uses of Korean ginseng in Chinese medicineinclude treatment of impotence ,asthma , and digestive\nweakness.\nResearch\nScientists have isolated what they believe are the pri-\nmary active ingredients in ginseng, chemicals termedsaponin triterpenoid glycosides , or commonly called\nginsenocides . There are nearly 30 ginsenocides in Kore-\nan ginseng. Much research on Korean ginseng has beenconducted in China, but controlled human experimentswith it have not been easily accessible to the English-speaking world. Recent research in China was summa-rized by Dr. C. Lui in the February 1992 issue of theJournal of Ethnopharmacology , where he wrote that\nPanax ginseng was found to contain 28 ginsenocides that\n“act on the central nervous system, cardiovascular sys-tem and endocrine secretion, promote immune function,and have effects on anti-aging and relieving stress.”\nTo summarize other research, Korean ginseng has\nbeen shown in studies to have significant effects for thefollowing.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1455Ginseng, Korean\nDried Korean ginseng. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-\nduced by permission.)• Physical improvement and performance enhancement\nfor athletes: A study performed over three years in Ger-many showed athletes given ginseng had favorableimprovement in several categories over a control groupwho took a placebo. Another 1982 study showed thatathletes given ginseng had improved oxygen intake andfaster recovery time than those given placebos.\n• Mental performance improvement and mood enhance-\nment: In general, studies show that ginseng enhancesmental performance, learning time, and memory. Onestudy of sixteen volunteers showed improvement on awide variety of mental tests, including mathematics.Another study showed that those performing intricateand mentally demanding tasks improved performancewhen given Korean ginseng. Finally, a study has shownimprovement of mood in depression sufferers with the\nuse of ginseng.\n• Antifatigue and antistress actions: Patients with chronic\nfatigue who were given ginseng showed a statistically\nsignificant improvement in physical tests and in mentalattention and concentration, when compared with thosegiven placebos.\n• Lowering blood sugar: Animal studies have shown that\nginseng can facilitate the release of insulin from thepancreas and increase the number of insulin receptorsin the body.\n• Antioxidant properties: Scientific analysis of ginseng\nhas shown that it has antioxidant effects, similar to theeffects of vitamins A, C, and E. Thus, ginseng could bebeneficial in combating the negative effects of pollu-tion, radiation, and aging.\n• Cholesterol reduction: Some studies have shown that\nKorean ginseng reduces total cholesterol and increaseslevels of good cholesterol in the body.\n• Anticancer effects and immune system stimulation:\nSeveral tests have shown that Korean ginseng increasesimmune cell activity in the body, including the activityof T-cells and lymphocytes, which are instrumental infighting cancer and other immune system disorders likeAIDS. A Korean study indicates that taking ginsengmay reduce the chances of getting cancer, as a survey ofmore than 1,800 patients in a hospital in Seoul showedthat those who did not have cancer were more likely tohave taken ginseng regularly than those patients whohad contracted cancer.\n• Physical and mental improvement in the elderly: One\nstudy showed significant improvement in an elderly testgroup in visual and auditory reaction time and car-diopulmonary function when given controlled amountsof Korean ginseng. Korean ginseng has also beenshown to alleviate symptoms of menopause.• Impotence: Studies of human sexual function and Kore-\nan ginseng have been generally inconclusive, despitethe wide acclaim of ginseng as a sexual tonic. Testswith lab animals and ginseng have shown some inter-esting results, indicating that Korean ginseng promotesthe growth of male reproductive organs, increasessperm and testoterone levels, and increases sexualactivity in laboratory animals. In general, scientistsbelieve the link between ginseng and sex drive is due toginseng’s effect of strengthening overall health and bal-ancing the hormonal system.\nPreparations\nKorean ginseng can be purchased as whole roots,\npowder, liquid extracts, and tea. Roots should be slicedand boiled in water for up to 45 minutes to extract all thebeneficial nutrients. One to five grams of dry root is therecommended amount for one serving of tea. Herbalistsrecommend that ginseng not be boiled in metal pots, toprotect its antioxidant properties. Ginseng should betaken between meals for best assimilation.\nSome high quality Korean ginseng extracts and\nproducts are standardized to contain a specified amountof ginsenosides. The recommended dosage for extractscontaining four to eight percent of ginsenosides is 100mg once or twice daily. The recommended dosage fornon-standardized root powder or extracts is 1–2 g daily,taken in capsules or as a tea. It is recommended that gin-seng be taken in cycles and not continuously; after eachweek of taking ginseng, a few days without ingesting theherb should be observed. Likewise, Korean ginsengshould not be taken longer than two months at a time,after which one month’s rest period should be allowedbefore resuming the cycle again. Chinese herbalists rec-ommend that ginseng be taken primarily in the autumnand winter months.\nPrecautions\nConsumers should be aware of the different kinds of\nginseng, and which type is best suited for them. RedKorean ginseng is considered stronger and more stimu-lating than white, wild ginseng is stronger than cultivat-ed, and Korean ginseng is generally believed to be slight-ly stronger than Chinese. Furthermore, American andSiberian ginseng have slightly different properties thanKorean ginseng, and consumers should make aninformed choice as to which herb is best suited for them.Chinese herbalists do not recommend Korean ginsengfor those people who have “heat” disorders in their bod-ies, such as ulcers, high blood pressure, tensionheadaches, and symptoms associated with high stresslevels. Korean ginseng is generally not recommended for\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1456Ginseng, Koreanthose with symptoms of nervousness, mental imbalance,\ninflammation, or fever . Korean ginseng is not recom-\nmended for pregnant or lactating women, and women ofchildbearing age should use ginseng sparingly, as somestudies imply that it can influence estrogen levels. Also,Chinese herbalists typically only prescribe ginseng toolder people or the weak, as they believe that youngerand stronger people do not benefit as much from it andginseng is “wasted on the young.”\nBecause of the number of and demand for ginseng\nproducts on the market, consumers should search for areputable brand, preferably with a standardized percent-age of active ingredients. To illustrate the mislabelingfound with some ginseng products, Consumer Reports\nmagazine analyzed ten nationally-distributed ginsengproducts in 1995. They found that several of them lackedsignificant amounts of ginsenocides, despite claims onthe packaging to the contrary. Ginseng fraud has led theAmerican Botanical Council, publisher of HerbalGram\nmagazine, to initiate the Ginseng Evaluation Program, acomprehensive study and standardization of ginsengproducts on the American market. This study and itslabeling standards are still under development, and con-sumers should watch for it.\nSide effects\nKorean ginseng acts as a slight stimulant in the\nbody, and in some cases can cause overstimulation, irri-tability, nervousness and insomnia , although strong side\neffects are generally rare. Taking too high a dosage ofginseng, or taking ginseng for too long without a break,can cause ginseng intoxication , for which symptoms\nmight include headaches, insomnia, seeing spots, dizzi-\nness, shortage of breath and gastrointestinal discomfort.\nLong term use may cause menstrual abnormalities andbreast tenderness in some women.\nInteractions\nThose taking hormonal drugs should use ginseng\nwith care. Ginseng should not be taken with caffeine or\nother stimulants as these may increase its stimulatoryeffects and cause uncomfortable side effects.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDuke, J.A.

    "title": "Glaucoma",
    "content": "Glaucoma\nDefinition\nGlaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by\ndamage to the optic nerve usually due to excessively highintraocular pressure (IOP).This increased pressure withinthe eye, if untreated can lead to optic nerve damage result-ing in progressive, permanent vision loss, starting withunnoticeable blind spots at the edges of the field of vision,progressing to tunnel vision, and then to blindness.\nDescription\nBetween two to three million people in the United\nStates have glaucoma, and 120,000 of those are legallyblind as a result. It is the leading cause of preventableblindness in the United States and the most frequentcause of blindness in African-Americans, who are atabout a three-fold higher risk of glaucoma than the restof the population. The risk of glaucoma increases dra-matically with age, but it can strike any age group, evennewborn infants and fetuses.\nGlaucoma can be classified into two categories:\nopen-angle glaucoma and narrow-angle glaucoma. Tounderstand what glaucoma is and what these terms mean,it is useful to understand eye structure.\nEyes are sphere-shaped. A tough, non-leaky protec-\ntive sheath (the sclera) covers the entire eye, except forthe clear cornea at the front and the optic nerve at theback. Light comes into the eye through the cornea, then\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1457Glaucomapasses through the lens, which focuses it onto the retina\n(the innermost surface at the back of the eye). The rodsand cones of the retina transform the light energy intoelectrical messages, which are transmitted to the brain bythe bundle of nerves known as the optic nerve.\nThe iris, the colored part of the eye shaped like a\nround picture frame, is between the dome-shaped corneaand the lens. It controls the amount of light that entersthe eye by opening and closing its central hole (pupil)like the diaphragm in a camera. The iris, cornea, and lensare bathed in a liquid called the aqueous humor, which issomewhat similar to plasma. This liquid is continuallyproduced by nearby ciliary tissues and moved out of theeye into the bloodstream by a system of drainage canals(called the trabecular meshwork). The drainage area islocated in front of the iris, in the angle formed betweenthe iris and the point at which the iris appears to meet theinside of the cornea.\nGlaucoma occurs if the aqueous humor is not\nremoved rapidly enough or if it is made too rapidly, caus-ing pressure to build-up. The high pressure distorts theshape of the optic nerve and destroys the nerve. Destroyednerve cells result in blind spots in places where the imagefrom the retina is not being transmitted to the brain.\nOpen-angle glaucoma accounts for over 90% of all\ncases. It is called “open-angle” because the angle betweenthe iris and the cornea is open, allowing drainage of theaqueous humor. It is usually chronic and progresses slow-ly. In narrow-angle glaucoma, the angle where aqueousfluid drainage occurs is narrow, and therefore may drainslowly or may be at risk of becoming closed. A closed-angle glaucoma attack is usually acute, occurring whenthe drainage area is blocked. This can occur, for example,if the iris and lens suddenly adhere to each other and theiris is pushed forward. In patients with very narrowangles, this can occur when the eyes dilate (e.g., whenentering a dark room, or if taking certain medications).\nCongenital glaucoma occurs in babies and is the\nresult of incomplete development of the eye’s drainagecanals during embryonic development. Microsurgery canoften correct the defects or they can be treated with acombination of medicine and surgery.\nOne rare form of open-angle glaucoma, normal ten-\nsion glaucoma, is different. People with normal-tensionglaucoma have optic nerve damage in the presence ofnormal IOP. As of 1998, the mechanism of this disease isa mystery but is generally detected after an examinationof the optic nerve. Those at higher risk for this form ofglaucoma are people with a familial history of normaltension glaucoma, people of Japanese ancestory, andpeople with a history of systemic heart disease such asirregular heart rhythm.Glaucoma is also a secondary condition of over 60\nwidely diverse diseases and can also result from injury,inflammation, tumor, or in advanced cases of cataract ordiabetes.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThe cause of vision loss in all forms of glaucoma is\noptic nerve damage. There are many underlying causesand forms of glaucoma. Most causes of glaucoma are notknown, but it is clear that a number of different processesare involved, and a malfunction in any one of them couldcause glaucoma. For example, trauma to the eye couldresult in the angle becoming blocked, or, as a personages, the lens becomes larger and may push the iris for-ward. The cause of optic nerve damage in normal-tensionglaucoma is also unknown, but there is speculation thatthe optic nerves of these patients are susceptible to dam-age at lower pressures than what is usually considered tobe abnormally high.\nIt is probable that most glaucoma is inherited. At\nleast ten defective genes that cause glaucoma have beenidentified.\nSymptoms\nAt first, chronic open-angle glaucoma is without\nnoticeable symptoms. The pressure build-up is gradualand there is no discomfort. Moreover, the vision loss istoo gradual to be noticed and each eye fills-in the imagewhere its partner has a blind spot. However, if it is nottreated, vision loss becomes evident, and the conditioncan be very painful.\nOn the other hand, acute closed-angle glaucoma is\nobvious from the beginning of an attack. The symptomsare, blurred vision, severe pain , sensitivity to light, nau-\nsea, and halos around lights. The normally clear corneasmay be hazy. This is an ocular emergency and needs tobe treated immediately.\nSimilarly, congenital glaucoma is evident at birth.\nSymptoms are bulging eyes, cloudy corneas, excessivetearing, and sensitivity to light.\nDiagnosis\nIntraocular pressure, visual field defects, the angle in\nthe eye where the iris meets the cornea, and the appear-ance of the optic nerve are all considered in the diagnosisof glaucoma. IOP is measured with an instrument knownas a tonometer. One type of tonometer involves numbingthe eye with an eyedrop that has a yellow coloring in itand touching the cornea with a small probe. This quick\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1458Glaucomatest is a routine part of an eye examination and is usually\nincluded without extra charge in the cost of a visit to anophthalmologist or optometrist.\nOphthalmoscopes, hand-held instruments with a\nlight source, are used to detect optic nerve damage bylooking through the pupil. The optic nerve is examinedfor changes; the remainder of the back of the eye can beexamined as well. Other types of lenses that can be usedto examine the back of the eye may also be used. A slitlamp will allow the doctor to examine the front of the eye(i.e., cornea, iris, and lens).\nVisual field tests (perimetry) can detect blind spots\nin a patient’s field of vision before the patient is aware ofthem. Certain defects may indicate glaucoma.\nAnother test, gonioscopy, can distinguish between\nnarrow-angle and open-angle glaucoma. A gonioscope,which is a hand-held contact lens with a mirror, allowsvisualization of the angle between the iris and the cornea.\nIntraocular pressure can vary throughout the day. For\nthat reason, the doctor may have a patient return for sever-al visits to measure the IOP at different times of the day.\nTreatment\nMedications\nWhen glaucoma is diagnosed, drugs, typically given\nas eye drops, are usually tried before surgery. Severalclasses of medications are effective at lowering IOP andthus preventing optic nerve damage in chronic andneonatal glaucoma. Beta blockers , like Timoptic; car-\nbonic anhydrase inhibitors, like acetazolamide; andalpha-2 agonists, such as Alphagan, inhibit the produc-tion of aqueous humor. Miotics, like pilocarpine, andprostaglandin analogues, like Xalatan, increase the out-flow of aqueous humor. Cosopt is the first eyedrop that isa combined beta blocker (Timoptic) and carbonic anhy-drase inhibitor and may be helpful for patients requiredto take more than one glaucoma medication each day.The Food and drug administration recently approved twonew prostaglandin-related drugs, Travatan and Lumiganon March 16, 2001. These drugs work by decreasingintraocular pressure and may be considered for peoplewith glaucoma that are unable to tolerate other IOP low-ering drugs. Additionally, Travatan may work best forAfrican-Americans with glaucoma (a population at highrisk for glaucoma).\nIt is important for patients to tell their doctors about\nany conditions they have or medications they are taking.Certain drugs used to treat glaucoma should not be pre-scribed for patients with pre-existing conditions. All ofthese drugs mentioned above have side effects, some ofwhich are rare but serious and potentially life-threaten-ing, so patients taking them should be monitored closely,\nespecially for cardiovascular, pulmonary, and behavioralsymptoms. Different medications lower IOP by differentamounts, and a combination of medications may be nec-essary. It is important that patients take their medicationsand that their regimens are monitored regularly, to besure that the IOP is lowered sufficiently. IOP should bemeasured three to four times per year.\nAs of 1998, normal-tension glaucoma is treated in\nthe same way as chronic high-intraocular-pressure glau-coma. This reduces IOP to less-than-normal levels, on thetheory that overly susceptible optic nerves are less likelyto be damaged at lower pressures. Research underwaymay point to better treatments for this form of glaucoma.\nAttacks of acute closed-angle glaucoma are medical\nemergencies. IOP is rapidly lowered by successivedeployment of acetazolamide, hyperosmotic agents, atopical beta-blocker, and pilocarpine. Epinephrine shouldnot be used because it exacerbates angle closure.\nSurgery\nThere are several types of laser surgery used to treat\nglaucoma. Laser peripheral iridotomy makes an openingin the iris allowing the fluid to drain, argon laser trabecu-loplasty is aimed at the fluid channel opening to help thedrainage system function and laser cyclophotocoagula-tion is used to decrease the amount of fluid made. Micro-surgery, also called “filtering surgery” has been used inmany different types of glaucoma. A new opening is cre-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1459Glaucoma\nA close-up view of an inflamed eye with acute glaucoma\nand an irregularly enlarged pupil. (Custom Medical Stock\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)ated in the sclera allowing the intraocular fluid to bypass\nthe blocked drainage canals.

However, marijuana has serious side effectsand contains carcinogens, and any IOP-lowering med-ication must be taken continually to avoid optic nervedamage. Although the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) currentlyrecommend against treating glaucoma with marijuana,they are supporting research to learn more about it andto determine the feasibility of separating the compo-nents that lower IOP from components that produce sideeffects and carcinogens.\nAny glaucoma patient using alternative methods to\nattempt to prevent optic nerve damage should also beunder the care of a traditionally trained ophthalmologistor optometrist who is licensed to treat glaucoma, so thatIOP and optic nerve damage can be monitored.\nPrognosis\nAbout half of the people stricken by glaucoma are\nnot aware of it. For them, the prognosis is not good, andmany of them will become blind. Sight lost due to glau-coma cannot be restored. On the other hand, the progno-sis for treated glaucoma is excellent.\nPrevention\nBecause glaucoma may not initially result in symp-\ntoms, the best form of prevention is to have regular eyeexams.\nPatients with narrow angles should avoid certain\nmedications (even over-the-counter medications, suchas some cold or allergy medications).Any person who isglaucoma-susceptible (i.e. narrow angles and borderlineIOPs) should read the warning labels on over-the-counter medicines and inform their physicians of prod-ucts they are considering taking.Steroids may also raiseIOP, so patients may need to be monitored more fre-quently if it is necessary to use steroids for anothermedical condition.\nNot enough is known about the underlying mecha-\nnisms of glaucoma to prevent the disease itself. Howev-er, prevention of optic nerve damage from glaucoma isessential and can be effectively accomplished when thecondition is diagnosed and treated. As more is learnedabout the genes that cause glaucoma, it will becomepossible to test DNA and identify potential glaucomavictims, so they can be treated even before their IOPbecomes elevated.Resources\nBOOKS\nEpstein, David L., R.

    "content": "Glomerulonephritis\nDefinition\nAcute glomerulonephritis is an inflammatory disease\nof both kidneys predominantly affecting children fromages two to 12. Chronic glomerulonephritis can developover a period of 10–20 years and is most often associatedwith other systemic disease, including diabetes, malaria ,\nhepatitis, or systemic lupus erythematosus .\nDescription\nAcute glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the\nglomeruli, bundles of tiny vessels inside the kidneys. Thedamaged glomeruli cannot effectively filter waste prod-ucts and excess water from the bloodstream to makeurine. The kidneys appear enlarged, fatty, and congested.\nCauses and symptoms\nAcute glomerulonephritis most often follows a\nstreptococcal infection of the throat or skin. In children,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1461Glomerulonephritisit is most often associated with an upper respiratory\ninfection, tonsillitis , or scarlet fever . Kidney symptoms\nusually begin two to three weeks after the initial infec-tion. Exposure to certain paints, glue or other organicsolvents may also be the causative agent. It is thoughtthat the kidney is damaged with exposure to the toxinsthat are excreted into the urine.\nMild glomerulonephritis may produce no symptoms,\nand diagnosis is made with laboratory studies of theurine and blood. Individuals with more severe cases ofthe disease may exhibit:\n• fatigue\n• nausea and vomiting• shortness of breath• disturbed vision\n• high blood pressure\n• swelling, especially noted in the face, hands, feet, and\nankles\n• blood and protein in the urine, resulting in a smoky or\nslightly red appearance\nThe individual with chronic glomerulonephritis may\ndiscover their condition with a routine physical examrevealing high blood pressure, or an eye exam showingvascular or hemorrhagic changes. The kidneys may bereduced to as little as one-fifth their normal size, consist-ing largely of fibrous tissues.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of glomerulonephritis is established based\non medical history, combined with laboratory studies. A“dipstick” test of urine will reveal increased protein levels.A 24 hour urine collection allows measurement of theexcretion of proteins and creatinine. Creatinine clearancefrom the bloodstream by the kidneys is considered an\nindex of the glomerular filtration rate. Blood studies mayreveal a low blood count , and may also be checked for the\npresence of a streptococcal antibody titer(a sophisticatedblood test indicating presence of streptococcal infection).A kidney biopsy may also be performed, using ultrasound\nto guide the needle for obtaining the specimen.\nTreatment\nThe main objectives in the treatment of acute\nglomerulonephritis are to:\n• decrease the damage to the glomeruli• decrease the metabolic demands on the kidneys\n• improve kidney function\nBedrest helps in maintaining adequate blood flow to\nthe kidney. If residual infection is suspected, antibiotictherapy may be needed. In the presence of fluid overload,diuretics may be used to increase output with urination.\nIron and vitamin supplements may be ordered if anemiadevelops, and antihypertensives, if high blood pressureaccompanies the illness. In order to rest the kidney dur-ing the acute phase, decreased sodium and protein intakemay be recommended. The amount of protein allowed isdependent upon the amount lost in the urine, and therequirements of the individual patient. Sodium limita-tions depend on the amount of edema present. Fluid\nrestrictions are adjusted according to the patient’s urinaryoutput and body weight.\nAn accurate daily record of the patient’s weight,\nfluid intake and urinary output assist in estimating kid-ney function. The patient must be watched for signs ofcomplications and recurrent infection. As edema isreduced and the urine becomes free of protein and redblood cells, the patient is allowed to increase activity. Awoman who has had glomerulonephritis requires specialmedical attention during pregnancy .\nPrognosis\nIn acute glomerulonephritis, symptoms usually sub-\nside in two weeks to several months, with 90% of childrenrecovering without complications and adults recoveringmore slowly. Chronic glomerulonephritis is a disease thattends to progress slowly, so that there are no symptomsuntil the kidneys can no longer function. The resultantrenal failure may require dialysis or kidney transplant.\nPrevention\nPrevention of glomerulonephritis is best accom-\nplished by avoiding upper respiratory infections, as well\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1462Glomerulonephritis\nA close-up view of glomerulonephritis affecting the kidney.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)as other acute and chronic infections, especially those of\na streptococcal origin. Cultures of the infection site, usu-ally the throat, should be obtained and antibiotic sensibil-ity of the offending organism determined. Prompt med-ical assessment for necessary antibiotic therapy shouldbe sought when infection is suspected. The use of pro-phylactic immunizations is recommended as appropriate.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBranch, William. Office Practice of Medicine. Philadelphia: W.\nB.

It can cause hemolytic anemia ,\nvarying in severity from life-long anemia, to rare boutsof anemia to total unawareness of the condition. Theepisodes of hemolytic anemia are usually triggered byoxidants, infection, or by eating fava beans.\nDescription\nG6PD deficiency is the most common enzyme defi-\nciency in the world, with about 400 million people livingwith it. It is most prevalent in people of African, Mediter-ranean, and Asian ancestry. The incidence in differentpopulations varies from zero in South American Indiansto less than 0.1% of Northern Europeans to about 50% ofKurdish males. In the United States, it is most commonamong African American males; about 11 to 14% areG6PD-deficient.\nG6PD deficiency is a recessive sex-linked trait.\nThus, males have only one copy of the G6PD gene, butfemales have two copies. Recessive genes are masked inthe presence of a gene that encodes normal G6PD.Accordingly, females with one copy of the gene forG6PD deficiency are usually normal, while males withone copy have the trait.\nG6PD is present in all human cells but is particularly\nimportant to red blood cells. It is required to make NADPHin red blood cells but not in other cells. It is also required tomake glutathione. Glutathione and NADPH both help pro-tect red blood cells against oxidative damage. Thus, whenG6PD is defective, oxidative damage to red blood cellsreadily occurs, and they break open as a result. This eventis called hemolysis, and multiple hemolyses in a short timespan constitute an episode of hemolytic anemia.\nAs of 1998, there are almost 100 different known\nforms of G6PD enzyme molecules encoded by defective\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1463Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencyG6PD genes, yet not one of them is completely inactive.\nThis suggests that G6PD is indispensable. Many G6PDdefective enzymes are deficient in their stability ratherthan their initial ability to function. Since red blood cellslack nuclei, they, unlike other cells, cannot synthesizenew enzyme molecules to replace defective ones. Hence,we expect young red blood cells to have new, functionalG6PD and older cells to have non-functioning G6PD.This explains why episodes of hemolytic anemia are fre-quently self-limiting; new red blood cells are generatedwith enzymes able to afford protection from oxidation.\nThe geographic distribution of G6PD deficiency,\nallowing for migration, coincides with the geographicdistribution of malaria . This fact and survival statistics\nsuggest that G6PD deficiency protects against malaria.\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is\nalso known as G6PD deficiency, favism, and primaquinesensitivity.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nG6PD deficiency is caused by one copy of a defective\nG6PD gene in males or two copies of a defective G6PDgene in females. Hemolytic anemic attacks can be causedby oxidants, infection, and or by eating fava beans.\nSymptoms\nThe most significant consequence of this disorder is\nhemolytic anemia, which is usually episodic, but theKEY TERMS\nBilirubin —A breakdown product derived from\nhemoglobin; removed from the blood by the liver.\nEnzyme —A protein catalyst; one of the two kinds of\nbiological catalysts, which are exceedingly specific;each different enzyme only catalyzes one or twospecific reactions.\nEnzyme activity —A measure of the ability of an\nenzyme to catalyze a specific reaction.\nGlutathione —A molecule that acts as a co-enzyme\nin cellular oxidation-reduction reactions.\nHemolysis —Lysis (opening) of red blood cells, with\nconcomitant leakage of cell contents from the cells.\nHemolytic anemia —Anemia due to hemolysis.\nJaundice —Yellowish skin color due to liver disease.Neonatal —Describes babies just after they are born.\nRecessive trait —An inherited trait that is outwardly\nobvious only when two copies of the gene for thattrait are present—as opposed to a dominant traitwhere one copy of the gene for the dominant trait issufficient to display the trait. The recessive condi-tion is said to be masked by the presence of thedominant gene when both are present; i.e., therecessive condition is seen only in the absence ofthe dominant gene.\nSex-linked —Refers to genes or traits carried on one\nof the sex chromosomes, usually the X.\nX chromosome —One of the two types of sex chro-\nmosomes, present twice in female cells and once inmale cells.\nvast majority of people with G6PD deficiency have no\nsymptoms.\nThe many different forms of G6PD deficiency have\nbeen divided into five classes according to severity.\n• Class 1—enzyme deficiency with chronic hemolytic\nanemia\n• Class 2—severe enzyme deficiency with less than 10%\nof normal activity\n• Class 3—moderate to mild enzyme deficiency with\n10–60% of normal activity\n• Class 4—very mild or no enzyme deficiency\n• Class 5—increased enzyme activity Fortunately, only a\nsmall number of people fall into Class 1.\nThe major symptoms of hemolytic anemia are jaun-\ndice, dark urine, abdominal pain , back pain, lowered red\nblood cell count, and elevated bilirubin. People who suf-fer from severe and chronic forms of G6PD deficiency inaddition may have gallstones , enlarged spleens, defec-\ntive white blood cells, and cataracts .\nAttacks of hemolytic anemia are serious for infants.\nBrain damage and death are possible but preventable\noutcomes. Newborns with G6PD deficiency are about1.5 times as likely to get neonatal jaundice than new-\nborns without G6PD deficiency.\nDiagnosis\nBlood tests can detect G6PD deficiency, either by\nmeasuring the G6PD enzyme activity between episodes\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1464Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencyor by measuring bilirubin during an episode. Such tests\ncost about $50.00. Family histories are helpful, too.\nTreatment\nIn a typical attack of hemolytic anemia, no treatment\nis needed; the patient will recover in about eight days.However, blood transfusions are necessary in severecases. Recent success treating elevated bilirubin in new-borns by exposing them to bright light has decreased theneed for neonatal transfusions.\nAlternative treatment\nVitamin E and folic acid (both anti-oxidants) may\nhelp decrease hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for almost everyone with G6PD defi-\nciency is excellent. Large studies have shown that G6PD-deficient individuals do not acquire any illnesses morefrequently than the rest of the population. In fact theopposite may be true for some diseases like ischemicheart disease and cerebrovascular disease.\nPrevention\nMost episodes of hemolytic anemia can be prevented\nby avoiding fava beans, oxidant drugs, and oxidant chem-icals. All of the following oxidants can trigger attacks:acetanilid, dapsone, doxorubicin, furazolidone, methyl-ene blue, nalidixic acid, napthalene, niridazole, nitrofu-rantoin, phenazopyridine, phenylhydrazine, primaquine,quinidine, quinine, sulfacetamide, sulfamethoxazole, sul-fonamide, sulfapyridine, thiazolesulfone, toluidine blue,and trinitrotoluene. Since infections also trigger hemolyt-ic attacks and have other dire consequences, sometimes itis advisable to use one of the listed drugs.\nIt is especially important to screen newborns who\nare likely to have G6PD deficiency to ensure that G6PD-deficient babies won’t be subjected to any of the triggersof hemolytic anemia. Pregnant women, especially inareas where G6PD deficiency is prevalent, should avoideating fava beans.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLuzzatto, Lucio, and Atul Mehta. “Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehy-\ndrogenase Deficiency.” In The Metabolic and Molecular\nBases of Inherited Disease. 7th ed.

    "title": "Glycogen storage diseases",
    "content": "Glycogen storage diseases\nDefinition\nGlycogen serves as the primary fuel reserve for the\nbody’s energy needs. Glycogen storage diseases, alsoknown as glycogenoses, are genetically linked metabolicdisorders that involve the enzymes regulating glycogenmetabolism. Symptoms vary by the glycogen storage dis-ease (GSD) type and can include muscle cramps andwasting, enlarged liver, and low blood sugar. Disruptionof glycogen metabolism also affects other biochemicalpathways as the body seeks alternative fuel sources.Accumulation of abnormal metabolic by-products candamage the kidneys and other organs. GSD can be fatal,but the risk hinges on the type of GSD.\nDescription\nMost of the body’s cells rely on glucose as an energy\nsource. Glucose levels in the blood are very stringentlycontrolled within a range or 70–100 mg/dL, primarily byhormones such as insulin and glucagon. Immediatelyafter a meal, blood glucose levels rise and exceed thebody’s immediate energy requirements. In a processanalogous to putting money in the bank, the body bun-dles up the extra glucose and stores it as glycogen in theliver and muscles. Later, as the blood glucose levelsbegin to dip, the body makes a withdrawal from itsglycogen savings.\nThe system for glycogen metabolism relies on a\ncomplex system of enzymes. These enzymes are respon-sible for creating glycogen from glucose, transportingthe glycogen to and from storage areas within cells, andextracting glucose from the glycogen as needed. Bothcreating and tearing down the glycogen macromoleculeare multistep processes requiring a different enzyme ateach step. If one of these enzymes is defective and failsto complete its step, the process halts. Such enzymedefects are the underlying cause of GSDs.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1465Glycogen storage diseasesThe enzyme defect arises from an error in its gene.\nSince the error is in the genetic code, GSDs can bepassed down from generation-to-generation. However,all but one GSD are linked to autosomal genes, whichmeans a person inherits one copy of the gene from eachparent. Following a Mendelian inheritance pattern, thenormal gene is dominant and the defective gene is reces-sive. As long as a child receives at least one normal gene,there is no risk for a GSD. GSDs appear only if a personinherits a defective gene from both parents.\nThe most common forms of GSD are Types I, II, III,\nand IV , which may account for more than 90% of allcases. The most common form is Type I, or von Gierke’sdisease, which occurs in one out of every 100,000 births.Other forms, such as Types VI and IX, are so rare thatreliable statistics are not available. The overall frequencyof all forms of glycogen storage disease is approximatelyone in 20,000–25,000 live births.\nCauses and symptoms\nGSD symptoms depend on the enzyme affected.\nSince glycogen storage occurs mainly in muscles and theliver, those sites display the most prominent symptoms.\nThere are at least 10 different types of GSDs which\nare classified according to the enzyme affected:\n• Type Ia, or von Gierke’s disease, is caused by glucose-\n6-phosphatase deficiency in the liver, kidney, and smallintestine. The last step in glycogenolysis, the breakingdown of glycogen to glucose, is the transformation ofglucose-6-phosphate to glucose. In GSD I, that stepdoes not occur. As a result, the liver is clogged withexcess glycogen and becomes enlarged and fatty. Othersymptoms include low blood sugar and elevated levelsof lactate, lipids, and uric acid in the blood. Growth isimpaired, puberty is often delayed, and bones may be\nweakened by osteoporosis . Blood platelets are also\naffected and frequent nosebleeds and easy bruising arecommon. Primary symptoms improve with age, butafter age 20–30, liver tumors, liver cancer , chronic\nrenal disease, and gout may appear.\n• Type Ib is caused by glucose-6-phosphatase translocase\ndeficiency. In order to carry out the final step ofglycogenolysis, glucose-6-phosphate has to be trans-ported into a cell’s endoplasmic reticulum. If translo-case, the enzyme responsible for that movement, ismissing or defective, the same symptoms occur as inType Ia. Additionally, the immune system is weakenedand victims are susceptible to bacterial infections, suchas pneumonia , mouth and gum infections, and inflam-\nmatory bowel disease. Types Ic and Id are also causedby defects in the translocase system.• Type II, or Pompe’s disease or acid maltase deficiency,\nis caused by lysosomal alpha-D-glucosidase deficiencyin skeletal and heart muscles. GSD II is subdividedaccording to the age of onset. In the infantile form,infants seem normal at birth, but within a few monthsthey develop muscle weakness, trouble breathing, andan enlarged heart. Cardiac failure and death usually\noccur before age 2, despite medical treatment. The juve-nile and adult forms of GSD II affect mainly the skeletalmuscles in the body’s limbs and torso. Unlike the infan-tile form, treatment can extend life, but there is no cure.Respiratory failure is the primary cause of death.\n• Type III, or Cori’s disease, is caused by glycogen\ndebrancher enzyme deficiency in the liver, muscles, andsome blood cells, such as leukocytes and erythrocytes.About 15% of GSD III cases only involve the liver. Theglycogen molecule is not a simple straight chain oflinked glucose molecules, but rather an intricate net-work of short chains that branch off from one another.In glycogenolysis, a particular enzyme is required tounlink the branch points. When that enzyme fails,symptoms similar to GSD I occur; in childhood, it maybe difficult to distinguish the two GSDs by symptomsalone. In addition to the low blood sugar, retardedgrowth, and enlarged liver causing a swollen abdomen,GSD III also causes muscles prone to wasting, anenlarged heart, and heightened levels of lipids in theblood. The muscle wasting increases with age, but theother symptoms become less severe.\n• Type IV , or Andersen’s disease, is caused by glycogen\nbrancher enzyme deficiency in the liver, brain, heart,skeletal muscles, and skin fibroblasts. The glycogenconstructed in GSD IV is abnormal and insoluble. As itaccumulates in the cells, cell death leads to organ dam-age. Infants born with GSD IV appear normal at birth,but are diagnosed with enlarged livers and failure to\nthrive within their first year. Infants who survive\nbeyond their first birthday develop cirrhosis of the liver\nby age 3–5 and die as a result of chronic liver failure.\n• Type V , or McArdle’s disease, is caused by glycogen\nphosphorylase deficiency in skeletal muscles. Undernormal circumstances, muscles cells rely on oxidationof fatty acids during rest or light activity. Moredemanding activity requires that they draw on theirglycogen stockpile. In GSD V , this form of glycogenol-ysis is disabled and glucose is not available. The mainsymptoms are muscle weakness and cramping broughton by exercise , as well as burgundy-colored urine after\nexercise due to myoglobin (a breakdown product ofmuscle) in the urine.\n• Type VI, or Hers’ disease, is caused by liver phosphory-\nlase deficiency, which blocks the first step of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1466Glycogen storage diseasesglycogenolysis. In contrast to other GSDs, Type VI\nseems to be linked to the X chromosome. Low bloodsugar is one of the key symptoms, but it is not as severeas in some other forms of GSD. An enlarged liver andmildly retarded growth also occur.\n• Type VII, or Tarui’s disease, is caused by muscle phos-\nphofructokinase deficiency. Although glucose may beavailable as a fuel in muscles, the cells cannot metabo-lize it. Therefore, abnormally high levels of glycogenare stockpiled in the muscle cells. The symptoms aresimilar to GSD V , but also include anemia andincreased levels of uric acid.\n• Types VIII and XI are caused by defects of enzymes in\nthe liver phosphorylase activating-deactivating cascadeand have symptoms similar to GSD VI.\n• Type IX is caused by liver glycogen phosphorylase\nkinase deficiency and, symptom-wise, is very similar toGSD VI. The main differences are that the symptomsmay not be as severe and may also include exercise-related problems in the muscles, such as pain and\ncramps. The symptoms abate after puberty with propertreatment. Most cases of GSD IX are linked to the Xchromosome and therefore affect males.\n• Type X is caused by a defect in the cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate-dependent (AMP) kinase enzyme andpresents symptoms similar to GSDs VI and IX.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis usually occurs in infancy or childhood,\nalthough some milder types of GSD go unnoticed wellinto adulthood and old age. It is even conceivable thatsome of the milder GSDs are never diagnosed.\nThe four major symptoms that typically lead a doc-\ntor to suspect GSDs are low blood sugar, enlarged liver,retarded growth, and an abnormal blood biochemistryprofile. A definitive diagnosis is obtained by biopsy ofthe affected organ or organs. The biopsy sample is testedfor its glycogen content and assayed for enzyme activity.There are DNA-based techniques for diagnosing someGSDs from more easily available samples, such as bloodor skin. These DNA techniques can also be used for pre-natal testing.\nTreatment\nSome GSD types cannot be treated, while others are\nrelatively easy to control through symptom management.In more severe cases, receiving an organ transplant is theonly option. In the most severe cases, there are no avail-able treatments and the victim dies within the first fewyears of life.Of the treatable types of GSD, many are treated by\nmanipulating the diet. The key to managing GSD I is tomaintain consistent levels of blood glucose through acombination of nocturnal intragastric feeding (usuallyfor infants and children), frequent high-carbohydratemeals during the day, and regular oral doses of corn-starch (people over age 2). Juvenile and adult forms ofGSD II can be managed somewhat by a high protein diet,which also helps in cases of GSD III, GSD VI, and GSDIX. GSD V and GSD VII can also be managed with ahigh protein diet and by avoiding strenuous exercise.\nFor GSD cases in which dietary therapy is ineffec-\ntive, organ transplantation may be the only viable alter-native. Liver transplants have been effective in reversingthe symptoms of GSD IV .\nAdvances in genetic therapy offer hope for effective\ntreatment in the future. This therapy involves using virus-es to deliver a correct form of the gene to affected cells.Another potential therapy utilizes transgenic animals toproduce correct copies of the defective enzyme in theirmilk. In late 1997, a Dutch pharmaceutical company,Pharming Health Care Products, began clinical trials totreat GSD II with human alpha-glucosidase derived fromthe milk of transgenic rabbits. Researchers at Duke Uni-versity in North Carolina are also focusing on a treatmentfor Pompe’s disease and, aided by Synpac Pharmaceuti-cals Limited of the United Kingdom, plan to begin clini-cal trials of a recombinant form of the enzyme in 1998.\nPrognosis\nPeople with well-managed, treatable types of GSD\ncan lead long, relatively normal lives. This goal isaccomplished with the milder types of GSD, such asTypes VI, IX, and X. As the GSD type becomes moresevere, a greater level of vigilance against infections andother complications is required. Given current treatmentoptions, complications such as liver disease, heart fail-\nure, and respiratory failure may not be warded-off indef-\ninitely. Quality of life and life expectancy are substantial-ly decreased.\nPrevention\nBecause GSD is an inherited condition, it is not pre-\nventable. If both parents carry the defective gene, there isa one-in-four chance that their offspring will inherit thedisorder. Other children may be carriers or they maymiss inheriting the gene altogether.\nThrough chorionic villi sampling and amniocentesis ,\nthe disorder can be detected prior to birth. Some types ofGSD can be detected even before conception occurs, ifboth parents are tested for the presence of the defective\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1467Glycogen storage diseasesgene. Before undergoing such testing, the prospective par-\nents should meet with a genetic counselor and other pro-fessionals in order to make an informed decision.\nResources\nBOOKS\nChen, Yuan-Tsong, and Ann Burchell. “Glycogen Storage Dis-\neases.” In The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherit-\ned Disease. 7th ed.

    "content": "Glycosylated hemoglobin test\nDefinition\nGlycosylated hemoglobin is a test that indicates how\nmuch sugar has been in a person’s blood during the pasttwo to four months. It is used to monitor the effective-ness of diabetes treatment.\nPurpose\nDiabetes is a disease in which a person cannot effec-\ntively use sugar in the blood. Left untreated, blood sugarlevels can be very high. High sugar levels increase risk ofcomplications, such as damage to eyes, kidneys, heart,nerves, blood vessels, and other organs.\nA routine blood sugar test reveals how close to nor-\nmal a sugar level is at the time of the test. The glycosylat-ed hemoglobin test reveals how close to normal it has\nbeen during the past several months.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1468Glycosylated hemoglobin testThis information helps a physician evaluate how\nwell a person is responding to diabetes treatment and todetermine how long sugar levels have been high in a per-son newly diagnosed with diabetes.\nDescription\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT) demonstrated that persons with diabetes whomaintained blood glucose (sugar) and total fasting hemo-\nglobin levels at or close to a normal range decreased theirrisk of complications by 50–75%. Based on results of thisstudy, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recom-mends routine glycosylated hemoglobin testing to mea-sure long-term control of blood sugar.\nGlycosylated hemoglobin measures the percentage\nof hemoglobin bound to glucose. Hemoglobin is a pro-tein found in every red blood cell. As hemoglobin andglucose are together in the red blood cell, the glucosegradually binds to the A1c form of hemoglobin in aprocess called glycosylation. The amount bound reflectshow much glucose has been in the blood during the pastaverage 120-day lifespan of red cells.\nSeveral methods are used to measure the amount of\nbound hemoglobin and glucose. They are electrophore-sis, chromatography, and immunoassay. All are based onthe separation of hemoglobin bound to glucose from thatwithout glucose.\nThe ADA recommends glycosylated hemoglobin be\ndone during a person’s first diabetes evaluation, againafter treatment is begun and sugar levels are stabilized,then repeated semiannually. If the person does not meettreatment goals or sugar levels have not stabilized, thetest should be repeated quarterly.\nOther names for the test include: Hemoglobin A1c,\nDiabetic control index, GHb, glycosylated hemoglobin,and glycated hemoglobin. The test is covered by insur-ance. Results are usually available the following day.\nPreparation\nA person does not need to fast before this test. A\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upperarm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and insertsa needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes. This test requires 5mL of blood.\nAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite, or the person may feel dizzy or faint.

    "title": "Goiter",
    "content": "Goiter\nDefinition\nGoiter refers to any visible enlargement of the thy-\nroid gland.\nDescription\nThe thyroid gland sits astride the trachea (windpipe)\nand is shaped like a butterfly. It makes thyroxin, a hormonethat regulates the metabolic activity of the body, rather likethe gas pedal on a car. Too much thyroxin increases themetabolism, causing weight loss, temperature elevation,nervousness, and irritability. Too little thyroxin slows themetabolism down, deepens the voice, causes weight gainand water retention, and retards growth and mental devel-opment in children. Both conditions also alter hair and skingrowth, bowel function, and menstrual flow.\nCuriously, the thyroid gland is often enlarged\nwhether it is making too much hormone, too little, orsometimes even when it is functioning normally. Thethyroid is controlled by the pituitary gland, whichsecretes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in responseto the amount of thyroxin it finds in the blood. TSHincreases the amount of thyroxin secreted by the thyroidand also causes the thyroid gland to grow.\n• Hyperthyroid goiter—If the amount of stimulating hor-\nmone is excessive, the thyroid will both enlarge andsecrete too much thyroxin. The result—hyperthy-roidism with a goiter. Graves’ disease is the most com-mon form of this disorder.\n• Euthyroid goiter—The thyroid is the only organ in the\nbody to use iodine. If dietary iodine is slightly inade-quate, too little thyroxin will be secreted, and the pitu-itary will sense the deficiency and produce more TSH.The thyroid gland will enlarge enough to make suffi-cient thyroxin.\n• Hypothyroid goiter—If dietary iodine is severely\nreduced, even an enlarged gland will not be able tomake enough thyroxin. The gland will keep growingunder the influence of TSH, but it may never be able tomake enough thyroxin.\nCauses and symptoms\nExcess TSH (or similar hormones), cysts, and\ntumors will enlarge the thyroid gland. Of these, TSHenlarges the entire gland while cysts and tumors enlargeonly a part of it.\nThe only symptom from a goiter is the large\nswelling just above the breast bone. Rarely, it may con-strict the trachea (windpipe) or esophagus and cause dif-ficulty breathing or swallowing. The rest of the symp-toms come from thyroxin or the lack of it.\nDiagnosis\nThe size, shape, and texture of the thyroid gland help\nthe physician determine the cause. A battery of blood\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1470Goitertests are required to verify the specific thyroid disease.\nFunctional imaging studies using radioactive iodinedetermine how active the gland is and what it looks like.\nTreatment\nGoiters of all types will regress with treatment of the\nunderlying condition. Dietary iodine may be all that isneeded. However, if an iodine deficient thyroid that hasgrown in size to accommodate its deficiency is suddenlysupplied an adequate amount of iodine, it could suddenlymake large amounts of thyroxin and cause a thyroid storm,the equivalent of racing your car motor at top speed.\nHyperthyroidism can be treated with medications,\ntherapeutic doses of radioactive iodine, or surgical reduc-tion. Surgery is much less common now than it used tobe because of progress in drugs and radiotherapy.\nPrognosis\nAlthough goiters diminish in size, the thyroid may not\nreturn to normal. Sometimes thyroid function does notreturn after treatment, but thyroxin is easy to take as a pill.\nPrevention\nEuthyroid goiter and hypothyroid goiter are com-\nmon around the world because many regions have inade-quate dietary iodine, including some places in the UnitedStates.

    "title": "Gonorrhea",
    "content": "Gonorrhea\nDefinition\nGonorrhea is a highly contagious sexually transmit-\nted disease that is caused by the bacterium Neisseria\ngonorrhoeae . The mucous membranes of the genital\nregion may become inflamed without the development ofany other symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they aredifferent in men and women. In men, gonorrhea usuallybegins as an infection of the vessel that carries urine andsperm (urethra). In women, it will most likely infect thenarrow part of the uterus (cervix). If untreated, gonorrheacan result in serious medical complications.\nDescription\nGonorrhea is commonly referred to as “the clap.”\nThe incidence of gonorrhea has steadily declined sincethe 1980s, largely due to increased public awarenesscampaigns and the risk of contracting other sexually\ntransmitted diseases , such as AIDS . Still, current esti-\nmates range from 400,000 to as many as one million pro-jected cases of gonorrhea in the United States each year.These estimates vary due to the private nature of the dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1471Gonorrheaease and the consequent underreporting that occurs. The\nmajority of reported cases of gonorrhea come from pub-lic health clinics.\nThe disease affects people of all ages, races, and\nsocioeconomic levels, but some individuals are more at-risk than others. Adolescents and young adults are thehighest risk group, with more than 80% of the reportedcases each year occurring in the 15–29 age group. Thoseindividuals with multiple sexual partners and who use nobarrier contraception , such as condoms, are most at-\nrisk. Reported rates vary among racial and ethnic groups.\nThe risk factors for gonorrhea are not unlike those\nfor all sexually transmitted diseases. Both men andwomen can become infected through a variety of sexualcontact behaviors, including oral, anal, or vaginal inter-course. The disease is transmitted very efficiently. Infact, women run a 60–90% chance of contracting the dis-ease after just one sexual encounter with an infectedmale. The disease can also be transmitted from an infect-ed mother to her infant during delivery.\nCauses and symptoms\nIf treated early, gonorrhea can be cured. Unfortu-\nnately, many individuals with gonorrhea, particularlywomen, will experience no symptoms to alert them to thepossibility that they have contracted gonorrhea, andtherefore, many do not seek treatment. When present, thesymptoms and complications of gonorrhea are primarilylimited to the genital, urinary, and gastrointestinal sys-tems and usually begin between one day and two weeksfollowing infection. If left untreated, serious complica-tions can result if the disease spreads to the bloodstreamand infects the brain, heart valves, and joints. Untreatedgonorrhea can also result in severe damage to the repro-ductive system, making an individual unable to conceivea child (sterile).\nSymptoms of gonorrhea in women\nAs many as 80% of women with gonorrhea show no\nsymptoms. If present, symptoms may include the following:\n• bleeding between menstrual periods\n• chronic abdominal pain .\n• painful urination.• vaginal discharge, often cloudy and yellow.• in the case of oral infection, there may be no symptoms\nor only a sore throat .\n• anal infection may cause rectal itching or discharge.\nBecause women often do not show any symptoms,\ncomplications are more likely to occur as the disease pro-gresses. The most common complication is pelvic\ninflammatory disease (PID). PID can occur in up to\n40% of women with gonorrhea and may result in damageto the fallopian tubes, a pregnancy developing outside\nthe uterus ( ectopic pregnancy ), or sterility. If an infected\nwoman is pregnant, gonorrhea can be passed on to hernewborn through the birth canal during delivery. Theseinfants may experience eye infections that could lead toblindness.\nSymptoms of gonorrhea in men\nMen are more likely to experience the following\nsymptoms:\n• thick and cloudy discharge from the penis.\n• burning or pain during urination.\n• more frequent urination.• in the case of oral infection, there may be no symptoms\nor only a sore throat.\n• anal infection may cause rectal itching or discharge.\nIn men, complications can affect the prostate, testi-\ncles, and surrounding glands. Inflammation, tissue death\nand pus formation (abscesses), and scarring can occurand result in sterility.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of gonorrhea can be made at a public\nhealth clinic or a family physician office. First, the doctorwill discuss symptoms and the patient’s known contact orat-risk behavior. There are three methods available to testfor the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae . These include\na culture, a Gram stain, and an ELISA test. Culture ofsecretions from the infected area is the preferred methodfor gonorrhea screening in patients with or without symp-toms. A cotton swab can be used to collect enough samplefor a culture. The sample is incubated for up to two days,providing enough time for the bacteria to multiply and beaccurately identified. This test is nearly 100% accurate.\nGram stains are more accurate in the diagnosis of\ngonorrhea in men than in women. To perform this test, asmall amount of discharge from the infected area willbe placed on a slide, stained with a special dye, andexamined under a microscope for the presence of thegonococcus bacteria. The advantage to this test is thatresults can be obtained very quickly at the initial visit.Because it requires that the physician or technician tobe able to recognize and accurately identify the bacteriasimply by looking at it under a microscope, however,this test is only approximately 70% accurate. As aresult, one of the other methods will also probably beused to confirm the diagnosis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1472GonorrheaELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, has\nemerged as a rapid and sensitive test for gonorrhea. It ismuch more sensitive than the gram stain and is more conve-nient than the culture test, which involves the transport andstorage of samples. As of late 1997, several other diagnostictests were being researched with the goal of providing acost-effective method of screening for a variety of sexuallytransmitted diseases. One of the most interesting of these isa home test that can be taken by the patient themselves,allowing for a degree of privacy and confidentiality.\nWhen a patient suspects exposure to or experiences\nsymptoms of gonorrhea, he or she may see a publichealth provider or family practice physician. Physicianstrained in obstetrics or gynecology may also be involved,particularly if gynecological complications occur. Menwho experience complications may be referred to a urol-ogist. There are also infectious disease doctors who spe-cialize in the treatment and research of all infectious dis-eases, including those transmitted sexually. All doctorsmust report this highly contagious disease to publichealth officials, and patients are asked to provide thenames of sex partners during the suspected period ofinfection so that they can be notified of the risk.\nTreatment\nGonorrhea has become more difficult and expensive\nto treat since the 1970s, due to the increased resistance ofgonorrhea to certain antibiotics . In fact, according to pro-\njections from the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, 30% of the strains of gonorrhea were resistant toroutine antibiotics in 1994, and resistance has beenincreasing steadily. Furthermore, many patients have bothgonorrhea and chlamydial infections. Therefore, two drugtreatment regimens are common. Medications used totreat gonorrhea include ceftriaxone, cefixime, spectino-mycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Ceftriaxone anddoxycycline or azithromycin are often given simultane-ously to treat possible co-existing chlamydia (in pregnantwomen, erythromycin should be substituted for the afore-mentioned anti-chlamydial agents).\nAn extremely important consideration is to make\nsure that all of the prescribed medication is taken. If acourse of antibiotics is not completed, the medication willonly kill those organisms that are susceptible to theantibiotic, allowing those that are resistant to the effectsof that particular antibiotic to multiply and possibly causea new infection that will be more difficult to treat. Patientsshould refrain from sexual intercourse until treatment iscomplete and return for follow-up testing. Any sexualpartners during the time of infection, even if those part-ners do not show symptoms, should be notified and treat-ed when any sexually transmitted disease is involved.Alternative treatment\nAlthough there is no known alternative to antibiotics\nin the treatment of gonorrhea, there are herbs and miner-\nalsthat may be used to supplement antibiotic treatment:\n•Lactobacillus acidophilus or live-culture yogurts are\nhelpful, while taking antibiotics, to replenish gastroin-testinal flora.\n• The following supplements may be used to improve the\nbody’s immune function: zinc, multivitamins and min-eral complexes, vitamin C, and garlic ( Allium sativum ).\n• Several herbs may reduce some symptoms or help\nspeed healing: kelp has balanced vitamins and miner-\nals. Calendula ( Calendula officinalis ), myrrh ( Com-\nmiphora molmol ), and thuja ( Thuja occidentalis ) may\nhelp reduce discharge and inflammation when used as atea or douche.\n• Hot baths may also help reduce pain and inflammation.\n• A variety of herbs may help with symptoms of the\nreproductive and urinary systems.\n• If a physician approves, fasting , combined with certain\njuices, may help cleanse the urinary and gastrointestinalsystems.\n• There may be acupressure and acupuncture points\nthat will help with system cleansing. These exact pres-sure points can be provided and treated by an acupres-surist or acupuncturist.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for patients with gonorrhea varies\nbased on how early the disease is detected and treated. Iftreated early and properly, patients can be entirely curedof the disease. Up to 40% of female patients who are not\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1473Gonorrhea\nA transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Neisse-\nria gonorrhoeae. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced\nby permission.)treated early may develop pelvic inflammatory disease\n(PID) and the possibility of resulting sterility. Althoughthe risk of infertility is higher in women than in men,\nmen may also become sterile if the urethra becomesinflamed ( urethritis ) as a result of an untreated gonor-\nrhea infection. Following an episode of PID, a woman issix to 10 times more likely, should a pregnancy occur, tohave a pregnancy develop outside the uterus (ectopicpregnancy), which can result in death. Liver infectionmay also occur in untreated women. In approximately2% of patients with untreated gonorrhea, the gonococcalinfection may spread throughout the body and can causefever , arthritis-like joint pain, and skin lesions .\nPrevention\nCurrently, there is no vaccine for gonorrhea, but sever-\nal are under development. The best prevention is to abstainfrom having sex or to engage in sex only when in a mutual-ly monogamous relationship in which both partners havebeen tested for gonorrhea, AIDS, and other sexually trans-mitted diseases. The next line of defense is the use of con-doms, which have been shown to be highly effective in pre-venting disease (and unwanted pregnancies). To be 100%effective, condoms must be used properly. A female birth-control device that blocks the entry of sperm into the cervix(diaphragm) can also reduce the risk of infection.

Norris\nGoodpasture’s syndrome\nDefinition\nAn uncommon and life-threatening hypersensitivity\ndisorder believed to be an autoimmune process related toantibody formation in the body. Goodpasture’s syndromeis characterized by renal (kidney) disease and lung hem-orrhage.\nDescription\nThe disorder is characterized by autoimmune reac-\ntion which deposits of antibodies in the membranes ofboth the lung and kidneys, causing both inflammation ofkidney ( glomerulonephritis ) and lung bleeding. It is\ntypically a disease of young males.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause is unknown. It is an autoimmune\ndisorder; that is, the immune system is fighting thebody’s own normal tissues through creating antibodiesthat attack the lungs and kidneys. Sometimes the disor-der is triggered by a viral infection, or by the inhalationof gasoline or other hydrocarbon solvents. An associationalso exists between cigarette smoking and the syndrome.\nThe target antigen of the Goodpasture’s antibodies hasbeen localized to a protein chain (type IV collagen).Symptoms include foamy, bloody, or dark colored\nurine, decreased urine output, cough with bloody spu-\ntum, difficulty breathing after exertion, weakness,fatigue , nausea or vomiting, weight loss, nonspecific\nchest pain and/or pale skin.\nDiagnosis\nThe clinician will perform a battery of tests to con-\nfirm a diagnosis. These tests include a complete blood\ncount (CBC) to confirm anemia, iron levels to check for\nblood loss and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatininelevels to test the kidney function. A urinalysis will be\ndone to check for damage to the kidneys. A sputum testwill be done to look for specific antibodies. A chest x\nraywill be done to assess the amount of fluid in the lung\ntissues. A lung needle biopsy and a kidney biopsy will\nshow immune system deposits. The kidney biopsy canalso show the presence of the harmful antibodies thatattack the lungs and kidneys.\nTreatment\nTreatment is focused on slowing the progression of\nthe disease. Treatment is most effective when begunearly, before kidney function has deteriorated to a pointwhere the kidney is permanently damaged, and dialysisis necessary. Corticosteroids , such as prednisone, or\nother anti-inflammatory medications may be used toreduce the immune response. Immune suppressants suchas cyclophosphamide or azathioprine are used aggres-sively to reduce immune system effects.\nA procedure whereby blood plasma, which contains\nantibodies, is removed from the body and replaced withfluids or donated plasma ( plasmapheresis ) may be per-\nformed daily for two or more weeks to remove circulatingantibodies. It is fairly effective in slowing or reversing thedisorder. Dialysis to clean the blood of wastes may berequired if kidney function is poor. A kidney transplantmay be successful, especially if performed after circulat-ing antibodies have been absent for several months.\nPrognosis\nThe probable outcome is variable. Most cases\nprogress to severe renal failure and end-stage renal dis-ease within months. Early diagnosis and treatment makesthe probable outcome more favorable.\nPrevention\nNo known prevention of Goodpasture’s syndrome\nexists.

It most commonly affects\nthe big toe, but may also affect the heel, ankle, hand,wrist, or elbow. Gout usually comes on suddenly, goesaway after 5–10 days, and can keep recurring. Gout isdifferent from other forms of arthritis because it occurswhen there are high levels of uric acid circulating in theblood, which can cause urate crystals to settle in the tis-sues of the joints.\nDescription\nUric acid, which is found naturally in the blood\nstream, is formed as the body breaks down waste prod-ucts, mainly those containing purine, a substance that isproduced by the body and is also found in high concentra-tions in some foods, including brains, liver, sardines,anchovies, and dried peas and beans. Normally, the kid-neys filter uric acid out of the blood and excrete it in theurine. Sometimes, however, the body produces too muchuric acid or the kidneys aren’t efficient enough at filteringit from the blood, and it builds up in the blood stream, acondition known as hyperuricemia. A person’s suscepti-bility to gout may increase because of the inheritance ofcertain genes or from being overweight and eating a richdiet. In some cases, another disease (such as lymphoma,leukemia, or hemolytic anemia ) may be the underlying\ncause of the uric acid buildup that results in gout.\nHyperuricemia doesn’t always cause gout. However,\nover the course of years, sharp urate crystals build up inthe synovial fluid of the joints. Often, some precipitatingevent, such as an infection, surgery, a stubbed toe, oreven a heavy drinking binge can cause inflammation.White blood cells, mistaking the urate crystals for a for-eign invader, flood into the joint and surround the crys-tals, causing inflammation—in other words, the redness,swelling, and pain that are the hallmarks of a gout attack.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs a result of high levels of uric acid in the blood,\nneedle-like urate crystals gradually accumulate in thejoints. Urate crystals may be present in the joint for a longtime without causing symptoms. Infection, injury to thejoint, surgery, drinking too much, or eating the wrongkinds of foods may suddenly bring on the symptoms,which include pain, tenderness, redness, warmth, andswelling of the joint. In many cases, the gout attackbegins in the middle of the night. The pain is often soexcruciating that the sufferer cannot bear weight on the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1476Goutjoint or tolerate the pressure of bedcovers. The inflamed\nskin over the joint may be red, shiny, and dry, and theinflammation may be accompanied by a mild fever .\nThese symptoms may go away in about a week and disap-pear for months or years at a time. However, over thecourse of time, attacks of gout recur more and more fre-quently, last longer, and affect more joints. Eventually,stone-like deposits known as tophi may build up in thejoints, ligaments, and tendons, leading to permanent jointdeformity and decreased motion. (In addition to causingthe tophi associated with gout, hyperuricemia can alsocause kidney stones , also called renal calculi or uroliths.)\nGout affects an estimated one million Americans. It\nmost commonly afflicts men (800,000 men versus200,000 women). Uric-acid levels tend to increase inmen at puberty , and, because it takes 20 years of hyper-\nuricemia to cause gout symptoms, men commonly devel-op gout in their late 30s or early 40s. Women more typi-cally develop gout later in life, starting in their 60s.According to some medical experts, estrogen protectsagainst hyperuricemia, and when estrogen levels fall dur-ing menopause , urate crystals can begin to build up in\nthe joints. Excess body weight, regular excessive alcoholintake, the use of blood pressure medications calleddiuretics , and high levels of certain fatty substances in\nthe blood (serum triglycerides) associated with anincreased risk of heart disease can all increase a person’srisk of developing gout.\nDiagnosis\nUsually, physicians can diagnose gout based on the\nphysical examination and medical history (the patient’s\ndescription of symptoms and other information). Doctorscan also administer a test that measures the level of uricacid in the blood. While normal uric acid levels don’tnecessarily rule out gout and high levels don’t confirm it,the presence of hyperuricemia increases the likelihood ofgout. The development of a tophus can confirm the diag-nosis of gout. The most definitive way to diagnose goutis to take a sample of fluid from the joint and test it forurate crystals.\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment for gout consist of alleviating\npain, avoiding severe attacks in the future, and prevent-ing long-term joint damage. In addition to taking painmedications as prescribed by their doctors, people havinggout attacks are encouraged to rest and to increase theamount of fluids that they drink.\nAcute attacks of gout can be treated with nonaspirin,\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such\nas naproxen sodium (Aleve), ibuprofen (Advil), orindomethacin (Indocin). In some cases, these drugs can\naggravate a peptic ulcer or existing kidney disease andcannot be used. Doctors sometimes also use colchicine(Colbenemid), especially in cases where nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs cannot be used. Colchicine maycause diarrhea , which tends to go away once the patient\nstops taking it. Corticosteroids such as prednisone\n(Deltasone) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (Acthar)may be given orally or may be injected directly into thejoint for a more concentrated effect. While all of thesedrugs have the potential to cause side effects, they areused for only about 48 hours and are not likely to causemajor problems. However, aspirin and closely related\ndrugs (salicylates) should be avoided because they canultimately worsen gout.\nOnce an acute attack has been successfully treated,\ndoctors try to prevent future attacks of gout and long-term joint damage by lowering uric acid levels in theblood. There are two types of drugs for correcting hyper-uricemia. Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid (Bene-mid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane), lower the levels ofurate in the blood by increasing its removal from thebody (excretion) through the urine. These drugs may pro-mote the formation of kidney stones, and they may notwork for all patients, especially those with kidney dis-ease. Allopurinol (Zyloprim), a type of drug called a xan-thine-oxidase inhibitor, blocks the production of urate inthe body, and can dissolve kidney stones as well as treat-ing gout. The potential side effects of allopurinol includerash, a skin condition known as dermatitis , and liver\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1477Gout\nUric acid\ncrystals\nGout, a form of acute arthritis, most commonly occurs in\nthe big toe.

(Illustration by\nElectronic Illustrators Group.)dysfunction. Once people begin taking these medica-\ntions, they must take them for life or the gout will contin-ue to return.\nAlternative treatment\nThe alternative medicine approach to gout focuses on\ncorrecting hyperuricemia by losing weight and limitingthe intake of alcohol and purine-rich foods. In addition,consuming garlic ( Allium sativum ) has been recommend-\ned to help prevent gout. Increasing fluid intake, especiallyby drinking water, is also recommended. During an acuteattack, contrast hydrotherapy (alternating three-minute\nhot compresses with 30-second cold compresses) canhelp dissolve the crystals and resolve the pain faster.\nPrognosis\nGout cannot be cured but usually it can be managed\nsuccessfully. As tophi dissolve, joint mobility generallyimproves. (In some cases, however, medicines alone do notdissolve the tophi and they must be removed surgically.)Lowering uric acid in the blood also helps to prevent orimprove the kidney problems that may accompany gout.KEY TERMS\nAllopurinol —A drug that corrects hyperuricemia\nby inhibiting urate production.\nColchicine —A drug used to treat painful flare-ups\nof gout.\nCorticosteroids —Medications related to a natural\nbody hormone called hydrocortisone, which areused to treat inflammation.\nHyperuricemia —High levels of a waste product\ncalled uric acid in the blood.\nProbenecid —A drug that corrects hyperuricemia\nby increasing the urinary excretion of urate.\nPurine —A substance found in foods that is broken\ndown into urate and may contribute to hyper-uricemia and gout.\nSulfinpyrazone —A drug that corrects hyperuricemia\nby increasing the urinary excretion of urate.\nSynovial fluid —Fluid surrounding the joints which\nacts as a lubricant, reducing the friction betweenthe joints.\nUrate crystals —Crystals formed by high levels of\nuric acid in the blood.Prevention\nFor centuries, gout has been known as a “rich man’s\ndisease” or a disease of overindulgence in food anddrink. While this view is perhaps a little overstated andoversimplified, lifestyle factors clearly influence a per-son’s risk of developing gout. Since obesity and exces-\nsive alcohol intake are associated with hyperuricemiaand gout, losing weight and limiting alcohol intake canhelp ward off gout. Dehydration may also promote the\nformation of urate crystals, so people taking diuretics or“water pills” may be better off switching to another typeof blood pressure medication, and everyone should besure to drink at least six to eight glasses of water eachday. Since purine is broken down in the body into urate,it may also be helpful to avoid foods high in purine, suchas organ meats, sardines, anchovies, red meat, gravies,beans, beer, and wine.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBurton Goldberg Group.

    "title": "Gout drugs",
    "content": "Gout drugs\nDefinition\nGout drugs are medicines that prevent or relieve the\nsymptoms of gout, a disease that affects the joints andkidneys.\nPurpose\nGout is a disease in which uric acid, a waste product\nthat normally passes out of the body in urine, collects\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1478Gout drugsand forms crystals in the joints and the kidneys. When\nuric acid crystals build up in the joints, the tissue aroundthe joint becomes inflamed, and nerve endings in thearea become irritated, causing extreme pain . Uric acid\ncrystals in the kidneys can lead to kidney stones and\neventually to kidney failure.\nThe symptoms of gout—severe pain, usually in the\nhand or foot (often at the base of the big toe), but some-times in the elbow or knee—should be reported to ahealth care professional. If not treated, gout can lead tohigh blood pressure, deformed joints, and even death\nfrom kidney failure. Fortunately, the condition is easilytreated. For patients who have just had their first attack,physicians may prescribe only medicine to reduce thepain and inflammation, such as nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs ,corticosteroids , or colchicine.\nPatients may also be advised to change their eating anddrinking habits, avoiding organ meats and other protein-rich foods, cutting out alcoholic beverages, and drinkingmore water. Some people never have another gout attackafter the first. For those who do, physicians may prescribeadditional drugs that either help the body get rid of uricacid or reduce the amount of uric acid the body produces.These drugs will not relieve gout attacks that already havestarted, but will help prevent attacks when taken regularly.\nDescription\nThree main types of drugs are used in treating gout.\nColchicine helps relieve the symptoms of gout by reduc-ing inflammation. Allopurinol (Lopurin, Zyloprim)reduces the amount of uric acid produced in the body.Probenecid (Benemid, Probalan) and sulfinpyrazone(Anturane) help the body get rid of excess uric acid.Physicians may recommend that patients take more thanone type of gout drug at the same time. Some of thesemedicines may also be prescribed for other medical con-ditions that are caused by too much uric acid in the body.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\ngout drug. Check with the physician who prescribed thedrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for thecorrect dosage.\nAlways take gout drugs exactly as directed. Never\ntake larger or more frequent doses than recommended.Patients who are told to take more than one gout drugshould carefully follow the physician’s directions for tak-ing all medicines.\nGout drugs such as allopurinol, probenecid, and\nsulfinpyrazone must be taken regularly to prevent goutattacks. The medicine may take some time to beginworking, so gout attacks may continue for awhile afterstarting to take the drug. Continuing to take the drug is\nimportant, even if it does not seem to be working at first.\nColchicine may be taken regularly in low doses to\nhelp prevent gout attacks or in high doses for only a fewhours at a time to relieve an attack. The chance of seriousside effects is greater when this medicine is taken in highdoses for short periods.\nPrecautions\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking gout drugs\nis important. The physician will check to make sure themedicine is working as it should and will watch forunwanted side effects. Blood tests may be ordered tohelp the physician monitor how well the drug is working.\nDrinking alcohol, including beer and wine, may\nincrease the amount of uric acid in the body and mayinterfere with the effects of gout medicine. People withgout (or other conditions that result from excess uricacid) may need to limit the amount of alcohol they drinkor stop drinking alcohol altogether.\nSome people feel drowsy or less alert when taking\ngout drugs. Anyone who takes this type of medicineshould not drive, use machines or do anything else thatmight be dangerous until they have found out how thedrugs affect them.\nSome gout drugs may change the results of certain\nmedical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone takingthis medicine should alert the health care professional incharge.\nOlder people may be especially sensitive to the\neffects of colchicine. The drug may also stay in theirbodies longer than it does in younger people. Both theincreased sensitivity to the drug and the longer time forthe drug to leave the body may increase the chance ofside effects.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or who\nare taking certain other medicines can have problems ifthey take gout drugs. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has ever had unusual reac-\ntions to gout drugs or to medicines used to relieve pain orinflammation should let his or her physician know beforetaking gout drugs. The physician should also be toldabout any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other\nsubstances.\nDIABETES. Some gout drugs may cause false results\non certain urine sugar tests, but not on others. Diabeticpatients who take gout drugs should check with their\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1479Gout drugsphysicians to find out if their medicine will affect the\nresults of their urine sugar tests.\nPREGNANCY. The effects of taking gout drugs dur-\ning pregnancy are not fully understood. Women who are\npregnant or who may become pregnant should checkwith their physicians before using gout drugs.\nBREASTFEEDING. Gout drugs may pass into breast\nmilk. Women who are taking this medicine and want tobreastfeed their babies should check with their physicians.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Gout drugs may\ncause problems for people with certain medical condi-tions. For example, the risk of severe allergic reactions orother serious side effects is greater when people withthese medical conditions take certain gout drugs:\n• congestive heart disease\n• high blood pressure\n• blood disease\n• diabetes\n• kidney disease or kidney stones\n• cancer being treated with drugs or radiation• stomach or intestinal problems, including stomach\nulcer (now or in the past)\nBefore using gout drugs, people with any of medical\nproblems listed above should make sure their physiciansare aware of their conditions.\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking gout drugs\nwith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.\nSide effects\nA skin rash that develops during treatment with gout\ndrugs may be a sign of a serious and possibly life-threat-ening reaction. If any of these symptoms occur, stop tak-ing the medicine and check with a physician immediately:\n• skin rash, itching , or hives\n• scaly or peeling skin\n• chills, fever ,sore throat ,nausea and vomiting , yel-\nlow skin or eyes, joint pain, muscle aches or pains—especially if these symptoms occur at the same time orshortly after a skin rash\nPatients taking colchicine should stop taking it\nimmediately if they have diarrhea , stomach pain, nau-\nsea, or vomiting. If these symptoms continue for 3 hoursor more after the medicine is stopped, check with aphysician.\nOther side effects of may also need medical atten-\ntion. If any of the following symptoms occur while tak-ing gout drugs, check with the physician who prescribed\nthe medicine as soon as possible:\n• pain in the side or lower back\n• painful urination\n• blood in the urine\nLess serious side effects, such as headache , loss of\nappetite, and joint pain and inflammation usually goaway as the body adjusts to the drug and do not needmedical treatment.\nOther side effects may occur. Anyone who has\nunusual symptoms while taking gout drugs should get intouch with his or her physician.\nInteractions\nGout drugs may interact with other medicines.\nWhen this happens, the effects of one or both of thedrugs may change or the risk of side effects may begreater. Anyone who takes gout drugs should let thephysician know all other medicines he or she is taking.Among the drugs that may interact with gout drugs are:\n•Aspirin or other salicylates. These drugs may keep\ngout drugs from working properly.\n• Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indo-\nmethacin (Indocin) and ketoprofen (Orudis). Takingthese medicines with probenecid may increase thechance of side effects from the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n• Blood thinners. When taken with blood thinners, such\nas warfarin (Coumadin), gout drugs may increase thechance of bleeding. A lower blood thinner dose may benecessary.\n• Blood viscosity reducing medicines such as pentoxi-\nfylline (Trental). Taking this medicine with blood thin-ners may increase the chance of bleeding.\n• Medicine for infections. Probenecid may increase the\nlevels of these medicines in the blood. This may makethe other medicine work better, but may also increasethe risk of side effects.\n• The immunosuppressant drug azathioprine (Imuran),\nused to prevent organ rejection in transplant patientsand to treat rheumatoid arthritis . Taking this medi-\ncine with allopurinol can increase the risk of sideeffects from the azathioprine.\n• Anticancer drugs such as mercaptopurine (Purinethol),\nplicamycin (Mithracin), and methotrexate (Rheuma-trex). Taking this medicine with gout drugs mayincrease the risk of side effects from the anticancer drug.\n• Antiretroviral drugs such as zidovudine (Retrovir).\nProbenecid may increase the level of this medicine inthe blood. This may make side effects more likely.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1480Gout drugs• Antiseizure medicines such as Depakote (divalproex) and\nDepakene (valproic acid). Using these medicines withsulfinpyrazone may increase the chance of bleeding.\nThe list above does not include every drug that may\ninteract with gout drugs. Be sure to check with a physi-cian or pharmacist before combining gout drugs with anyother prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter)medicine.\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\nGouty arthritis seeGout\nGraft-vs.-host disease\nDefinition\nGraft-vs.-host disease is an immune attack on the\nrecipient by cells from a donor.\nDescription\nThe main problem with transplanting organs and tis-\nsues is that the recipient host does not recognize the newtissue as its own. Instead, it attacks it as foreign in thesame way it attacks germs, to destroy it.\nIf immunogenic cells from the donor are transplant-\ned along with the organ or tissue, they will attack thehost, causing graft vs. host disease.KEY TERMS\nCorticosteroids —Medicines that are similar to the\nnatural hormone cortisone and belong to the fami-ly of drugs called steroids.\nInflammation —Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\nthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.\nKidney stone —A small, hard mass formed in the\nkidney from deposits of uric acid or other materials.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) —\nA type of medicine used to relieve pain, swelling,and other symptoms of inflammation. Drugs inthis group are not cortisone-like drugs (steroids).\nSalicylates —A group of drugs that includes aspirin\nand related compounds. Salicylates are used torelieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.The only transplanted tissues that house enough\nimmune cells to cause graft vs. host disease are the bloodand the bone marrow. Blood transfusions are used everyday in hospitals for many reasons. Bone marrow trans-plants are used to replace blood forming cells and immunecells. This is necessary for patients whose cancer treat-\nment has destroyed their own bone marrow. Because bonemarrow cells are among the most sensitive to radiation andchemotherapy , it often must be destroyed along with the\ncancer. This is true primarily of leukemias, but some othercancers have also been treated this way.\nCauses and symptoms\nEven if the donor and recipient are well matched,\ngraft-vs.-host disease can still occur. There are manydifferent elements involved in generating immune reac-tions, and each person is different, unless they are iden-tical twins. Testing can often find donors who match allthe major elements, but there are many minor ones thatwill always be different. How good a match is foundalso depends upon the urgency of the need and somegood luck.\nBlood transfusion graft-vs.-host disease affects\nmostly the blood. Blood cells perform three functions:carrying oxygen, fighting infections, and clotting. All ofthese cell types are decreased in a transfusion graft-vs.-host reaction, leading to anemia (lack of red blood cellsin the blood), a decrease in resistance to infections, andan increase in bleeding. The reaction occurs betweenfour to 30 days after the transfusion.\nThe tissues most affected by bone marrow graft-vs.-\nhost disease are the skin, the liver, and the intestines. Oneform or the other occurs in close to half of the patientswho receive bone marrow transplants.\nBone marrow graft-vs.-host disease comes in an\nacute and a chronic form. The acute form appears with-in two months of the transplant; the chronic form usual-ly appears within three months. The acute disease pro-duces a skin rash, liver abnormalities, and diarrhea\nthat can be bloody. The skin rash is primarily a patchythickening of the skin. Chronic disease can produce asimilar skin rash, a tightening or an inflammation of theskin, lesions in the mouth, drying of the eyes andmouth, hair loss, liver damage, lung damage, and indi-\ngestion . The symptoms are similar to an autoimmune\ndisease called scleroderma .\nBoth forms of graft-vs.-host disease bring with them\nan increased risk of infections, either because of theprocess itself or its treatment with cortisone-like drugsand immunosuppressives. Patients can die of liver failure,infection, or other severe disturbances of their system.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1481Graft-vs.-host diseaseTreatment\nBoth the acute and the chronic disease are treated\nwith cortisone-like drugs, immunosuppressive agentslike cyclosporine, or with antibiotics and immune chem-\nicals from donated blood (gamma globulin). Infectionwith one particular virus, called cytomegalovirus (CMV)is so likely a complication that some experts recommendtreating it ahead of time.\nPrognosis\nChildren with acute leukemias have greatly benefit-\ned from the treatment made possible by bone marrow\ntransplantation . Survival rates have climbed by\n15–50%. It is an interesting observation that patients whodevelop graft-vs.-host disease are less likely to have arecurrence of the leukemia that was being treated. Thisphenomenon is called graft-vs.-leukemia.\nBone marrow transplant patients who do not have a\ngraft-vs.-host reaction gradually return to normalimmune function in a year. A graft-vs.-host reaction mayprolong the diminished immune capacity indefinitely,requiring supplemental treatment with immunoglobulins(gamma globulin).\nSomehow the grafted cells develop a tolerance to\ntheir new home after six to 12 months, and the medica-tions can be gradually withdrawn. Graft-vs.-host diseaseis not the only complication of blood transfusion or bonemarrow transplantation. Host-vs.-graft or rejection isalso common and may require a repeat transplant withanother donor organ. Infections are a constant threat inKEY TERMS\nAnemia —Too few red blood cells, or too little\nhemoglobin in them.\nImmunoglobulin —Chemicals in the blood that\ndefend against infections.\nImmunosuppressive —A chemical which sup-\npresses an immune response.\nInflammation —The body’s immune reaction to\npresumed foreign substances like germs.

The red blood cells are less sensi-tive to radiation and are not harmed by this treatment.\nMuch current research is directed towards solving\nthe problem of graft-vs.-host disease. There are efforts toremove the immunogenic cells from the donor tissue, andthere are also attempts to extract and purify bone marrowcells from the patient before treating the cancer. Thesecells are then given back to the patient after treatment hasdestroyed all that were left behind.\nResources\nBOOKS\nArmitage, James O. “Bone Marrow Transplantation.” In Harri-\nson’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Granuloma inguinale",
    "content": "Granuloma inguinale\nDefinition\nGranuloma inguinale is a sexually transmitted infec-\ntion that affects the skin and mucous membranes of theanal and genital areas. Its name is derived from granulo-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1482Granuloma inguinalema, a medical term for a mass or growth of granulation\ntissue, and inguinale , a Latin word that means located in\nthe groin. Granulation tissue is tissue formed duringwound healing that is rich in blood capillaries and has arough or lumpy surface.\nDescription\nGranuloma inguinale is a chronic infection with fre-\nquent relapses caused by a rod-shaped bacterium. Itoccurs worldwide but is most common in tropical or sub-tropical countries, where it is associated with poverty andpoor hygiene. As many as 20% of male patients with sex-\nually transmitted diseases (STDs) in tropical countries\nhave granuloma inguinale. The disease is less common inthe United States, with fewer than 100 reported cases peryear. Most patients are between the ages of 20 and 40years, with a 2:1 male-to-female ratio.\nAlthough granuloma inguinale is relatively uncom-\nmon in the United States in comparison with other STDs,it is still a significant public health problem. It can beacquired through casual sexual contacts when travelingabroad. Moreover, patients with granuloma inguinale arevulnerable to superinfection (infection by other diseaseagents) with other STDs, especially syphilis . Patients\nwith granuloma inguinale are also a high-risk group forAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) trans-\nmission, because the disease causes open genital ulcersthat can be easily invaded by the AIDS virus.\nGranuloma inguinale is spread primarily through\nheterosexual and male homosexual contact; however, itsoccurrence in children and sexually inactive adults indi-cates that it may also be spread by contact with humanfeces. Granuloma inguinale is not highly contagious;however, persons with weakened immune systems are atgreater risk of infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nGranuloma inguinale, which is sometimes called\ndonovanosis, is caused by Calymmatobacterium granulo-\nmatis , a rod-shaped bacterium formerly called Donovania\ngranulomatis . The bacterium has an incubation period\nranging from eight days to 12 weeks, with an average oftwo to four weeks. The disease has a slow and gradualonset, beginning with an inconspicuous pimple or lumpyeruption on the skin. In 90% of patients, the initial sign ofinfection is in the genital region, but a minority of patientswill develop the sore in their mouth or anal area if theirsexual contact involved those parts of the body. Manypatients do not notice the sore because it is small and notusually painful. In some women, the first symptom ofgranuloma inguinale is bleeding from the genitals.The initial pimple or sore is typically followed by\nthree stages of disease. In the first stage, the patientdevelops a mass of pink or dull red granulation tissue inthe area around the anus. In the second stage, the bacteriaerode the skin to form shallow, foul-smelling ulcerswhich spread from the genital and anal areas to the thighsand lower abdomen. The edges of the ulcers are markedby granulation tissue. In the third stage, the ulceratedareas form deep masses of keloid or scar tissue that mayspread slowly for many years.\nPatients with long-term infections are at risk for seri-\nous complications. The ulcers in second-stage granulomainguinale often become superinfected with syphilis orother STD organisms. Superinfected ulcers becomepainful to touch, filled with pus and dead tissue, and aremuch more difficult to treat. There may be sizable areasof tissue destruction in superinfected patients. In addi-tion, the scar tissue produced by third-stage infection cangrow until it closes off parts of the patient’s urinary tract.It is also associated with a higher risk of genital cancer .\nDiagnosis\nThe most important aspect of diagnosis is distin-\nguishing between granuloma inguinale and other STDs,particularly since many patients will be infected withmore than one STD. Public health officials recommendthat patients tested for granuloma inguinale be given ablood test for syphilis as well. In addition, the doctor willneed to distinguish between granuloma inguinale and cer-tain types of skin cancer, amebiasis , fungal infections,\nand other bacterial ulcers. The most significant distin-guishing characteristic of granuloma inguinale is the skinulcer, which is larger than in most other diseases, pain-less, irregular in shape, and likely to bleed when touched.\nThe diagnosis of granuloma inguinale is made by\nfinding Donovan bodies in samples of the patient’s skintissue. Donovan bodies are oval rod-shaped organismsthat appear inside infected tissue cells under a micro-scope. The doctor obtains a tissue sample either by cut-ting a piece of tissue from the edge of an skin ulcer witha scalpel or by taking a punch biopsy. To make a punchbiopsy, the doctor will inject a local anesthetic into anulcerated area and remove a piece of skin about 1/16 ofan inch in size with a surgical skin punch. The tissuesample is then air-dried and stained with Wright’s stain, achemical that will cause the Donovan bodies to show upas dark purple safety pin-shaped objects inside lighter-staining capsules.\nTreatment\nGranuloma inguinale is treated with oral antibiotics .\nThree weeks of treatment with erythromycin, strepto-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1483Granuloma inguinalemycin, or tetracycline, or 12 weeks of treatment with\nampicillin are standard forms of therapy. Although theskin ulcers will start to show signs of healing in about aweek, the patient must take the full course of medicationto minimize the possibility of relapse.\nPrognosis\nMost patients with granuloma inguinale recover\ncompletely, although superinfected ulcers may requirelengthy courses of medication. Early treatment preventsthe complications associated with second- and third-stage infection.\nPrevention\nPrevention of granuloma inguinale has three impor-\ntant aspects:\n• Avoidance of casual sexual contacts, particularly\namong homosexual males, in countries with high ratesof the disease\n• Tracing and examination of an infected person’s recent\nsexual contactsKEY TERMS\nDonovan bodies —Rod-shaped oval organisms\nfound in tissue samples from patients with granu-loma inguinale. Donovan bodies appear deep pur-ple when stained with Wright’s stain.\nGranulation tissue —A kind of tissue formed dur-\ning wound healing, with a rough or irregular sur-face and a rich supply of blood capillaries.\nGranuloma —An inflammatory swelling or growth\ncomposed of granulation tissue, as in granulomainguinale.\nKeloid —An unusual or abnormal growth of scar\ntissue, as in the third stage of granulomainguinale.\nPunch biopsy —A method of obtaining skin sam-\nples under local anesthesia using a surgical skinpunch.\nSuperinfection —A condition in which a patient\nwith a contagious disease acquires a second infec-tion, as when a patient with granuloma inguinaleis also infected with syphilis.\nWright’s stain —A chemical used to stain tissue\nsamples for laboratory analysis.• Monitoring the patient’s ulcers or scar tissue for signs\nof reinfection for a period of six months after antibiotictreatment\nResources\nBOOKS\nChambers, Henry F. “Infectious Diseases: Bacterial & Chlamy-\ndial.” In Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1998.\n37th ed.

    "content": "Group therapy\nDefinition\nGroup therapy is a form of psychosocial treatment\nwhere a small group of patients meet regularly to talk,interact, and discuss problems with each other and thegroup leader (therapist).\nPurpose\nGroup therapy attempts to give individuals a safe\nand comfortable place where they can work out problemsand emotional issues. Patients gain insight into their ownthoughts and behavior, and offer suggestions and supportto others. In addition, patients who have a difficult time\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1484Group therapywith interpersonal relationships can benefit from the\nsocial interactions that are a basic part of the group thera-py experience.\nPrecautions\nPatients who are suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, or in\nthe midst of a major acute crisis are typically not referredfor group therapy until their behavior and emotional statehave stabilized. Depending on their level of functioning,cognitively impaired patients (like patients with organicbrain disease or a traumatic brain injury) may also beunsuitable for group therapy intervention. Some patientswith sociopathic traits are not suitable for most groups.\nDescription\nA psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other\nhealthcare professional typically arranges and conductsgroup therapy sessions. In some therapy groups, two co-therapists share the responsibility of group leadership.Patients are selected on the basis of what they might gainfrom group therapy interaction and what they can con-tribute to the group as a whole.\nTherapy groups may be homogeneous or heteroge-\nneous. Homogeneous groups have members with similardiagnostic backgrounds (for example, they may all sufferfrom depression). Heterogeneous groups have a mix ofindividuals with different emotional issues. The numberof group members varies widely, but is typically no morethan 12. Groups may be time limited (with a predeter-mined number of sessions) or indefinite (where the groupdetermines when therapy ends). Membership may beclosed or open to new members once sessions begin.\nThe number of sessions in group therapy depends on\nthe makeup, goals, and setting of the group. For example,a therapy group that is part of a substance abuse programto rehabilitate inpatients would be called short-termgroup therapy. This term is used because, as patients, thegroup members will only be in the hospital for a relative-ly short period of time. Long-term therapy groups maymeet for six months, a year, or longer. The therapeuticapproach used in therapy depends on the focus of thegroup and the psychological training of the therapist.Some common techniques include psychodynamic, cog-nitive-behavioral, and Gestalt therapy .\nIn a group therapy session, group members are\nencouraged to openly and honestly discuss the issuesthat brought them to therapy. They try to help othergroup members by offering their own suggestions,insights, and empathy regarding their problems. Thereare no definite rules for group therapy, only that mem-bers participate to the best of their ability. However,most therapy groups do have some basic ground rules\nthat are usually discussed during the first session.Patients are asked not to share what goes on in therapysessions with anyone outside of the group. This protectsthe confidentiality of the other members. They may alsobe asked not to see other group members socially out-side of therapy because of the harmful effect it mighthave on the dynamics of the group.\nThe therapist’s main task is to guide the group in\nself-discovery. Depending on the goals of the group andthe training and style of the therapist, he or she maylead the group interaction or allow the group to taketheir own direction. Typically, the group leader doessome of both, providing direction when the group getsoff track while letting them set their own agenda. Thetherapist may guide the group by simply reinforcing thepositive behaviors they engage in. For example, if agroup member shows empathy to another member, oroffers a constructive suggestion, the therapist will pointthis out and explain the value of these actions to thegroup. In almost all group therapy situations, the thera-pist will attempt to emphasize the common traits amonggroup members so that members can gain a sense ofgroup identity. Group members realize that others sharethe same issues they do.\nThe main benefit group therapy may have over indi-\nvidual psychotherapy is that some patients behave andreact more like themselves in a group setting than theywould one-on-one with a therapist. The group therapypatient gains a certain sense of identity and social accep-tance from their membership in the group. Suddenly,they are not alone. They are surrounded by others whohave the same anxieties and emotional issues that theyhave. Seeing how others deal with these issues may givethem new solutions to their problems. Feedback fromgroup members also offers them a unique insight intotheir own behavior, and the group provides a safe forumin which to practice new behaviors. Lastly, by helpingothers in the group work through their problems, grouptherapy members can gain more self-esteem. Group ther-apy may also simulate family experiences of patients andwill allow family dynamic issues to emerge.\nSelf-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and\nWeight Watchers fall outside of the psychotherapy realm.These self-help groups do offer many of the same bene-fits of social support, identity, and belonging that makegroup therapy effective for many. Self-help group mem-bers meet to discuss a common area of concern (likealcoholism , eating disorders, bereavement, parenting).\nGroup sessions are not run by a therapist, but by a non-professional leader, group member, or the group as awhole. Self-help groups are sometimes used in additionto psychotherapy or regular group therapy.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1485Group therapyPreparation\nPatients are typically referred for group therapy by a\npsychologist or psychiatrist. Some patients may needindividual therapy first. Before group sessions begin, thetherapist leading the session may conduct a short intakeinterview with the patient to determine if the group isright for the patient. This interview will also allow thetherapist to determine if the addition of the patient willbenefit the group. The patient may be given some prelim-inary information on the group before sessions begin.This may include guidelines for success (like being open,listening to others, taking risks), rules of the group (likemaintaining confidentiality), and educational informa-tion on what group therapy is about.\nAftercare\nThe end of long-term group therapy may cause feel-\nings of grief, loss, abandonment, anger, or rejection insome members. The group therapist will attempt to fostera sense of closure by encouraging members to exploretheir feelings and use newly acquired coping techniquesto deal with them. Working through this terminationphase of group therapy is an important part of the treat-\nment process.\nRisks\nSome very fragile patients may not be able to toler-\nate aggressive or hostile comments from group members.Patients who have trouble communicating in group situa-tions may be at risk for dropping out of group therapy. Ifno one comments on their silence or makes an attempt tointeract with them, they may begin to feel even more iso-lated and alone instead of identifying with the group.Therefore, the therapist usually attempts to encouragesilent members to participate early on in treatment.\nNormal results\nStudies have shown that both group and individual psy-\nchotherapy benefit about 85% of the patients that participatein them. Optimally, patients gain a better understanding ofthemselves, and perhaps a stronger set of interpersonal andcoping skills through the group therapy process. Somepatients may continue therapy after group therapy ends,either individually or in another group setting.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1486Group therapy\nGroup therapy is practiced in a variety of settings, including both inpatient and outpatient facilities, and is used to treat anx i-\nety, mood, and personality disorders as well as psychoses.

    "content": "Growth hormone tests\nDefinition\nGrowth hormone (hGH), or somatotropin, is a hor-\nmone responsible for normal body growth and develop-ment by stimulating protein production in muscle cellsand energy release from the breakdown of fats. Tests forgrowth hormone include Somatotropin hormone test,Somatomedin C, Growth hormone suppression test (glu-cose loading test), and Growth hormone stimulation test(Arginine test or Insulin tolerance test).\nPurpose\nGrowth hormone tests are ordered for the following\nreasons:KEY TERMS\nCognitive-behavioral —A therapy technique that\nfocuses on changing beliefs, images, and thoughtsin order to change maladjusted behaviors.\nGestalt —A humanistic therapy technique that\nfocuses on gaining an awareness of emotions andbehaviors in the present rather than in the past.\nPsychodynamic —A therapy technique that\nassumes improper or unwanted behavior is causedby unconscious, internal conflicts and focuses ongaining insight into these motivations.• to identify growth deficiencies, including delayed puber-\ntyand small stature in adolescents which can result from\npituitary or thyroid malfunction\n• to aid in the diagnosis of hyperpituitarism that is evi-\ndent in gigantism or acromegaly\n• to screen for inadequate or reduced pituitary gland\nfunction\n• to assist in the diagnosis of pituitary tumors or tumors\nrelated to the hypothalamus, an area of the brain\n• to evaluate hGH therapy\nPrecautions\nTaking certain drugs such as amphetamines, dop-\namine, corticosteroids , and phenothiazines may increase\nand decrease growth hormone secretion, respectively.Other factors influencing hGH secretion include stress ,\nexercise , diet, and abnormal glucose levels. These tests\nshould not be done within a week of any radioactive scan.\nDescription\nSeveral hormones play important roles in human\ngrowth. The major human growth hormone (hGH), orsomatotropin, is a protein made up of 191 amino acidswhich is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland andcoordinates normal growth and development. Humangrowth is characterized by two spurts, one at birth andthe other at puberty. hGH plays an important role at bothof these times. Normal individuals have measurable lev-els of hGH throughtout life. Yet levels of hGH fluctuateduring the day and are affected by eating and exercise.Receptors which respond to hGH exist on cells and tis-sues throughout the body. The most obvious effect ofhGH is on linear skeletal development. But the metaboliceffects of hGH on muscle, the liver, and fat cells are criti-cal to its function. Humans have two forms of hGH, andthe functional difference between the two is unclear.They are both formed from the same gene, but one lacksthe amino acids in positions 32–46.\nhGH is produced in the anterior portion of the pitu-\nitary gland by somatotrophs under the control of hor-monal signals in the hypothalamus. Two hypothalamichormones regulate hGH; they are growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and growth hormone—inhibiting hormone (GHIH). When blood glucose levelsfall, GHRH triggers the secretion of stored hGH. Asblood glucose levels rise, GHRH release is turned off.Increases in blood protein levels trigger a similarresponse. As a result of this hypothalamic feedback loop,hGH levels fluctuate throughout the day. Normal plasmahGH levels 1–3 ng/ML with peaks as high as 60 ng/ML.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1487Growth hormone testsIn addition, plasma glucose and amino acid availability\nfor growth is also regulated by the hormones adrenaline,glucagon, and insulin.\nMost hGH is released at night. Peak spikes of hGH\nrelease occur around 10 \nP.M., midnight, and 2 A.M. The\nlogic behind this night-time release is that most of hGH’seffects are mediated by other hormones, including thesomatomedins, IGH-I and IGH-II. As a result, the effectsof hGH are spread out more evenly during the day.\nA number of hormonal conditions can lead to exces-\nsive or diminished growth. Because of its critical role inproducing hGH and other hormones, an aberrant pitu-itary gland will often yield altered growth. Dwarfism(very small stature) can be due to underproduction ofhGH, lack of IGH-I, or a flaw in target tissue response toeither of these growth hormones. Overproduction ofhGH or IGH-I, or an exaggerated response to these hor-mones can lead to gigantism or acromegaly, both ofwhich are characterized by a very large stature.\nGigantism is the result of hGH overproduction in\nearly childhood leading to a skeletal height up to 8 feet(2.5m) or more. Acromegaly results when hGH is over-produced after the onset of puberty. In this condition, theepiphyseal plates of the long bone of the body do notclose, and they remain responsive to additional stimulat-ed growth by hGH. This disorder is characterized by anenlarged skull, hands and feet, nose, neck, and tongue.\nSomatrotropin\nSomatrotropin is used to identify hGH deficiency in\nadolescents with short stature, delayed sexual maturity,and other growth deficiencies. It also aids in document-ing excess hGH production that is responsible for gigan-tism or acromegaly, and confirms underactivity or over-production of the pituitary gland ( hypopituitarism or\nhyperpituitarism). However, due to the episodic secretionof hGH, as well as hGH production in response to stress,exercise, or other factors, random assays are not an ade-quate determination of hGH deficiency. To negate thesevariables and obtain more accurate readings, a bloodsample can be drawn one to 1.5 hours after sleep (hGHlevels increase during sleep), or strenuous exercise canbe performed for 30 minutes before blood is drawn (hGHlevels increase after exercise). The hGH levels at the endof an exercise period are expected to be maximal.\nSomatomedin C\nThe somatomedin C test is usually ordered to detect\npituitary abnormalities, hGH deficiency, and acromegaly.Also called insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1),somatomedin C is considered a more accurate reflectionof the blood concentration of hGH because such vari-ables as time of day, activity levels, or diet does not influ-\nence the results. Somatomedin C is part of a group ofpeptides, called somatomedins, through which hGHexerts its effects. Because it circulates in the bloodstreambound to long-lasting proteins, it is more stable thanhGH. Levels of somatomedin C do depend on hGH lev-els, however. As a result, somatomedin C levels are lowwhen hGH levels are deficient. Abnormally low testresults of somatomedin C require an abnormally reducedor absent hGH during an hGH stimulation test in order todiagnose hGH deficiency. Nonpituitary causes ofreduced somatomedin C include malnutrition ,s e v e r e\nchronic illness, severe liver disease, hypothyroidism ,\nand Laron’s dwarfism.\nGrowth hormone stimulation test\nThe hGH stimulation test, also called hGH Provoca-\ntion test, Insulin Tolerance, or Arginine test, is per-formed to test the body’s ability to produce humangrowth hormone, and to identify suspected hGH defi-ciency. A normal patient can have low hGH levels, but ifhGH is still low after stimulation, a diagnosis can bemore accurately made.\nInsulin-induced hypoglycemia (via intravenous\ninjection of insulin) stimulates hGH and corticotropinsecretion as well. If such stimulation is unsuccessful,then there is a malfunction of the anterior pituitary gland.Blood samples may be obtained following an energeticexercise session lasting 20 minutes.\nA substance called hGH-releasing factor has recent-\nly been used for hGH stimulation. This approach promis-es to be more accurate and specific for hGH deficiencycaused by the pituitary. Growth hormone deficiency isalso suspected when x ray determination of bone ageindicates retarded growth in comparison to chronologicage. At present, the best method to identify hGH-defi-cient patients is a positive stimulation test followed by apositive response to a therapeutic trial of hGH.\nGrowth hormone suppression test\nAlso called the glucose loading test, this procedure\nis used to evaluate excessive baseline levels of humangrowth hormone, and to confirm diagnosis of gigantismin children and acromegaly in adults. The procedurerequires two different blood samples, one drawn beforethe administration of 100 g of glucose (by mouth), and asecond sample two hours after glucose ingestion.\nNormally, a glucose load suppresses hGH secretion.\nIn a patient with excessive hGH levels, failure of sup-pression indicates anterior pituitary dysfunction and con-firms a diagnosis of acromegaly and gigantism .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1488Growth hormone testsPreparation\nSomatotropin: This test requires a blood sample. The\npatient should be fasting (nothing to eat or drink from\nmidnight the night before the test). Stress and/or exerciseincreases hGH levels, so the patient should be at completerest for 30 minutes before the blood sample is drawn. Ifthe physician has requested two samples, they should bedrawn on consecutive days at approximately the sametime on both days, preferably between 6 \nAMand 8 AM.\nSomatomedin C: This test requires a blood sample.\nThe patient should have nothing to eat or drink frommidnight the night before the test.\nGrowth hormone stimulation: This test requires\nintravenous administration of medications and the with-drawal of frequent blood samples, which are obtained at0, 60, and 90 minutes after injection of arginine and/orinsulin. The patient should have nothing to eat or drinkafter midnight the night before the test.\nGrowth hormone suppression: This test requires two\nblood samples, one before the test and another two hoursafter administration of 100 g of glucose solution bymouth. The patient should have nothing to eat or drinkafter midnight, and physical activity should be limitedfor 10–12 hours before the test.\nRisks\nGrowth hormone stimulation: Only minor discomfort\nis associated with this test, and results from the insertionof the IV line and the low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)induced by the insulin injection. Some patients may expe-rience sleepiness, sweating and/or nervousness, all ofwhich can be corrected after the test by ingestion of cook-ies, juice, or a glucose infusion. Severe cases of hypo-glycemia may cause ketosis (excessive amounts of fattyacid byproducts in the body), acidosis (a disturbance ofthe body’s acid-base balance), or shock . With the close\nobservation required for the test, these are unlikely.\nGrowth hormone suppression: Some patients experi-\nence nausea after the administration of this amount ofglucose. Ice chips can alleviate this symptom.\nNormal results\nNormal results may vary from laboratory to labora-\ntory but are usually within the following ranges:\nSomatotropin:\n• men: 5 ng/ml• women: less than 10 ng/ml\n• children: 0–10 ng/ml\n• newborn: 10–40 ng/mlKEY TERMS\nAcromegaly —A rare disease resulting from exces-\nsive growth hormone caused by a benign tumor. Ifsuch a tumor develops within the first ten years oflife, the result is gigantism (in which growth isaccelerated) and not acromegaly. Symptomsinclude coarsening of the facial features, enlarge-ment of the hands, feet, ears, and nose, jutting ofthe jaw, and a long face.\nDwarfism, pituitary —Short stature. When caused\nby inadequate amounts of growth hormone (asopposed to late growth spurt or genetics), hGHdeficiency results in abnormally slow growth andshort stature with normal proportions.\nGigantism —Excessive growth, especially in height,\nresulting from overproduction during childhood oradolescence of growth hormone by a pituitarytumor. Untreated, the tumor eventually destroysthe pituitary gland, resulting in death during earlyadulthood. If the tumor develops after growth hasstopped, the result is acromegaly, not gigantism.\nPituitary gland —The pituitary is the most impor-\ntant of the endocrine glands (glands that releasehormones directly into the bloodstream). Some-times referred to as the “master gland,” the pitu-itary regulates and controls the activities of otherendocrine glands and many body processes.\nSomatomedin C:\n• adult: 42–110 ng/ml\nChild:\n• 0–8 years: Girls 7–110 ng/ml; Boys 4–87 ng/ml\n• 9–10 years: Girls 39–186 ng/ml; Boys 26–98 ng/ml• 11–13 years: Girls 66–215 ng/ml; Boys 44–207 ng/ml\n• 14–16 years: Girls 96–256 ng/ml; Boys 48 255 ng/ml\nGrowth hormone stimulation: greater than 10 ng/ml.\nGrowth hormone suppression: Normally, glucose\nsuppresses hGH to levels of undetectable to 3 ng/ml in30 minutes to two hours. In children, rebound stimula-tion may occur after two to five hours.\nAbnormal results\nSomatotropin hormone: Excess hGH is responsible\nfor the syndromes of gigantism and acromegaly. Excesssecretion is stimulated by anorexia nervosa , stress,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1489Growth hormone testshypoglycemia, and exercise. Decreased levels are seen in\nhGH deficiency, dwarfism, hyperglycemia, failure to\nthrive , and delayed sexual maturity.\nSomatomedin C: Increased levels contribute to the\nsyndromes of gigantism and acromegaly. Stress, majorsurgery, hypoglycemia, starvation , and exercise stimulate\nhGH secretion, which in turn stimulates somatomedin C.\nGrowth hormone stimulation: Decreased levels are\nseen in pituitary deficiency and hGH deficiency. Dis-eases of the pituitary can result in failure of the pituitaryto secrete hGH and/or all the pituitary hormones. As aresult, the hGH stimulation test will fail to stimulatehGH secretion.\nGrowth hormone suppression: The acromegaly syn-\ndrome elevates base hGH levels to 75 ng/ml, which inturn are not suppressed to less than 5 ng/ml during thetest. Excess hGH secretion may cause unchanged or ris-ing hGH levels in response to glucose loading, confirm-ing a diagnosis of acromegaly or gigantism. In suchcases, verification of results is required by repeating thetest after a one-day rest.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew. Handbook of Diagnostic Tests.

    "title": "Guided imagery",
    "content": "Guided imagery\nDefinition\nGuided imagery is the use of relaxation and mental\nvisualization to improve mood and/or physical well-being.\nPurpose\nThe connection between the mind and physical\nhealth has been well documented and extensively stud-ied. Positive mental imagery can promote relaxation andreduce stress , improve mood, control high blood pres-\nsure, alleviate pain , boost the immune system, and lower\ncholesterol and blood sugar levels. Through guidedimagery techniques, patients can learn to control func-tions normally controlled by the autonomic nervous sys-tem, such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate,and body temperature.\nOne of the biggest benefits of using guided imagery\nas a therapeutic tool is its availability. Imagery can beused virtually anywhere, anytime. It is also an equalopportunity therapy. Although some initial training in thetechnique may be required, guided imagery is accessibleto virtually everyone regardless of economic status, edu-cation, or geographical location.\nGuided imagery also gives individuals a sense of\nempowerment, or control. The technique is induced by atherapist who guides the patient. The resulting mentalimagery used is solely a product of the individual’s imag-ination. Some individuals have difficulty imagining.They may not get actual clear images but perhaps vaguefeelings about the guided journey. However these indi-viduals’ brains and nervous systems responses seem tobe the same as those with more detailed imaginings.\nPatients who feel uncomfortable “opening up” in a\ntraditional therapist-patient session may feel more at easewith a self-directed therapy like guided imagery.\nDescription\nGuided imagery is simply the use of one’s imagina-\ntion to promote mental and physical health. It can beself-directed, where the individual puts himself into arelaxed state and creates his own images, or directed byothers. When directed by others, an individual listens to atherapist, video, or audiotaped exercise that leads himthrough a relaxation and imagery exercise. Some thera-pists also use guided imagery in group settings.\nGuided imagery is a two-part process. The first com-\nponent involves reaching a state of deep relaxationthrough breathing and muscle relaxation techniques. Dur-ing the relaxation phase, the person closes her eyes andfocuses on the slow, in and out sensation of breathing. Or,she might focus on releasing the feelings of tension fromher muscles, starting with the toes and working up to thetop of the head. Relaxation tapes often feature soft musicor tranquil, natural sounds such as rolling waves andchirping birds in order to promote feelings of relaxation.\nOnce complete relaxation is achieved, the second\ncomponent of the exercise is the imagery, or visualization,itself. There are a number of different types of guidedimagery techniques, limited only by the imagination. Somecommonly used types include relaxation imagery, healingimagery, pain control imagery, and mental rehearsal.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1490Guided imageryRelaxation imagery\nRelaxation imagery involves conjuring up pleasant,\nrelaxing images that rest the mind and body. These may beexperiences that have already happened, or new situations.\nHealing imagery\nPatients coping with diseases and injuries can imagine\ncancer cells dying, wounds healing, and the body mending\nitself. Or, patients may picture themselves healthy, happy,and symptom-free. Another healing imagery technique isbased on the idea of qi, or energy flow, an idea borrowed\nfrom traditional Chinese medicine . Chinese medicine\npractitioners believe that illness is the result of a blockageor slowing of energy flow in the body. Individuals may useguided imagery to imagine energy moving freely through-out the body as a metaphor for good health.\nPain control imagery\nIndividuals can control pain through several imagery\ntechniques. One method is to produce a mental image ofthe pain and then transform that image into somethingless frightening and more manageable. Another is toimagine the pain disappearing, and the patient as com-pletely pain-free. Or, one may imagine the pain as some-thing over which he has complete control. For example,patients with back problems may imagine their pain as ahigh voltage electric current surging through their spine.As they use guided imagery techniques, they can picturethemselves reaching for an electrical switch and turningdown the power on the current to alleviate the pain.\nMental rehearsal\nMental rehearsal involves imagining a situation or\nscenario and its ideal outcome. It can be used to reduceanxiety about an upcoming situation, such as labor and\ndelivery, surgery, or even a critical life event such as animportant competition or a job interview. Individuals pic-ture themselves going through each step of the anxiety-producing event and then successfully completing it.\nPreparations\nFor a successful guided imagery session, individuals\nshould select a quiet, relaxing location where there is acomfortable place to sit or recline. If the guided imagerysession is to be prompted with an audiotape or videotape,a stereo, VCR, or portable tape player should be avail-able. Some people find that quiet background musicimproves their imagery sessions.\nThe session, which can last anywhere from a few\nminutes to an hour, should be uninterrupted. Taking thephone off the hook and asking family members for soli-tude can ensure a more successful and relaxing session.KEY TERMS\nAromatherapy —The therapeutic use of plant-\nderived, aromatic essential oils to promote physi-cal and psychological well-being.\nAutonomic nervous system —The part of the ner-\nvous system that controls so-called involuntaryfunctions such as heart rate, salivary gland secre-tion, respiratory function, and pupil dilation.\nImagery combined with other relaxation techniques\nsuch as yoga , massage, or aromatherapy can greatly\nenhance the effects of these therapies.

Symptoms of muscle weaknessappear one to four weeks later. The most common pre-ceding infections are cytomegalovirus, herpes, Epstein-Barr virus, and viral hepatitis. A gastrointestinal infec-tion with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni is also com-\nmon and may cause a severe type of GBS from which itis particularly difficult to recover. About 5% of GBSpatients have a surgical procedure as a preceding event.Patients with lymphoma, systemic lupus erythemato-\nsus, or AIDS have a higher than normal risk of GBS.\nOther GBS patients have recently received an immuniza-tion, while still others have no known preceding event. In1976–77, there was a vastly increased number of GBScases among people who had been recently vaccinatedagainst the Swine flu. The reason for this phenomenonhas never been identified, and no other flu vaccine hascaused such an increase in GBS cases.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of the weakness and paralysis of GBS is\nthe loss of myelin, which is the material that coats nervecells (the loss of myelin is called demyelination). Myelinis an insulating substance which is wrapped aroundnerves in the body, serving to speed conduction of nerveimpulses. Without myelin, nerve conduction slows orstops. GBS has a short, severe course. It causes inflam-mation and destruction of the myelin sheath, and it dis-turbs multiple nerves. Therefore, it is considered an acuteinflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.\nThe reason for the destruction of myelin in GBS is\nunknown, although it is thought that the underlying prob-lem is autoimmune in nature. An autoimmune disorder isone in which the body’s immune system, trained to fightagainst such foreign invaders as viruses and bacteria,somehow becomes improperly programmed. The immunesystem becomes confused, and is not able to distinguishbetween foreign invaders and the body itself. Elements ofthe immune system are unleashed against areas of thebody, resulting in damage and destruction. For some rea-son, in the case of GBS, the myelin sheath appears tobecome a target for the body’s own immune system.\nThe first symptoms of GBS consist of muscle weak-\nness (legs first, then arms, then face), accompanied byprickly, tingling sensations (paresthesias). Symptoms affectboth sides of the body simultaneously, a characteristic thathelps distinguish GBS from other causes of weakness andparesthesias. Normal reflexes are first diminished, thenlost. The weakness eventually affects all the voluntary mus-cles, resulting in paralysis. When those muscles necessaryfor breathing become paralyzed, the patient must be placedon a mechanical ventilator which takes over the function ofbreathing. This occurs about 30% of the time. Very severe-ly ill GBS patients may have complications stemming fromother nervous system abnormalities which can result inproblems with fluid balance in the body, severely fluctuat-ing blood pressure, and heart rhythm irregularities.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of GBS is made by looking for a particu-\nlar cluster of symptoms (progressively worse muscleweakness and then paralysis), and by examining the fluidthat bathes the brain and spinal canal through cere-\nbrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis . This fluid is obtained by\ninserting a needle into the lower back (lumbar region).When examined in a laboratory, the CSF of a GBSpatient will reveal a greater-than-normal quantity of pro-tein, with normal numbers of white blood cells and a nor-mal amount of sugar. Electrodiagnostic studies mayshow slowing or block of conduction in nerve endings inparts of the body other than the brain. Minor abnormali-ties will be present in 90% of patients.\nTreatment\nThere is no direct treatment for GBS. Instead, treat-\nments are used that support the patient with the disabili-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1492Guillain-Barré syndrometies caused by the disease. The progress of paralysis must\nbe carefully monitored, in order to provide mechanicalassistance for breathing if it becomes necessary. Carefulattention must also be paid to the amount of fluid thepatient is taking in by drinking and eliminating by urinat-ing. Blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm alsomust be monitored.\nA procedure called plasmapheresis , performed\nearly in the course of GBS, has been shown to shortenthe course and severity of GBS. Plasmapheresis consistsof withdrawing the patient’s blood, passing it through aninstrument that separates the different types of bloodcells, and returning all the cellular components (red andwhite blood cells and platelets) along with either donorplasma or a manufactured replacement solution. This isthought to rid the blood of the substances that are attack-ing the patient’s myelin.\nIt has also been shown that the use of high doses of\nimmunoglobulin given intravenously (by drip through aneedle in a vein) may be just as helpful as plasmaphere-sis. Immunoglobulin is a substance naturally manufac-tured by the body’s immune system in response to vari-ous threats. It is interesting to note that corticosteroidmedications (such as prednisone), often the mainstay ofanti-autoimmune disease treatment, are not only unhelp-ful, but may in fact be harmful to patients with GBS.\nPrognosis\nAbout 85% of GBS patients make reasonably good\nrecoveries. However, 30% of adult patients, and a greaterpercentage of children, never fully regain their previouslevel of muscle strength. Some of these patients sufferfrom residual weakness, others from permanent paraly-sis. About 10% of GBS patients begin to improve, thensuffer a relapse. These patients suffer chronic GBSsymptoms. About 5% of all GBS patients die, most fromcardiac rhythm disturbances.\nPatients with certain characteristics tend to have a\nworse outcome. These include people of older age, thosewho required breathing support with a mechanical venti-lator, and those who had their worst symptoms within thefirst seven days.\nPrevention\nBecause so little is known about what causes GBS to\ndevelop, there are no known methods of prevention.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBosch, E.

Infection is not apparent until a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1493Guinea worm infectionKEY TERMS\nGuinea worm embryo —The guinea worm at its\nearliest life stage prior to or shortly after beingexpelled from an adult female worm.\nGuinea worm larvae —The guinea worm during its\nmiddle life stage as it matures within a water flea.The larvae can only grow to adulthood within ahuman host.\nHost —With regard to guinea worm infection,\neither the water flea or human from which theworm gets nourishment and shelter as it matures.\nSecondary infection —An illness—typically caused\nby bacteria—that follows from a guinea worminfection.pregnant female worm prepares to expel embryos. The\ninfection is rarely fatal, but the latter stage is painful. Theinfection is also referred to as dracunculiasis, and lesscommonly as dracontiasis.\nDescription\nBefore the early 1980s, guinea worms infected\n10–15 million people annually in central Africa and partsof Asia. By 1996, worldwide incidence of infection fellto fewer than 153,000 cases per year. Complete eradica-tion of guinea worm infection is a goal of internationalwater safety programs.\nTo survive, guinea worms require three things: water\nduring the embryo stage, an intermediate host duringearly maturation, and a human host during adulthood. Inbodies of water, such as ponds, guinea worm embryosare eaten by tiny, lobster-like water fleas. Once ingested,the embryos mature into larvae.\nHumans become hosts by consuming water contain-\ning infected water fleas. Once in the human intestine, lar-vae burrow into surrounding tissue. After three to fourmonths, the worms mate. Males die soon after, but preg-nant females continue to grow. As adults, each threadlikeworm can be three feet long and harbor three millionembryos. More than one guinea worm can infect a per-son at the same time.\nAbout eight months later, the female prepares to\nexpel mature embryos by migrating toward the skin sur-face. Until this point, most people are unaware that theyare infected. Extreme pain occurs as the worm emerges\nfrom under the skin, often around the infected person’sankle. The pain is temporarily relieved by immersing thearea in water, an act that contaminates the water andstarts the cycle again.\nCauses and symptoms\nDracunculus medinensis , or guinea worm, causes\ninfection. Symptoms are commonly absent until a preg-nant worm prepares to expel embryos. By secreting anirritating chemical, the worm causes a blister to form onthe skin surface. This chemical also causes nausea, vom-iting, dizziness , and diarrhea . The blister is accompa-\nnied by a burning, stabbing pain and can form anywhereon the body; but, the usual site is the lower leg or foot.Once the blister breaks, an open sore remains until theworm has expelled all the embryos.\nDiagnosis\nGuinea worm infection is identified by the symp-\ntoms.Treatment\nMost people infected with guinea worm rely on tradi-\ntional medicine. The worm is extracted by gently and grad-ually pulling the worm out and winding it around a smallstrip of wood. Surgical removal is possible, but rarely donein rural areas. Extraction is complemented by herbs andoils to treat the wound site. Such treatment can ease extrac-tion and may help prevent secondary infections.\nModern medicine offers safe surgical removal of\nthe guinea worm, and drug therapy can prevent infectionand pain. Using drugs to combat the worms has hadmixed results.\nPrognosis\nIf the worm is completely removed, the wound heals\nin approximately two to four weeks. However, if a wormemerges from a sensitive area, such as the sole of a foot, orif several worms are involved, healing requires more time.Recovery is also complicated if the worm breaks duringextraction. Serious secondary infections frequently occurin such situations. There is the risk of permanent disabilityin some cases, and having one guinea worm infection doesnot confer immunity against future infections.\nPrevention\nGuinea worn infection is prevented by disrupting\ntransmission. Wells and other protected water sourcesare usually safe from being contaminated with wormembryos. In open water sources, poisons may be usedto kill water fleas. Otherwise, water must be boiled orfiltered.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1494Guinea worm infectionResources\nPERIODICALS\nHunter, John M. “An Introduction to Guinea Worm on the Eve\nof Its Departure: Dracunculiasis Transmission, HealthEffects, Ecology and Control.” Social Science and Medi-\ncine 43, no. 9 (1996): 1399.\nOTHER\nWorld Health Organization. 7 June 1998 <http://www.who.int/\nhome-page/index.en.shtml>.\nJulia Barrett"

    "title": "Gulf War syndrome",
    "content": "Gulf War syndrome\nDefinition\nGulf War syndrome describes a wide spectrum of ill-\nnesses and symptoms ranging from asthma to sexual\ndysfunction that have been reported by U.S. and U.S.\nallied soldiers who served in the Persian Gulf War in1990–1991.\nDescription\nBetween 1994 and 1999, 145 federally funded\nresearch studies on Gulf War-related illnesses wereundertaken at a cost of over $133 million. Despite thisinvestment and the data collected from over 100,000 vet-erans who have registered with the Department ofDefense (DOD) and/or Veterans Administration (V A) ashaving Gulf War-related illnesses, there is still muchdebate over the origin and nature of Gulf War syndrome.As of early 2001, the DOD has failed to establish a defi-nite cause for the disorder. Veterans who have the illnessexperience a wide range of debilitating symptoms thatelude a single diagnosis. Common symptoms includefatigue , trouble breathing, headaches, disturbed sleep,\nmemory loss, and lack of concentration. Similar experi-ences among Gulf War veterans have been reported in theUnited Kingdom and Canada.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere is much current debate over a possible\ncausative agent for Gulf War syndrome other than thestress of warfare. Intensive efforts by the Veterans\nAdministration and other public and private institutionshave investigated a wide range of potential factors. Theseinclude chemical and biological weapons, the immuniza-tions and preventive treatments used to protect againstthem, smoke from oil well fires, exposure to depleted ura-nium, and diseases endemic to the Arabian peninsula. Sofar investigators have not approached a consensus. In itsfinal report released in December 2000, the PresidentialSpecial Oversight Board for Department of DefenseInvestigations of Gulf War Chemical and Biological Inci-dents cited combat stress as a possible causative factor,but called for further research. There is also a likelihoodthat U.S. and allied forces were exposed to low levels ofsarin and/or cyclosarin (nerve gases) released during thedestruction of Iraqi munitions at Kharnisiyah, Iraq, andthat these chemicals might be linked to the syndrome. InJuly 1997, the V A informed approximately 100,000 U.S.servicemen of their possible exposure to the nerve agents.\nIn October 1999, the U.S. Pentagon released a report\nthat hypothesized that an experimental drug known aspyriostigmine bromide (PB) might be linked to the physi-cal symptoms manifested in Gulf War Syndrome. Theexperimental drug was given to U.S. and Canadian troopsduring the war to protect soldiers against the effects of thechemical nerve agent soman. It has also been suggestedthat botulinum toxoid and anthrax vaccinations adminis-\ntered to soldiers during the conflict may be responsiblefor some manifestations of the syndrome.\nSome studies have shown that Gulf War veterans\nhave a higher incidence of positive tests for Mycoplasma\nfermentans , a bacteria, in their bloodstream. However,\nother clinical studies have not found a link between thebacterial infection and Gulf War-related illnesses.\nStatistical analysis tells us that the following symp-\ntoms are about twice as likely to appear in Gulf War vet-erans than in their non-combat peers: depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic fatigue, cogni-tive dysfunction (diminished ability to calculate, orderthoughts, evaluate, learn, and remember), bronchitis ,\nasthma, fibromyalgia , alcohol abuse, anxiety , and sexu-\nal discomfort. PTSD is the modern equivalent of shellshock (World War I) and battle fatigue (World War II). Itencompasses most of the psychological symptoms of warveterans, including nightmares, panic at sudden loudnoises, and inability to adjust to peacetime living.Chronic fatigue syndrome has a specific medical defin-\nition that attempts to separate common fatigue from amore disabling illness in hope of finding a specific cause.Fibromyalgia is another newly defined syndrome, and assuch it has arbitrarily rigid defining characteristics.These include a certain duration of illness, a specifiedminimum number of joint and muscle pain located in\ndesignated areas of the body, sleep disturbances, andother associated symptoms and signs.\nResearchers have identified three distinct syndromes\nand several variations in Gulf War veterans. Type onepatients suffer primarily from impaired thinking. Type\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1495Gulf War syndromeKEY TERMS\nAtaxia —Lack of coordination.\nCaloric testing —Flushing warm and cold water\ninto the ear stimulates the labyrinth and causesvertigo and nystagmus if all the nerve pathwaysare intact.\nEndemic —Always there.\nParesthesia —An altered sensation often described\nas burning, tingling, or pin pricks.\nSyndrome —Common features of a disease or fea-\ntures that appear together often enough to suggestthey may represent a single, as yet unknown, dis-ease entity. When a syndrome is first identified, anattempt is made to define it as strictly as possible,even to the exclusion of some cases, in order toseparate out a pure enough sample to study. Thisprocess is most likely to identify a cause, a posi-tive method of diagnosis, and a treatment. Lateron, less typical cases can be considered.two patients have a greater degree of confusion and ataxia\n(loss of coordination). Type three patients were the mostaffected by joint pains, muscle pains, and extremity pares-thesias (unnatural sensations like burning or tingling inthe arms and legs). In each of the three types, researchersfound different but measurable impairments on objectivetesting of neurological function. The business of the ner-vous system is much more complex and subtle than otherbody functions. Measuring it requires equally complexeffort. The tests used in this study carefully measured andcompared localized nerve performance at several differ-ent tasks against the same values in normal subjects.Brain wave response to noise and touch, eye muscleresponse to spinning, and caloric testing (stimulation ofthe ear with warm and cold water, which causes vertigo)were clearly different between the normal and the testsubjects. The researchers concluded that there was “ageneralized injury to the nervous system.” Anotherresearch group concluded their study by stating that therewas “a spectrum of neurologic injury involving the cen-tral, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems.”\nDiagnosis\nUntil there is a clear definition of the disease, diag-\nnosis is primarily an exercise in identifying those GulfWar veterans who have undefined illness in an effort tolearn more about them and their symptoms. Both theDepartment of Defense and the Veterans Administrationcurrently have programs devoted to this problem. Boththe DOD’s Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Programand the V A’s Persian Gulf Registry provide free, in-depthmedical evaluations to Gulf War veterans and their fami-lies. In addition to providing individual veterans withcritical medical care, these organizations use the cumula-tive data from these programs to advance research onGulf War Syndrome itself.\nTreatment\nSpecific treatment awaits specific diagnosis and\nidentification of a causative agent. Meanwhile, veteranscan benefit from the wide variety of supportive and non-specific approaches to this and similar problems. Thereare many drugs available for symptomatic relief. Psycho-logical counseling by those specializing in this area canbe immensely beneficial, even life-saving for those con-templating suicide. Veterans’ benefits are available forthose who are impaired by their symptoms.\nAlternative treatment\nThe symptoms can be worked with using many\nmodalities of alternative health care. The key to workingsuccessfully with people living their lives with Gulf Warsyndrome is long-term, ongoing care, whether it be hyp-\nnotherapy ,acupuncture ,homeopathy ,nutrition , vita-\nmin/mineral therapy, or bodywork.\nExperimental treatment with antibiotics is advocat-\ned by some healthcare professionals who believe thatGulf War illness is related to a Mycoplasma fermentans\nbacterial infection. However, a conclusive link has notbeen clinically proven.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for Persian Gulf War veterans is\nunclear, but will hopefully improve as more informationis gathered about the illness. Gradual return to a func-tioning life may take many years of work and much help.It is important to note that even in the absence of an iden-tifiable and curable cause, recovery is possible.\nResources\nBOOKS\nIsselbacher, Kurt, et al., ed.

    "content": "Gynecomastia\nDefinition\nGyne refers to female, and mastia refers to the\nbreast. Gynecomastia is strictly a male disease and is anygrowth of the adipose (fatty) and glandular tissue in amale breast. Not all breast growth in men is consideredabnormal, just excess growth.\nCauses and symptoms\nBreast growth is directed exclusively by female hor-\nmones—estrogens. Although men have some estrogen intheir system, it is usually insufficient to cause much breastenlargement because it is counterbalanced by male hor-mones—androgens. Upsetting the balance, either by moreof one or less of the other, results in the male developingfemale characteristics, breast growth being foremost.\nAt birth both male and female infants will have little\nbreast buds from their mother’s hormones. These recedeuntil adolescence, when girls always, and boys some-times, have breast growth. At this time, the boy’s breastgrowth is minimal, often one-sided and temporary.KEY TERMS\nAndrogen —Male sex hormone.\nCirrhosis —Diffuse scarring caused by alcohol or\nchronic hepatitis often leading to liver failure.\nEstrogen —Sex hormone responsible for stimulat-\ning female sexual characteristics.\nKlinefelter syndrome —A condition in a male\ncharacterized by having an extra X (female) chro-mosome and suffering from infertility and gyneco-mastia.\nThyroid —A gland in the neck that makes thyroxin.\nThyroxin regulates the speed of metabolism.\nExtra or altered sex chromosomes can produce inter-\nsex problems of several kinds. Breast growth along withmale genital development is seen in Klinefelter syn-drome—the condition of having an extra X (female)chromosome—and a few other chromosomal anomalies.One of the several glands that produce hormones canmalfunction for reasons other than chromosomes. Failureof androgen production is as likely to produce gyneco-mastia as overabundant estrogen production. Testicularfailure and castration can also be a cause. Some cancersand some benign tumors can make estrogens. Lung can-\nceris known to increase estrogens.\nIf the hormone manufacturing organs are function-\ning properly, problems can still arise elsewhere. Theliver is the principle chemical factory in the body.Other organs like the thyroid and kidneys also effectchemical processes. If any of these organs are diseased,a chemical imbalance can result that alters the manu-facturing process. Men with cirrhosis of the liver will\noften develop gynecomastia from increased productionof estrogens.\nFinally, drugs can also cause breast enlargement.\nEstrogens are given to men to treat prostate cancer and\na few other diseases. Marijuana and heroin, along withsome prescription drugs, have estrogen effects in somemen. On the list are methyldopa (for blood pressure),cimetidine (for peptic ulcers), diazepam (Valium), anti-depressants, and spironolactone (a diuretic).\nDiagnosis\nCarefully feeling the area beneath the nipple of an\nadolescent boy with breast enlargement will reveal a dis-creet and sometimes tender lump the size of a fat nickelor quarter. For more serious gynecomastia, the underly-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1497Gynecomastiaing disease will require evaluation, if it is not already\nwell understood.\nTreatment\nThis condition is usually not treated. If it is the result\nof endocrine disease, hormone manipulations mayreduce the effects of the imbalance. There are a numberof medical and surgical interventions possible. Radiationof misbehaving organs and cancers is considered aneffective treatment.\nPrognosis\nThe progress of gynecomastia is determined by its\ncause.Resources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J.

    "title": "Hair transplantation",
    "content": "Hair transplantation\nDefinition\nHair transplantation is a surgical procedure used to\ntreat baldness or hair loss. Typically, tiny patches of scalpare removed from the back and sides of the head andimplanted in the bald spots in the front and top of the head.\nPurpose\nHair transplantation is a cosmetic procedure per-\nformed on men (and occasionally on women) who havesignificant hair loss, thinning hair, or bald spots wherehair no longer grows. In men, hair loss and baldness aremost commonly due to genetic factors (a tendencypassed on in families) and age. Male pattern baldness, inwhich the hairline gradually recedes to expose more andmore of the forehead, is the most common form. Menmay also experience a gradual thinning of hair at thecrown or very top of the skull. For women, hair loss ismore commonly due to hormonal changes and is morelikely to be a thinning of hair from the entire head. Anestimated 50,000 men get transplants each year. Trans-plants can also be done to replace hair lost due to burns ,\ninjury, or diseases of the scalp.\nPrecautions\nAlthough hair transplantation is a fairly simple pro-\ncedure, some risks are associated with any surgery. It isimportant to inform the physician about any medicationscurrently being used and about previous allergic reac-tions to drugs or anesthetic agents. Patients with bloodclotting disorders also need to inform their physicianbefore the procedure is performed.Description\nHair transplantation surgery is performed by a\nphysician in an office, clinic, or hospital setting. Eachsurgery lasts two to three hours during which approxi-mately 250 grafts will be transplanted. A moderatelybalding man may require up to 1,000 grafts to get goodcoverage of a bald area, so a series of surgeries sched-uled three to four months apart is usually required. Thepatient may be completely awake during the procedurewith just a local anesthetic drug applied to numb theareas of the scalp. Some patients may be given a drugto help them relax or may be given an anesthetic drugthat puts them to sleep.\nThe most common transplant procedure uses a thin\nstrip of hair and scalp from the back of the head. Thisstrip is cut into smaller clumps of five or six hairs. Tinycuts are made in the balding area of the scalp and aclump is implanted into each slit. The doctor performingthe surgery will attempt to recreate a natural lookinghairline along the forehead. Minigrafts, micrografts, orimplants of single hair follicles can be used to fill inbetween larger implant sites and can provide a more nat-ural-looking hairline. The implants will also be arrangedso that thick and thin hairs are interspersed and the hairwill grow in the same direction.\nAnother type of hair replacement surgery is called\nscalp reduction. This involves removing some of the skinfrom the hairless area and “stretching” some of the near-by hair-covered scalp over the cut-away area.\nHealth insurance will not pay for hair transplants\nthat are done for cosmetic reasons. Insurance may payfor hair replacement surgery to correct hair loss due toaccident, burn, or disease.\nIt is important to be realistic about what the final\nresult of a hair transplant will look like. This proceduredoes not create new hair, it simply redistributes the hairthat the patient still has. Some research has been con-ducted where chest hair has been transplanted to thebalding scalp, but this procedure is not widely practiced.H\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1499Preparation\nIt is important to find a respected, well-established,\nexperienced surgeon and discuss the expected resultsprior to the surgery. The patient may need blood tests tocheck for bleeding or clotting problems and may beasked not to take aspirin products before the surgery.\nThe type of anesthesia used will depend on how exten-sive the surgery will be and where it will be performed.The patient may be awake during the procedure, but maybe given medication to help them relax. A local anesthet-ic drug which numbs the area will be applied or injectedinto the skin at the surgery sites.\nAftercare\nThe area may need to be bandaged overnight. The\npatient can return to normal activities; however, stren-uous activities should be avoided in the first few daysafter the surgery. On rare occasions, the implants canbe “ejected” from the scalp during vigorous exercise .\nThere may be some swelling, bruising, headache , and\ndiscomfort around the graft areas and around the eyes.These symptoms can usually be controlled with a mildpain reliever like aspirin. Scabs may form at the graft\nsites and should not be scraped off. There may besome numbness at the sites, but it will diminish withintwo to three months.\nRisks\nAlthough there are rare cases of infection or scar-\nring, the major risk is probably that the grafted area doesnot look the way the patient expected it to look.Normal results\nThe transplanted hair will fall out within a few\nweeks, however, new hair will start to grow in the graftsites within about three months. A normal rate of hairgrowth is about 0.25–0.5 in (6–13 mm) per month.\nAbnormal results\nMajor complications as a result of hair transplanta-\ntion are extremely rare. Occasionally, a patient may haveproblems with delayed healing, infection, scarring, orrejection of the graft; but this is uncommon.\nResources\nBOOKS\nStrough, Dow B., and Robert S. Hamber, eds.

    "title": "Hairy cell leukemia",
    "content": "Hairy cell leukemia\nDefinition\nHairy cell leukemia is a disease in which a type of\nwhite blood cell called the lymphocyte, present in theblood and bone marrow, becomes malignant and prolifer-ates. It is called hairy cell leukemia because the cellshave tiny hair-like projections when viewed under themicroscope.\nDescription\nHairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare cancer . It was\nfirst described in 1958 as leukemic reticuloendotheliosis ,\nerroneously referring to a red blood cell becauseresearchers were unsure of the cell of origin. It becamemore easily identifiable in the 1970s. There are approxi-mately 600 new cases diagnosed every year in the UnitedStates, making up about 2% of the adult cases ofleukemia each year.\nHCL is found in cells located in the blood. There are\nthree types of cells found in the blood: the red blood cellsthat carry oxygen to all the parts of the body; the whiteblood cells that are responsible for fighting infection andprotecting the body from diseases; and the platelets thathelp in the clotting of blood. Hairy cell leukemia affects atype of white blood cell called the lymphocyte. Lympho-cytes are made in the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes,KEY TERMS\nAnesthetic agents —Medication or drugs that can\nbe injected with a needle or rubbed onto and areato make it numb before a surgical procedure.Anesthesia drugs may also be given by mouth,breathed in as a gas, or injected into a vein ormuscle to make a patient relaxed or unconscious.\nHair follicle —A tube-like indentation in the skin\nfrom which a single hair grows.\nMinigraft or micrograft —Transplantation of a\nsmall number of hair follicles, as few as one tothree hairs, into a transplant site.\nTransplantation —Surgically cutting out hair folli-\ncles and replanting them in a different spot on thehead.\nand other organs. It specifically affects B-lymphocytes,\nwhich mature in the bone marrow. However, extremelyrare variants of HCL have been discovered developingfrom T-lymphocytes, which mature in the thymus.\nWhen hairy cell leukemia develops, the white blood\ncells become abnormal both in the way they appear (byacquiring hairy projections) and in the way they act (byproliferating without the normal control mechanisms).Further, the cells tend to accumulate in the spleen, caus-ing it to become enlarged. The cells may also collect inthe bone marrow and prevent it from producing normalblood cells. As a result, there may not be enough normalwhite blood cells in the blood to fight infection.\nThe median age at which people develop HCL is 52\nyears. Though it occurs in all ages, HCL more commonlydevelops in the older population. Men are four timesmore likely to develop HCL than women. There havebeen reports of familial aggregation of disease, withhigher occurrences in Ashkenazi Jewish men. A potentialgenetic link is undergoing further investigation.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of hairy cell leukemia is not specifically\nknown. However, exposure to radiation is a known causeof leukemia in general. Familial involvement is anothertheory, suggesting that there is a genetic componentassociated with this disease.\nHCL is a chronic (slowly progressing) disease, and\nthe patients may not show any symptoms for many years.As the disease advances, the patients may suffer fromone or more of the following symptoms:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1501Hairy cell leukemia• weakness\n•fatigue\n• recurrent infections•fever\n• anemia\n• bruising•pain or discomfort in the abdominal area\n• weight loss (uncommon)\n• night sweats (uncommon)\nPain and discomfort are caused by an enlarged\nspleen, which results from the accumulation of the abnor-mal hairy cells in the spleen. Blood tests may show abnor-mal counts of all the different types of cells. This happensbecause the cancerous cells invade the bone marrow aswell and prevent it from producing normal blood cells.Because of the low white cell count in the blood, thepatient may have frequent infections. Fever often accom-panies the infections. The patient is most susceptible tobacterial infections, but infections of any kind are themajor cause of death . The low red cell count may cause\nanemia, fatigue, and weakness, and the low platelet\ncount may cause the person to bruise and bleed easily.\nDiagnosis\nWhen a patient suffers from the above symptoms,\nthe doctor will palpate the abdomen and may order scansto see if the spleen is enlarged (splenomegaly). Anenlarged spleen is present in 80% of patients. Anenlarged liver is less common, but can occur.\nIf the spleen is enlarged, the doctor may order several\nblood tests. In these tests, the total numbers of each of thedifferent types of blood cells (CBC) are reported. Sixty toeighty percent of patients suffer from pancytopenia, whichis a dramatic reduction in the number of red blood cells,\nwhite blood cells, and platelets circulating in the blood.\nIf the blood tests are abnormal, the doctor may order\na bone marrow aspiration and biopsy . In order to\nestablish a diagnosis, hairy cells must be present in thebone marrow.\nTreatment\nWhen physicians perform blood tests, they will\ndetermine the level of hemoglobin (the oxygen-trans-porting molecule of red blood cells). Serum hemoglobinlevels and the size of the spleen, which can be measuredon exam and by using an x ray, are proposed criteria fordetermining the stage of HCL. The following are thethree proposed stages and their criteria:\n• Stage I: Hemoglobin greater than 12 g/dL (1 g = approx-\nimately 0.02 pint and 1 dL = approximately 0.33 ounce)and spleen less than or equal to 10 cm (3.9 inches).\n• Stage II: Hemoglobin between 8.5 and 12 g/dL and\nspleen greater than 10 cm (3.9 inches).\n• Stage III: Hemoglobin less than 8.5 g/dL and spleen\ngreater than 10 cm (3.9 inches).\nSince there is generally no accepted staging system,\nanother method for evaluating the progression of HCL isto group patients into two categories: untreated HCL andprogressive HCL, in which hairy cells are present aftertherapy has been administered.\nSome people with hairy cell leukemia have very few\nor no symptoms at all, and it is reasonable to expect that10% of patients may not need any treatment. However, ifthe patient is symptomatic and needs intervention, HCLis especially responsive to treatment.\nThere are three main courses of treatment: chemo-\ntherapy ,splenectomy (surgical removal of the spleen),\nand immunotherapy. Once a patient meets treatment cri-teria, purine analogues, particularly the drugs, pento-statin and cladribine, are the first-line therapy. Pento-statin is administered at 5mg/m\n2for two days every other\nweek until total remission is achieved. Patients mayexperience side effects such as fever, nausea, vomiting,photosensitivity , and keratoconjuctivitis. However, fol-\nlow-up studies estimate a relapse-free survival rate at76%. Cladribine (2-CdA) taken at 0.1mg/kg/day forseven days also has an impressive response. Eighty-sixpercent of patients experience complete remission aftertreatment, while 16% experience partial remission. Feveris the principal side effect of 2-CdA.\nBiological therapy or immunotherapy, where the\nbody’s own immune cells are used to fight cancer, is alsobeing investigated in clinical trials for hairy cell leukemia.A substance called interferon that is produced by the white\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1502Hairy cell leukemia\nA magnified image of white blood cells with “hairy” projec-\ntions. (Photograph by M. Abbey. Photo Researchers, Inc. Repro-\nduced by permission.)blood cells of the body was the first systemic treatment\nthat showed consistent results in fighting HCL. The FDAapproved interferon-alpha (INF-alpha) to fight HCL. Themechanism by which INF-alpha works is not clearlyunderstood. However, it is known that interferon stimu-lates the body’s natural killer cells that are suppressed dur-ing HCL. The standard dosage is 2 MU/m\n2three times a\nweek for 12 months. Side effects include fever, myalgia,malaise, rashes , and gastrointestinal complaints.\nIf the spleen is enlarged, it may be removed in a sur-\ngical procedure known as splenectomy. This usually caus-es a remission of the disease. However, 50% of patientsthat undergo splenectomy require some type of systemictreatment such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy.Splenectomy is not the most widely used course of treat-ment as it was many years ago. Although the spleen is notan indispensable organ, it is responsible for helping thebody fight infection. Therefore, other therapies are pre-ferred in order to salvage the spleen and its functions.\nMost patients have excellent prognosis and can\nexpect to live 10 years or longer. The disease may remainsilent for years with treatment. Continual follow-up isnecessary to monitor the patient for relapse and deter-mine true cure rates.\nAlternative treatment\nMany individuals choose to supplement traditional\ntherapy with complementary methods. Often, thesemethods improve the tolerance of side effects and symp-toms as well as enrich the quality of life. The AmericanCancer Society recommends that patients talk to theirdoctor to ensure that the methods they are using are safe-ly supplementing traditional therapy. Some complemen-tary treatments include the following:\n• yoga\n• meditation• religious practices and prayer• music therapy• art therapy• massage therapy• aromatherapy\nPrevention\nSince the cause for the disease is unknown and there\nare no specific risk factors, there is no known prevention.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBast, Robert C.

    "title": "Hallucinations",
    "content": "Hallucinations\nDefinition\nHallucinations are false or distorted sensory experi-\nences that appear to be real perceptions. These sensoryimpressions are generated by the mind rather than by anyexternal stimuli, and may be seen, heard, felt, and evensmelled or tasted.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1503HallucinationsDescription\nA hallucination occurs when environmental, emo-\ntional, or physical factors such as stress , medication,\nextreme fatigue , or mental illness cause the mechanism\nwithin the brain that helps to distinguish conscious per-ceptions from internal, memory-based perceptions tomisfire. As a result, hallucinations occur during periodsof consciousness. They can appear in the form of visions,voices or sounds, tactile feelings (known as haptic hallu-cinations), smells, or tastes.\nPatients suffering from dementia and psychotic dis-\norders such as schizophrenia frequently experience hal-\nlucinations. Hallucinations can also occur in patientswho are not mentally ill as a result of stress overload orexhaustion, or may be intentionally induced through theuse of drugs, meditation , or sensory deprivation. A 1996\nreport, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry ,\nnoted that 37% of 4,972 people surveyed experiencedhypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur as aperson is falling to sleep). Hypnopomic hallucinations(hallucinations that occur just upon waking) were report-ed by 12% of the sample.\nCauses and symptoms\nCommon causes of hallucinations include:\n• Drugs. Hallucinogenics such as ecstasy (3,4-methyl-\nenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA), LSD (lyser-\ngic acid diethylamide , or acid), mescaline (3,4,5-\ntrimethoxyphenethylamine, or peyote), and psilocybin(4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine, or mush-rooms) trigger hallucinations. Other drugs such as mar-ijuana and PCP have hallucinatory effects. Certain pre-scription medications may also cause hallucinations. Inaddition, drug withdrawal may induce tactile and visualhallucinations; as in an alcoholic suffering from deliri-\numtremens (DTs).\n• Stress. Prolonged or extreme stress can impede thought\nprocesses and trigger hallucinations.\n• Sleep deprivation and/or exhaustion. Physical and emo-\ntional exhaustion can induce hallucinations by blurringthe line between sleep and wakefulness.\n• Meditation and/or sensory deprivation. When the brain\nlacks external stimulation to form perceptions, it maycompensate by referencing the memory and form hallu-cinatory perceptions. This condition is commonlyfound in blind and deaf individuals.\n• Electrical or neurochemical activity in the brain. A hal-\nlucinatory sensation—usually involving touch—calledan aura, often appears before, and gives warning of, amigraine. Also, auras involving smell and touch (tactile)\nare known to warn of the onset of an epileptic attack.\n• Mental illness. Up to 75% of schizophrenic patients\nadmitted for treatment report hallucinations.\n• Brain damage or disease. Lesions or injuries to the brain\nmay alter brain function and produce hallucinations.\nDiagnosis\nAside from hypnogogic and hypnopompic halluci-\nnations, more than one event suggests a person shouldseek evaluation. A general physician, psychologist, orpsychiatrist will try to rule out possible organic, environ-mental, or psychological causes through a detailed med-ical examination and social history. If a psychologicalcause such as schizophrenia is suspected, a psychologistwill typically conduct an interview with the patient andhis family and administer one of several clinical invento-ries, or tests, to evaluate the mental status of the patient.\nOccasionally, people who are in good mental health\nwill experience a hallucination. If hallucinations areinfrequent and transitory, and can be accounted for byshort-term environmental factors such as sleep depriva-tion or meditation, no treatment may be necessary. How-ever, if hallucinations are hampering an individual’s abil-ity to function, a general physician, psychologist, or psy-chiatrist should be consulted to pinpoint their source andrecommend a treatment plan.\nTreatment\nHallucinations that are symptomatic of a mental ill-\nness such as schizophrenia should be treated by a psy-chologist or psychiatrist. Antipsychotic medication suchas thioridazine (Mellaril), haloperidol (Haldol), chlorpro-mazine (Thorazine), clozapine (Clozaril), or risperidone(Risperdal) may be prescribed.\nPrognosis\nIn many cases, chronic hallucinations caused by\nschizophrenia or some other mental illness can be con-trolled by medication. If hallucinations persist, psy-chosocial therapy can be helpful in teaching the patientthe coping skills to deal with them. Hallucinations due tosleep deprivation or extreme stress generally stop afterthe cause is removed.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

    "content": "Hammertoe\nDefinition\nHammertoe is a condition in which the toe is bent in\na claw-like position. It can be present in more than onetoe but is most common in the second toe.\nDescription\nHammertoe is described as a deformity in which the\ntoes bend downward with the toe joint usually enlarged.Over time, the joint enlarges and stiffens as it rubsagainst shoes. Other foot structures involved include theoverlying skin and blood vessels and nerves connected tothe involved toes.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe shortening of tendons responsible for the con-\ntrol and movement of the affected toe or toes causehammertoe. Top portions of the toes become callusedKEY TERMS\nAura —A subjective sensation or motor phenome-\nnon that precedes and indicates the onset of aneurological episode, such as a migraine or anepileptic seizure.\nHypnogogic hallucination —A hallucination, such\nas the sensation of falling, that occurs at the onsetof sleep.\nHypnopompic hallucination —A hallucination\nthat occurs as a person is waking from sleep.\nSensory deprivation —A situation where an indi-\nvidual finds himself in an environment withoutsensory cues. Also, (used here) the act of shuttingone’s senses off to outside sensory stimuli toachieve hallucinatory experiences and/or toobserve the psychological results.\nfrom the friction produced against the inside of shoes.\nThis common foot problem often results from improp-er fit of footwear. This is especially the case with high-heeled shoes placing pressure on the front part of thefoot that compresses the smaller toes tightly together.The condition frequently stems from muscle imbal-ance, and usually leaves the affected individual withimpaired balance.\nDiagnosis\nA thorough medical history and physical exam by a\nphysician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis ofhammertoe and other foot conditions.

If surgery becomes necessary, surgical risks areminimal with the overall outcome providing good results.\nPrevention\nWearing comfortable shoes that fit well can prevent\nmany foot ailments. Foot width may increase with age.Feet should always be measured before buying shoes.The upper part of the shoes should be made of a soft,flexible material to match the shape of the foot. Shoesmade of leather can reduce the possibility of skin irrita-tions. Soles should provide solid footing and not be slip-pery. Thick soles lessen pressure when walking on hardsurfaces.

    "content": "Hand-foot-and-mouth disease\nDefinition\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease is an infection of\nyoung children in which characteristic fluid-filled blis-ters appear on the hands, feet, and inside the mouth.\nDescription\nCoxsackie viruses belong to a family of viruses\ncalled enteroviruses. These viruses live in the gastroin-testinal tract, and are therefore present in feces. Theycan be spread easily from one person to another whenpoor hygiene allows the virus within the feces to bepassed from person to person. After exposure to thevirus, development of symptoms takes only four to sixdays. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease can occur year-round, although the largest number of cases are in sum-mer and fall months.\nAn outbreak of hand-foot-and-mouth disease\noccurred in Singapore in 2000, with more than 1,000diagnosed cases, all in children, resulting in four deaths.A smaller outbreak occurred in Malaysia in 2000. In1998, a serious outbreak of enterovirus 71 in Taiwanresulted in more than one million cases of hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Of these, there were 405 severecases and 78 deaths, 71 of which were children youngerthan five years of age.\nHand-foot-and-mouth should not be confused with\nfoot and mouth disease, which infects cattle but isextremely rare in humans. An outbreak of foot andmouth disease swept through Great Britain and into otherparts of Europe and South America in 2001.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1506Hand-foot-and-mouth disease\nHammertoe most commonly affects the second toe which,\nas shown, often develops a corn over the deformity. (Photo-\ngraph by Dr. H.C. Robinson, Custom Medical Stock Photo.Reproduced by permission.)Causes and symptoms\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease is very common among\nyoung children, and often occurs in clusters of childrenwho are in daycare together. It is spread when poor hand-washing after a diaper change or contact with saliva (drool)allows the virus to be passed from one child to another.\nWithin about four to six days of acquiring the virus,\nan infected child may develop a relatively low-gradefever , ranging from 99–102°F (37.2–38.9°C). Other\nsymptoms include fatigue , loss of energy, decreased\nappetite, and a sore sensation in the mouth that may inter-fere with feeding. After one to two days, fluid-filledbumps (vesicles) appear on the inside of the mouth, alongthe surface of the tongue, on the roof of the mouth, and onthe insides of the cheeks. These are tiny blisters, about3–7 mm in diameter. Eventually, they may appear on thepalms of the hands and on the soles of the feet. Occasion-ally, these vesicles may occur in the diaper region.\nThe vesicles in the mouth cause the majority of dis-\ncomfort, and the child may refuse to eat or drink due topain . This phase usually lasts for an average of a week.\nAs long as the bumps have clear fluid within them, thedisease is at its most contagious. The fluid within thevesicles contains large quantities of the causative viruses.Extra care should be taken to avoid contact with this fluid.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made by most practitioners solely on\nthe basis of the unique appearance of blisters of themouth, hands, and feet, in a child not appearing very ill.\nTreatment\nThere are no treatments available to cure or decrease\nthe duration of the disease. Medications like aceta-KEY TERMS\nEnteroviruses —Viruses which live in the gastroin-\ntestinal tract.

It is impor-tant to try to encourage the child to take in adequateamounts of fluids, in the form of ice chips or popsicles ifother foods or liquids are too uncomfortable.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are no effective alternative treatments for\nhand-foot-and-mouth disease.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for a child with hand-foot-and-mouth\ndisease is excellent. The child is usually completely bet-ter within about a week of the start of the illness.\nPrevention\nPrevention involves careful attention to hygiene.\nThorough, consistent hand-washing practices, and dis-couraging the sharing of clothes, towels, and stuffed toysare all helpful. Virus continues to be passed in the fecesfor several weeks after infection, so good hygiene shouldbe practiced long after all signs of infection have passed.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMorag, Abraham, and Pearay L.

    "content": "Hantavirus infections\nDefinition\nHantavirus infection is caused by a group of viruses\nthat can infect humans with two serious illnesses: hemor-rhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and Han-\ntavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).\nDescription\nHantaviruses are found without causing symptoms\nwithin various species of rodents and are passed tohumans by exposure to the urine, feces, or saliva of thoseinfected rodents. Ten different hantaviruses have beenidentified as important in humans. Each is found in spe-cific geographic regions, and therefore is spread by dif-ferent rodent carriers. Further, each type of virus causes aslightly different form of illness in its human hosts:\n• Hantaan virus is carried by the striped field mouse, and\nexists in Korea, China, Eastern Russia, and the Balkans.Hantaan virus causes a severe form of hemorrhagicfever with renal syndrome (HFRS).\n• Puumula virus is carried by bank voles, and exists in\nScandinavia, western Russia, and Europe. Puumulavirus causes a milder form of HFRS, usually termednephropathia epidemica .\n• Seoul virus is carried by a type of rat called the Norway\nrat, and exists worldwide, but causes disease almostexclusively in Asia. Seoul virus causes a form of HFRSwhich is slightly milder than that caused by Hantaanvirus, but results in liver complications.\n• Prospect Hill virus is carried by meadow voles and\nexists in the United States, but has not been found tocause human disease.\n• Sin Nombre virus, the most predominant strain in the\nUnited States, is carried by the deer mouse. This viruswas responsible for severe cases of HPS that occurredin the Southwestern United States in 1993.• Black Creek Canal virus has been found in Florida. It is\npredominantly carried by cotton rats.\n• New York virus strain has been documented in New\nYork State. The vectors for this virus seem to be deermice and white-footed mice.\n• Bayou virus has been reported in Louisiana and Texas\nand is carried by the marsh rice rat.\n• Blue River virus has been found in Indiana and Okla-\nhoma and seems to be associated with the white-footedmouse.\n• Monongahela virus, discovered in 2000, has been\nfound in Pennsylvania and is transmitted by the white-footed mouse.\nCauses and symptoms\nHemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)\nHantaviruses that produce forms of hemorrhagic\nfever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cause a classic groupof symptoms, including fever, malfunction of the kid-neys, and low platelet count . Because platelets are blood\ncells important in proper clotting, low numbers of circu-lating platelets can result in spontaneous bleeding, orhemorrhage.\nPatients with HFRS have pain in the head, abdomen,\nand lower back, and may report bloodshot eyes and blurryvision. Tiny pinpoint hemorrhages, called petechiae, mayappear on the upper body and the soft palate in the mouth.The patient’s face, chest, abdomen, and back often appearflushed and red, as if sunburned.\nAfter about five days, the patient may have a sudden\ndrop in blood pressure; often it drops low enough tocause the clinical syndrome called shock . Shock is a\nstate in which blood circulation throughout the body isinsufficient to deliver proper quantities of oxygen.Lengthy shock can result in permanent damage to thebody’s organs, particularly the brain, which is very sensi-tive to oxygen deprivation.\nAround day eight of HFRS, kidney involvement\nresults in multiple derangements of the body chemistry.Simultaneously, the hemorrhagic features of the illnessbegin to cause spontaneous bleeding, as demonstrated bybloody urine, bloody vomit, and in very serious cases, brainhemorrhages with resulting changes in consciousness.\nDay eleven often brings further chemical derange-\nments, with associated confusion, hallucinations ,\nseizures, and lung complications. Those who survive thisfinal phase usually begin to turn the corner towardsrecovery at this time, although recovery takes approxi-mately six weeks.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1508Hantavirus infectionsHantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)\nHantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) develops in\nfour stages. They are:\n• The incubation period. This lasts from one to five\nweeks from exposure. Here, the patient may exhibit nosymptoms.\n• The prodrome, or warning signs, stage. The patient\nbegins with a fever, muscle aches, headache ,dizziness ,\nand abdominal pain and upset. Sometimes there is vom-iting and diarrhea.\n• The cardiopulmonary stage. The patient slips into this\nstage rapidly, sometimes within a day or two of initialsymptoms; sometimes as long as 10 days later. There isa drop in blood pressure, shock, and leaking of theblood vessels of the lungs, which results in fluid accu-mulation in the lungs, and subsequent shortness of\nbreath . The fluid accumulation can be so rapid and so\nsevere as to put the patient in respiratory failure with-\nin only a few hours. Some patients experience severeabdominal tenderness.\n• The convalescent stage. If the patient survives the respira-\ntory complications of the previous stage, there is a rapidrecovery, usually within a day or two. However, abnormalliver and lung functioning may persist for six months.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of infection by a hantavirus uses sero-\nlogic techniques. The patient’s blood is drawn, and theELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is done in alaboratory to identify the presence of specific immunesubstances (antibodies)—substances which an individual’sbody would only produce in response to the hantavirus.\nIt is very difficult to demonstrate the actual virus in\nhuman tissue, or to grow cultures of the virus within thelaboratory, so the majority of diagnostic tests use indirectmeans to demonstrate the presence of the virus.\nTreatment\nTreatment of hantavirus infections is primarily sup-\nportive, because there are no agents available to kill theviruses and interrupt the infection. Broad-spectrumantibiotics are given until the diagnosis is confirmed.\nSupportive care consists of providing treatment inresponse to the patient’s symptoms. Because both HFRSand HPS progress so rapidly, patients must be closelymonitored, so that treatment may be started at the firstsign of a particular problem. Low blood pressure is treat-ed with medications. Blood transfusions are given forboth hemorrhage and shock states. Hemodialysis is usedin kidney failure. (Hemodialysis involves mechanicallyKEY TERMS\nHemodialysis —A method of mechanically cleans-\ning the blood outside of the body, in order toremove various substances which would normallybe cleared by the kidneys.

Rapid respiratory assistance is critical,often requiring intubation.\nThe anti-viral agent ribavirin has been approved for\nuse in early treatment of hantavirus infections.\nPrognosis\nThe diseases caused by hantaviruses are extraordi-\nnarily lethal. About 6–15% of people who contractHFRS have died. Almost half of all people who contractHPS will die. It is essential that people living in areaswhere the hantaviruses exist seek quick medical treat-ment, should they begin to develop an illness that mightbe due to a hantavirus.\nPrevention\nThere are no immunizations currently available\nagainst any of the hantaviruses. The only forms of pre-vention involve rodent control within the community andwithin individual households. The following is a list ofpreventative measures:\n• Avoiding areas known to be infested by rodents is\nessential.\n• Keep a clean home and keep food in rodent-proof con-\ntainers.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1509Hantavirus infections• Dispose of garbage and empty pet food dishes at night.\n• Set rodent traps around baseboards and in tight places.\nDispose of dead animals with gloves and disinfect thearea with bleach.\n• Use rodenticide as necessary.\n• Seal any entry holes 0.25 inch wide or wider around\nfoundations with screen, cement, or metal flashing.\n• Clear brush and junk from house foundations.• Put metal flashing around house foundations.• Elevate hay, woodpiles, and refuse containers.• Air out all sealed outbuildings or cabins 30 minutes\nbefore cleaning for the season.\n• When camping, do not sleep on the bare ground; sleep\non a cot or in a tent with a floor.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarper, David R. and Andrea S.

    "title": "Haptoglobin test",
    "content": "Haptoglobin test\nDefinition\nThis test is done to help evaluate a person for\nhemolytic anemia .Purpose\nHaptoglobin is a blood protein made by the liver.\nThe haptoglobin levels decrease in hemolytic anemia.Hemolytic anemias include a variety of conditions that\nresult in hemolyzed, or burst, red blood cells.\nDecreased values can also indicate a slower type of\nred cell destruction unrelated to anemia. For example,destruction can be caused by mechanical heart valves orabnormal hemoglobin, such as sickle cell disease or tha-\nlassemia .\nHaptoglobin is known as an acute phase reactant. Its\nlevel increases during acute conditions such as infection,injury, tissue destruction, some cancers, burns , surgery, or\ntrauma. Its purpose is to remove damaged cells and debrisand rescue important material such as iron. Haptoglobinlevels can be used to monitor the course of these conditions.\nDescription\nHemoglobin is the protein in the red blood cell that\ncarries oxygen throughout the body. Iron is an essentialpart of hemoglobin; without iron, hemoglobin can notfunction. Haptoglobin’s main role is to save iron by attach-ing itself to any hemoglobin released from a red cell.\nWhen red blood cells are destroyed, the hemoglobin\nis released. Haptoglobin is always present in the bloodwaiting to bind to released hemoglobin. White bloodcells (called macrophages) bring the haptoglobin-hemo-globin complex to the liver, where the haptoglobin andhemoglobin are separated and the iron is recycled.\nIn hemolytic anemia, so many red cells are\ndestroyed that most of the available haptoglobin is need-ed to bind the released hemoglobin. The more severe thehemolysis, the less haptoglobin remains in the blood.\nHaptoglobin is measured in several different ways.\nOne way is called rate nephelometry. A person’s serum ismixed with a substance that will bind to haptoglobin. Theamount of bound haptoglobin is measured using a ratenephelometer, which measures the amount of light scat-tered by the bound haptoglobin. Another way of measur-ing haptoglobin is to measure it according to how muchhemoglobin it can bind.\nPreparation\nThis test requires 5 mL of blood. The person being\ntested should avoid taking oral contraceptives or andro-\ngens before this test. A healthcare worker ties a tourniqueton the person’s upper arm, locates a vein in the innerelbow region, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuumaction draws the blood through the needle into an attachedtube. Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1510Haptoglobin testAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site relieve discomfort.\nNormal results\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and test\nmethod used. Haptoglobin is not present in newborns atbirth, but develop adult levels by 6 months.\nAbnormal results\nDecreased haptoglobin levels usually indicates\nhemolytic anemia. Other causes of red cell destructionalso decrease haptoglobin: a blood transfusion reaction;\nmechanical heart valve; abnormally shaped red cells; orabnormal hemoglobin, such as thalassemia or sickle cellanemia.\nHaptoglobin levels are low in liver disease, because\nthe liver can not manufacture normal amounts of hapto-globin. Low levels may also indicate an inherited lack ofhaptoglobin, a condition found particularly in AfricanAmericans.\nHaptoglobin increases as a reaction to illness, trau-\nma, or rheumatoid disease. High haptoglobin valuesshould be followed-up with additional tests. Drugs canalso effect haptoglobin levels.\nNormal results vary widely from person to person.\nUnless the level is very high or very low, haptoglobinlevels are most valuable when the results of several testsdone on different days are compared.\nNancy J.

    "content": "Hartnup disease\nDefinition\nHartnup disease is an inherited nutritional disorder\nwith primary symptoms including a red, scaly rash andsensitivity to sunlight.\nDescription\nHartnup disease was first identified in the 1950s in\nthe Hartnup family in London. A defect in intestines andkidneys makes it difficult to break down and absorb pro-tein in the diet. This causes a condition very similar topellegra (niacin deficiency). The condition occurs inabout one of every 26,000 live births.\nCauses and symptoms\nHartnup disease is an in-born error of metabolism,\nthat is, a condition where certain nutrients cannot bedigested and absorbed properly. The condition ispassed on genetically in families. It occurs when a per-son inherits two recessive genes for the disease, onefrom each parent. People with Hartnup disease are notable to absorb some of the amino acids (the smallerbuilding blocks that make up proteins) in theirintestines. One of the amino acids that is not wellabsorbed is tryptophan, which the body uses to makeits own form of niacin.\nThe majority of people with this disorder do not\nshow any symptoms. About 10–20% of people withHartnup disease do have symptoms. The most prominentsymptom is a red, scaly rash that gets worse when thepatient is exposed to sunlight. Headache ,fainting , and\ndiarrhea may also occur. Mental retardation , cerebral\nataxia (muscle weakness), and delirium (a confused,\nagitated, delusional state) are some of the more seriouscomplications that can occur. Short stature has also beennoted in some patients. Although this is an inherited dis-ease, the development of symptoms depends on a varietyof factors including diet, environment, and other genetictraits controlling amino acid levels in the body. Symp-toms can be brought on by exposure to sunlight, fever ,\ndrugs, or other stresses. Poor nutrition frequently pre-\ncedes an attack of symptoms. The frequency of attacksusually decreases as the patient gets older.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1511Hartnup diseaseDiagnosis\nThe symptoms of this disease suggest a deficiency of\na B vitamin called niacin. A detailed diet history can beused to assess if there is adequate protein and vitamins in\nthe diet. The diagnosis of Hartnup disease is confirmed bya laboratory test of the urine which will contain an abnor-mally high amount of amino acids (aminoaciduria).\nTreatment\nThe vitamin niacin is given as a treatment for Hart-\nnup disease. The typical dosage ranges from 40–200 mgof nicotinamide (a form of niacin) per day to prevent pel-lagra-like symptoms. Some patients may require dietarysupplements of tryptophan.\nEating a healthy, high protein diet can relieve the\nsymptoms and prevent them from recurring.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for a healthy life is good once the\ncondition has been identified and treated.\nPrevention\nHartnup disease is an inherited condition.

    "title": "Hatha yoga",
    "content": "Hatha yoga\nDefinition\nHatha yoga is the most widely practiced form of\nyoga in America. It is the branch of yoga which concen-trates on physical health and mental well-being. Hathayoga uses bodily postures ( asanas ), breathing tech-\nniques ( pranayama ), and meditation (dyana ) with the\ngoal of bringing about a sound, healthy body and aclear, peaceful mind. There are nearly 200 hatha yogapostures, with hundreds of variations, which work tomake the spine supple and to promote circulation in allthe organs, glands, and tissues. Hatha yoga posturesalso stretch and align the body, promoting balance andflexibility.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1512Hatha yogaPurpose\nIn a celebrated 1990 study, Dr. Dean Ornish’s Pro-\ngram for Reversing Heart Disease (Random House), a\ncardiologist showed that yoga and meditation combinedwith a low-fat diet and group support could significantlyreduce the blockage of coronary arteries. Other studieshave shown yoga’s benefit in reducing stress-relatedproblems such as high blood pressure and cholesterol.Meditation has been adopted by medical schools and clin-ics as an effective stress management technique. Hatha\nyoga is also used by physical therapists to improve manyinjuries and disabilities, as the gentleness and adaptabilityof yoga make it an excellent rehabilitation program.\nYoga has been touted for its ability to reduce prob-\nlems with such varying conditions as asthma , backach-\nes, diabetes, constipation ,menopause ,multiple sclero-\nsis,varicose veins , and carpal tunnel syndrome . A veg-\netarian diet is the dietary goal of yoga, and this change oflifestyle has been shown to significantly increaselongevity and reduce heart disease.\nYoga as a daily exercise program can improve fitness,\nstrength, and flexibility. People who practice yoga correct-ly every day report that it can promote high levels of over-all health and energy. The mental component of yoga canclarify and discipline the mind, and yoga practitioners sayits benefits can permeate all facets of a person’s life andattitude, raising self-esteem and self-understanding.\nDescription\nOrigins\nYoga was developed in ancient India as far back as\n5,000 years ago; sculptures detailing yoga positions havebeen found in India which date back to 3000 \nB.C. Yoga is\nderived from a Sanskrit word which means “union.” Thegoal of classical yoga is to bring self-transcendence, orenlightenment, through physical, mental and spiritualhealth. Many people in the West mistakenly believe yogato be a religion, but its teachers point out that it is a sys-tem of living designed to promote health, peace of mind,and deeper awareness of ourselves. There are severalbranches of yoga, each of which is a different path andphilosophy toward self-improvement. Some of thesepaths include service to others, pursuit of wisdom, non-violence, devotion to God, and observance of spiritualrituals. Hatha yoga is the path which has physical healthand balance as a primary goal, for its practitionersbelieve that greater mental and spiritual awareness can bebrought about with a healthy and pure body.\nThe origins of hatha yoga have been traced back to\nthe eleventh century \nA.D. The Sanskrit word hameans\n“sun” and thameans “moon,” and thus hatha, or literallysun-moon yoga, strives to balance opposing parts of the\nphysical body, the front and back, left and right, top andbottom. Some yoga masters ( yogis ) claim that hatha yoga\nwas originally developed by enlightened teachers to helppeople survive during the Age of Kali, or the spiritualdark ages, in which Hindus believe we are now living.\nThe original philosophers of yoga developed it as an\neight-fold path to complete health. These eight stepsinclude moral and ethical considerations (such as hon-esty, non-aggression, peacefulness, non-stealing, gen-erosity, and sexual propriety), self-discipline (includingpurity, simplicity, devotion to God, and self-knowledge),posture, breath control, control of desires, concentration,meditation, and happiness. According to yogis, if thesesteps are followed diligently, a person can reach high lev-els of health and mental awareness.\nAs it has subsequently developed, hatha yoga has\nconcentrated mainly on two of the eight paths, breathingand posture. Yogis believe breathing to be the mostimportant metabolic function; we breathe roughly 23,000times per day and use about 4,500 gallons of air, whichincreases during exercise. Thus, breathing is extremelyimportant to health, and prana , or life-force, is found\nmost abundantly in the air and in the breath. If we arebreathing incorrectly, we are hampering our potential foroptimal health. Pranayama , literally the “science of\nbreathing” or “control of life force,” is the yogic practiceof breathing correctly and deeply.\nIn addition to breathing, hatha yoga utilizes asanas,\nor physical postures, to bring about flexibility, balanceand strength in the body. Each of these postures has adefinite form and precise steps for achieving the desiredposition and for exiting it. These postures, yogis main-tain, have been scientifically developed to increase circu-lation and health in all parts of the body, from the muscu-lar tissues to the glands and internal organs. Yogis claimthat although hatha yoga can make the body as strongand fit as any exercise program, its real benefits comeabout because it is a system of maintenance and balancefor the whole body.\nYoga was brought to America in the late 1800s,\nwhen Swami Vivekananda, an Indian yogi, presented alecture on yoga in Chicago. Hatha yoga captured theimagination of the Western mind, because accomplishedyogis could demonstrate incredible levels of fitness, flex-ibility, and control over their bodies and metabolism.Yoga has flourished in the West. Americans have broughtto yoga their energy and zest for innovation, which trou-bles some Indian yogis and encourages others, as newvariations and schools of yoga have developed. Forinstance, power yoga is a recent Americanized version ofyoga which takes hatha yoga principles and speeds them\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1513Hatha yogaup into an extremely rigorous aerobic workout, and many\nstrict hatha yoga teachers oppose this sort of change totheir philosophy. Other variations of hatha yoga in Amer-ica now include Iyengar, Ashtanga, Kripalu, Integral,Viniyoga, Hidden Language, and Bikram yoga, to namea few. Sivananda yoga was practiced by Lilias Folen,who was responsible for introducing many Americans toyoga through public television.\nIyengar yoga was developed by B.K.S. Iyengar, who\nis widely accepted as one of the great living yogis. Iyen-gar uses classical hatha yoga asanas and breathing tech-niques, but emphasizes great precision and strict form inthe poses, and uses many variations on a few postures.Iyengar allows the use of props such as belts, ropes,chairs, and blocks to enable students to get into posturesthey otherwise couldn’t. In this respect, Iyengar yoga isgood for physical therapy because it assists in the manip-ulation of inflexible or injured areas.\nAshtanga yoga, made popular by yogi K. Patabhi\nJois, also uses hatha yoga asanas, but places an emphasison the sequences in which these postures are performed.Ashtanga routines often unfold like long dances withmany positions done quickly one after the other. Ashtan-ga is thus a rigorous form of hatha yoga, and sometimescan resemble a difficult aerobic workout. Ashtangateachers claim that this form of yoga uses body heat,sweating, and deep breathing to purify the body.\nKripalu yoga uses hatha yoga positions but empha-\nsizes the mental and emotional components of eachasana. Its teachers believe that tension and long-heldemotional problems can be released from the body by adeep and meditative approach to the yoga positions. Inte-gral yoga seeks to combine all the paths of yoga, and isgenerally more meditative than physical, emphasizingspirituality and awareness in everyday life.

It emphasizes the symbol-ic and psychological parts of yoga postures and tech-niques. Its students are encouraged to write journals andparticipate in group discussions as part of their practice.Bikram yoga has become very popular in the late 1990s,as its popular teacher, Bikram Choudury, began teachingin Beverly Hills and has been endorsed by many famouscelebrities. Bikram yoga uses the repetition of 26 specificposes and two breathing techniques to stretch and tonethe whole body.\nA hatha yoga routine consists of a series of physical\npostures and breathing techniques. Routines can takeanywhere from 20 minutes to two hours, depending onthe needs and ability of the practitioner. Yoga shouldalways be adapted to one’s state of health; that is, a short-er and easier routine should be used when a person isfatigued. Yoga is ideally practiced at the same time everyday, to encourage the discipline of the practice. It can bedone at any time of day; some prefer it in the morning asa wake-up routine, while others like to wind down andde-stress with yoga at the end of the day.\nYoga asanas consist of three basic movements: back-\nward bends, forward bends, and twisting movements.These postures are always balanced; a back bend should befollowed with a forward bend, and a leftward movementshould be followed by one to the right. Diaphragm breath-ing is important during the poses, where the breath beginsat the bottom of the lungs. The stomach should move out-ward with the inhalation and relax inward during exhala-tion. The breath should be through the nose at all times dur-ing hatha asanas. Typically, one inhales during backwardbends and exhales during forward bending movements.\nThe mental component in yoga is as important as the\nphysical movements. Yoga is not a competitive sport, but ameans to self-awareness and self-improvement. An atti-tude of attention, care, and non-criticism is important; lim-itations should be acknowledged and calmly improved.Patience is important, and yoga stretches should be slowand worked up to gradually. The body should be workedwith, and never against, and a person should never overex-ert. A yoga stretch should be done only so far as properform and alignment of the whole body can be maintained.Some yoga stretches can be uncomfortable for beginners,and part of yoga is learning to distinguish between sensa-tions that are beneficial and those that can signal potentialinjury. A good rule is that positions should be stoppedwhen there is sharp pain in the joints, muscles, or tendons.\nPreparations\nAll that is needed to perform hatha yoga is a flat floor\nand adequate space for stretching out. A well-ventilated\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1514Hatha yogaspace is preferable, for facilitating proper breathing tech-\nnique. Yoga mats are available which provide non-slipsurfaces for standing poses. Loose, comfortable clothingshould be worn. Yoga should be done on an empty stom-ach; a general rule is to wait three hours after a meal.\nYoga is an exercise that can be done anywhere and\nrequires no special equipment. Yoga uses only gravityand the body itself as resistance, so it is a low-impactactivity excellent for those who don’t do well with othertypes of exercise. The mental component of yoga canappeal to those who get bored easily with exercise. Bythe same token, yoga can be a good stress managementtool for those who prefer movement to sitting meditation.\nPrecautions\nAs with any exercise program, people should check\nwith their doctors before starting yoga practice for thefirst time. Those with medical conditions, injuries orspinal problems should find a yoga teacher familiar withtheir conditions before beginning yoga.

    "title": "Head and neck cancer",
    "content": "Head and neck cancer\nDefinition\nThe term head and neck cancers refers to a group of\ncancers found in the head and neck region. This includestumors found in:\n• The oral cavity (mouth). The lips, the tongue, the teeth,\nthe gums, the lining inside the lips and cheeks, the floorof the mouth (under the tongue), the roof of the mouthand the small area behind the wisdom teeth are allincluded in the oral cavity.\n• The oropharynx (which includes the back one-third of\nthe tongue, the back of the throat and the tonsils).\n• Nasopharynx (which includes the area behind the nose).• Hypopharynx (lower part of the throat).• The larynx (voice box, located in front of the neck, in\nthe region of the Adam’s apple). In the larynx, the can-\ncercan occur in any of the three regions: the glottis\n(where the vocal cords are); the supraglottis (the areaabove the glottis), and the subglottis (the area that con-nects the glottis to the windpipe).\nThe most frequently occurring cancers of the head\nand neck area are oral cancers and laryngeal cancers.Almost half of all the head and neck cancers occur in theoral cavity, and a third of the cancers are found in the lar-ynx. By definition, the term “head and neck cancers”usually excludes tumors that occur in the brain.\nDescription\nHead and neck cancers involve the respiratory tract\nand the digestive tract; and they interfere with the func-tions of eating and breathing. Laryngeal cancers affect\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1515Head and neck cancerspeech. Loss of any of these functions is significant.\nHence, early detection and appropriate treatment of headand neck cancers is of utmost importance.\nRoughly 10% of all cancers are related to the head\nand the neck. It is estimated that more than 55,000 Ameri-cans will develop cancer of the head and neck in 1998,and nearly 13,000 will die from the disease. The Ameri-can Cancer Society estimates that in 1998, approximately,11,100 new cases of laryngeal cancer alone will be diag-\nnosed and 4,300 people will die of this disease. Oral can-cer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States.Approximately 40,000 new cases are diagnosed each yearand it causes at least 8,000 deaths. Among the major can-cers, the survival rate for head and neck cancers is one ofthe poorest. Less than 50% of the patients survive fiveyears or more after initial diagnosis. This is because theearly signs of head and neck cancers are frequentlyignored. Hence, when it is first diagnosed, it is often in anadvanced stage and not very amenable to treatment.\nThe risk for both oral cancer and laryngeal cancer\nseems to increase with age. Most of the cases occur inindividuals over 40 years of age, the average age at diag-nosis being 60. While oral cancer strikes men twice asoften as it does women, laryngeal cancer is four timesmore common in men than in women. Both diseases aremore common in black Americans than among whites.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough the exact cause for these cancers is\nunknown, tobacco is regarded as the single greatest riskfactor: 75–80% of the oral and laryngeal cancer casesoccur among smokers. Heavy alcohol use has also beenincluded as a risk factor. A combination of tobacco andalcohol use increases the risk for oral cancer by 6–15times more than for users of either substance alone. Inrare cases, irritation to the lining of the mouth, due tojagged teeth or ill-fitting dentures, has been known tocause oral cancer. Exposure to asbestos appears toincrease the risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nIn the case of lip cancer, just like skin cancer, expo-\nsure to sun over a prolonged period has been shown toincrease the risk. In the Southeast Asian countries (Indiaand Sri Lanka), chewing of betel nut has been associatedwith cancer of the lining of the cheek. An increased inci-dence of nasal cavity cancer has been observed amongfurniture workers, probably due to the inhalation of wooddust. A virus (Epstein-Barr) has been shown to causenasopharyngeal cancer.\nHead and neck cancers are one of the easiest to\ndetect. The early signs can be both seen and felt. Thesigns and symptoms depend on the location of the cancer:• Mouth and oral cavity: a sore that does not heal within\ntwo weeks, unusual bleeding from the teeth or gums, awhite or red patch in the mouth, a lump or thickening inthe mouth, throat, or tongue.\n• Larynx: persistent hoarseness or sore throat , difficulty\nbreathing, or pain .\n• Hypopharynx and oropharynx: difficulty in swallowing\nor chewing food, ear pain.\n• Nose, sinuses, and nasopharyngeal cavity: pain, bloody\ndischarges from the nose, blocked nose, and frequentsinus infections that do not respond to standard antibi-\notics .\nWhen detected early and treated appropriately, head\nand neck cancers have an excellent chance of being curedcompletely.\nDiagnosis\nSpecific diagnostic tests used depend on the location\nof the cancer. The standard tests are:\nPhysical examination\nThe first step in diagnosis is a complete and thor-\nough examination of the oral and nasal cavity, using mir-rors and other visual aids. The tongue and the back of thethroat are examined as well. Any suspicious lookinglumps or lesions are examined with fingers (palpation).In order to look inside the larynx, the doctor may some-times perform a procedure known as laryngoscopy . In\nindirect laryngoscopy, the doctor looks down the throatwith a small, long handled mirror. Sometimes the doctorinserts a lighted tube (laryngoscope or a fiberoptic scope)through the patient’s nose or mouth. As the tube goesdown the throat, the doctor can observe areas that cannotbe seen by a simple mirror. This procedure is called adirect laryngoscopy. Sometimes patients may be given amild sedative to help them relax, and a local anesthetic toease any discomfort.\nBlood tests\nThe doctor may order blood or other immunological\ntests. These tests are aimed at detecting antibodies to theEpstein-Barr virus, which has been known to cause can-cer of the nasopharynx.\nImaging tests\nX rays of the mouth, the sinuses, the skull, and the\nchest region may be required. A computed tomographyscan (CT scan), a procedure in which a computer takes aseries of x ray pictures of areas inside the body, may bedone. Ultrasonograms (images generated using sound\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1516Head and neck cancerwaves) or an MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) a pro-\ncedure in which a picture is created using magnets linkedto a computer), are alternate procedures which a doctormay have done to get detailed pictures of the areas insidethe body.\nBiopsy\nWhen a sore does not heal or a suspicious patch or\nlump is seen in the mouth, larynx, nasopharynx, orthroat, a biopsy may be performed to rule out the possi-bility of cancer. The biopsy is the most definitive diag-nostic tool for detecting the cancer. If cancerous cells aredetected in the biopsied sample, the doctor may performmore extensive tests in order to find whether, and towhere, the cancer may have spread.\nTreatment\nThe cancers can be treated successfully if diagnosed\nearly. The choice of treatment depends on the size of thetumor, its location, and whether it has spread to otherparts of the body.\nIn the case of lip and mouth cancers, sometimes\nsurgery is performed to remove the cancer. Radiation\ntherapy , which destroys the cancerous cells, is also one\nof the primary modes of treatment, and may be usedalone or in combination with surgery. If lip surgery isdrastic, rehabilitation cosmetic or reconstructive\nsurgery may have to be considered.\nCancers of the nasal cavity are often diagnosed late\nbecause they have no specific symptoms in their earlystages, or the symptoms may just resemble chronicsinusitis . Hence, treatment is often complex, involving a\ncombination of radiotherapy and surgery. Surgery is gen-erally recommended for small tumors. If the cancer can-not be removed by surgery, radiotherapy is used alone.\nTreatment of oropharynx cancers (cancers that are\neither in the back of the tongue, the throat, or the tonsils)generally involves radiation therapy and/or surgery. Afteraggressive surgery and radiation, rehabilitation is oftennecessary and is an essential part of the treatment. Thepatient may experience difficulties with swallowing,chewing, and speech and may require a team of healthcare workers, including speech therapists, prosthodon-tists, occupational therapists etc.\nCancers of the nasopharynx are different from the\nother head and neck cancers in that there does not appearto be any association between alcohol and tobacco useand the development of the cancer. In addition, the inci-dence is seen primarily in two age groups: young adultsand 50–70 year-olds. The Epstein-Barr virus has beenimplicated as the causative agent in most patients. While80–90% of small tumors are curable by radiation therapy,\nadvanced tumors that have spread to the bone and cranialnerves are difficult to control. Surgery is not very helpfuland, hence, is rarely attempted. Radiation remains theonly treatment of choice to treat the cancer that hasmetastasized (traveled) to the lymph nodes in the neck.\nIn the case of cancer of the larynx, radiotherapy is\nthe first choice to treat small lesions. This is done inan attempt to preserve the voice. If the cancer recurslater, surgery may be attempted. If the cancer is limit-ed to one of the two vocal cords, laser excisionsurgery is used. In order to treat advanced cancers, acombination of surgery and radiation therapy is oftenused. Because the chances of a cure in the case ofadvanced laryngeal cancers are rather low with currenttherapies, the patient may be advised to participate inclinical trials so they may get access to new experi-mental drugs and procedures, such as chemotherapy ,\nthat are being evaluated.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1517Head and neck cancer\nA specimen of a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue\nand jaw. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permis-\nsion.)When only part of the larynx is removed, a relatively\nslight change in the voice may occur—the patient maysound slightly hoarse. However, in a total laryngectomy ,\nthe entire voice box is removed. The patients then have tore-learn to speak using different approaches, such asesophageal speech, tracheo-esophageal (TE) speech, orby means of an artificial larynx.\nIn esophageal speech, the patients are taught how to\ncreate a new type of voice by forcing air through theesophagus (food pipe) into the mouth. This method has ahigh success rate of approximately 65% and patients areeven able to go back to jobs that require a high level ofverbal communication, such as telephone operators andsalespersons.\nIn the second approach, TE speech, a small opening,\ncalled a fistula, is created surgically between the trachea(breathing tube to the lungs) and the esophagus (tube intothe stomach) to carry air into the throat. A small tube,known as the “voice prosthesis,” is placed in the openingof the fistula to keep it open and to prevent food and liq-uid from going down into the trachea. In order to talk, thestoma (or the opening made at the base of the neck) mustbe covered with one’s thumb during exhalation. As theair is forced out from the trachea into the esophagus, itvibrates the walls of the esophagus. This produces asound that is then modified by the lips and tongue to pro-duce normal sounding speech.KEY TERMS\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and microscopic\nexamination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.\nChemotherapy —Treatment of cancer with synthetic\ndrugs that destroy the tumor either by inhibiting thegrowth of the cancerous cells or by killing the can-cer cells.\nClinical trials —Highly regulated and carefully con-\ntrolled patient studies, where either new drugs totreat cancer or novel methods of treatment areinvestigated.\nComputerized tomography scan (CT scan) —A\nmedical procedure where a series of X-rays aretaken and put together by a computer in order toform detailed pictures of areas inside the body.\nLaryngoscopy —A medical procedure that uses flex-\nible, lighted, narrow tubes inserted through themouth or nose to examine the larynx and otherareas deep inside the neck.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) —A medical\nprocedure used for diagnostic purposes where pic-tures of areas inside the body can be created usinga magnet linked to a computer.\nRadiation therapy —Treatment using high energy\nradiation from x-ray machines, cobalt, radium, orother sources.\nStoma —When the entire larynx must be surgically\nremoved, an opening is surgically created in theneck so that the windpipe can be brought out to theneck. This opening is called the stoma.\nUltrasonogram —A procedure where high-frequen-\ncy sound waves that cannot be heard by humanears are bounced off internal organs and tissues.These sound waves produce a pattern of echoeswhich are then used by the computer to createsonograms, or pictures of areas inside the body.\nX rays —High energy radiation used in high doses,\neither to diagnose or treat disease.\nIn the third approach, an artificial larynx, a battery\ndriven vibrator, is placed on the outside of the throat.Sound is created as air passes through the stoma (openingmade at the base of the neck) and the mouth forms words.\nPrognosis\nOral Cavity\nWith early detection and immediate treatment, sur-\nvival rates can be dramatically improved. For lip and oralcancer, if detected at its early stages, almost 80% of thepatients survive five years or more. However, when diag-nosed at the advanced stages, the five year survival ratedrops to a mere 18%.\nNose and sinuses\nCancers of the nasal cavity often go undetected until\nthey reach an advanced stage. If diagnosed at the earlystages, the five-year survival rates are 60–70%. However,if cancers are more advanced, only 10–30% of thepatients survive five years or more.\nOropharynx\nIn cancer of the oropharynx, 60–80% of the patients\nsurvive five years or more if the cancer is detected in the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1518Head and neck cancerearly stages. As the cancer advances, the survival rate\ndrops to 15–30%.\nNasopharynx\nPatients who are diagnosed with early stage cancers\nthat have originated in the nasopharynx have an excellentchance of a complete cure (almost 95%). Unfortunately,most of the time, the patients are in an advanced stage atthe time of initial diagnosis. With the new chemotherapydrugs, the five year survival rate has improved and5–40% of the patients survive five years or longer.\nLarynx\nSmall cancers of the larynx have an excellent five-\nyear survival rate of 75–95%. However, as with most ofthe head and neck cancers, the survival rates drop dra-matically as the cancer advances. Only 15–25% of thepatients survive five years or more after being initiallydiagnosed with advanced laryngeal cancer.\nPrevention\nRefraining from the use of all tobacco products (cig-\narettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco), consum-ing alcohol in moderation, and practicing good oral\nhygiene are some of the measures that one can take to\nprevent head and neck cancers. Since there is an associa-tion between excessive exposure to the sun and lip can-cer, people who spend a lot of time outdoors in the sunshould protect themselves from the sun’s harmful rays.Regular physical examinations, or mouth examination bythe patient himself, or by the patient’s doctor or dentist,can help detect oral cancer in its very early stages.\nSince working with asbestos has been shown to\nincrease one’s risk of getting cancer of the larynx,asbestos workers should follow safety rules to avoidinhaling asbestos fibers. Also, malnutrition and vitamin\ndeficiencies have been shown to have some associationwith an increased incidence of head and neck cancers.The American Cancer Society, therefore, recommendseating a healthy diet, consisting of at least five servingsof fruits and vegetables every day, and six servings offood from other plant sources such as cereals, breads,grain products, rice, pasta and beans. Reducing one’sintake of high-fat food from animal sources is advised.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, ed., et al. Merck Manual of Diagnosis and\nTherapy. 16th ed.

    "title": "Head injury",
    "content": "Head injury\nDefinition\nInjury to the head may damage the scalp, skull or\nbrain. The most important consequence of head trauma istraumatic brain injury. Head injury may occur either as aclosed head injury, such as the head hitting a car’s wind-shield, or as a penetrating head injury, as when a bulletpierces the skull. Both may cause damage that rangesfrom mild to profound. Very severe injury can be fatalbecause of profound brain damage.\nDescription\nExternal trauma to the head is capable of damaging\nthe brain, even if there is no external evidence of dam-age. More serious injuries can cause skull fracture, bloodclots between the skull and the brain, or bruising andtearing of the brain tissue itself.\nInjuries to the head can be caused by traffic acci-\ndents, sports injuries , falls, workplace accidents,\nassaults, or bullets. Most people have had some type ofhead injury at least once in their lives, but rarely do theyrequire a hospital visit.\nHowever, each year about two million people suffer\nfrom a more serious head injury, and up to 750,000 ofthem are severe enough to require hospitalization. Braininjury is most likely to occur in males between ages 15and 24, usually as a result of car and motorcycle acci-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1519Head injurydents. About 70% of all accidental deaths are due to\nhead injuries, as are most of the disabilities that occurafter trauma.\nA person who has had a head injury and who is\nexperiencing the following symptoms should seek med-ical care immediately:\n• serious bleeding from the head or face\n• loss of consciousness, however brief\n• confusion and lethargy• lack of pulse or breathing• clear fluid drainage from the nose or ear\nCauses and symptoms\nA head injury may cause damage both from the\ndirect physical injury to the brain and from secondaryfactors, such as lack of oxygen, brain swelling, and dis-turbance of blood flow. Both closed and penetrating headinjuries can cause swirling movements throughout thebrain, tearing nerve fibers and causing widespread bleed-ing or a blood clot in or around the brain. Swelling mayraise pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure) andmay block the flow of oxygen to the brain.\nHead trauma may cause a concussion , in which\nthere is a brief loss of consciousness without visiblestructural damage to the brain. In addition to loss of con-sciousness, initial symptoms of brain injury may include:\n• memory loss and confusion• vomiting•dizziness\n• partial paralysis or numbness\n• shock\n• anxiety\nAfter a head injury, there may be a period of\nimpaired consciousness followed by a period of confu-sion and impaired memory with disorientation and abreakdown in the ability to store and retrieve new infor-mation. Others experience temporary amnesia following\nhead injury that begins with memory loss over a periodof weeks, months, or years before the injury (retrogradeamnesia). As the patient recovers, memory slowlyreturns. Post-traumatic amnesia refers to loss of memoryfor events during and after the accident.\nEpilepsy occurs in 2–5% of those who have had a\nhead injury; it is much more common in people whohave had severe or penetrating injuries. Most cases ofepilepsy appear right after the accident or within the firstyear, and become less likely with increased time follow-ing the accident.Closed head injury\nClosed head injury refers to brain injury without any\npenetrating injury to the brain. It may be the result of adirect blow to the head; of the moving head being rapidlystopped, such as when a person’s head hits a windshieldin a car accident; or by the sudden deceleration of thehead without its striking another object. The kind ofinjury the brain receives in a closed head injury is deter-mined by whether or not the head was unrestrained uponimpact and the direction, force, and velocity of the blow.If the head is resting on impact, the maximum damagewill be found at the impact site. A moving head willcause a “contrecoup injury” where the brain damageoccurs on the side opposite the point of impact, as aresult of the brain slamming into that side of the skull. Aclosed head injury also may occur without the head beingstruck, such as when a person experiences whiplash .\nThis type of injury occurs because the brain is of a differ-ent density than the skull, and can be injured when deli-cate brain tissues hit against the rough, jagged inner sur-face of the skull.\nPenetrating head injury\nIf the skull is fractured, bone fragments may be dri-\nven into the brain. Any object that penetrates the skullmay implant foreign material and dirt into the brain,leading to an infection.\nSkull fracture\nA skull fracture is a medical emergency that must be\ntreated promptly to prevent possible brain damage. Suchan injury may be obvious if blood or bone fragments arevisible, but it’s possible for a fracture to have occurredwithout any apparent damage. A skull fracture should besuspected if there is:\n• blood or clear fluid leaking from nose or ears\n• unequal pupil size\n• bruises or discoloration around the eyes or behind the\nears\n• swelling or depression of the part of the head\nIntracranial hemorrhage\nBleeding (hemorrhage) inside the skull may accom-\npany a head injury and cause additional damage to thebrain. A blood clot (hematoma) may occur if a blood ves-sel between the skull and the brain ruptures; when theblood leaks out and forms a clot, it can press againstbrain tissue, causing symptoms from a few hours to a fewweeks after the injury. If the clot is located between thebones of the skull and the covering of the brain (dura), it\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1520Head injuryis called an epidural hematoma. If the clot is between the\ndura and the brain tissue itself, the condition is called asubdural hematoma . In other cases, bleeding may occur\ndeeper inside the brain. This condition is called intracere-bral hemorrhage or intracerebral contusion (from theword for bruising).\nIn any case, if the blood flow is not stopped, it can\nlead to unconsciousness and death . The symptoms of\nbleeding within the skull include:\n• nausea and vomiting\n•headache\n• loss of consciousness\n• unequal pupil size\n• lethargy\nPostconcussion syndrome\nIf the head injury is mild, there may be no symptoms\nother than a slight headache, or there also may be confu-sion, dizziness, and blurred vision. While the head injurymay seem to have been quite mild, in many cases symp-toms persist for days or weeks. Up to 60% of patientswho sustain a mild brain injury continue to experience arange of symptoms called “postconcussion syndrome,”as long as six months or a year after the injury.\nThe symptoms of postconcussion syndrome can\nresult in a puzzling interplay of behavioral, cognitive,and emotional complaints that can be difficult to diag-nose, including:\n• headache\n• dizziness\n• mental confusion\n• behavior changes\n• memory loss• cognitive deficits\n• depression\n• emotional outbursts\nDiagnosis\nThe extent of damage in a severe head injury can be\nassessed with computed tomography scan (CT scan),magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission\ntomography (PET ) scans, electroencephalograms\n(EEG), and routine neurological and neuropsychologicalevaluations.\nDoctors use the Glasgow Coma Scale to evaluate\nthe extent of brain damage based on observing a patient’sability to open his or her eyes, respond verbally, andrespond to stimulation by moving (motor response).\nPatients can score from three to 15 points on this scale.People who score below eight when they are admittedusually have suffered a severe brain injury and will needrehabilitative therapy as they recover. In general, higherscores on the Glasgow Coma Scale indicate less severebrain injury and a better prognosis for recovery.\nPatients with a mild head injury who experience\nsymptoms are advised to seek out the care of a specialist;unless a family physician is thoroughly familiar withmedical literature in this newly emerging area, expertswarn that there is a good chance that patient complaintsafter a mild head injury will be downplayed or dismissed.In the case of mild head injury or postconcussion syn-drome, CT and MRI scans, electroencephalograms(EEG), and routine neurological evaluations all may benormal because the damage is so subtle. In many cases,these tests can’t detect the microscopic damage that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1521Head injury\nA three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan of a\nhuman skull showing a depressed skull fracture above theright eye. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by per-\nmission.)occurs when fibers are stretched in a mild, diffuse injury.\nIn this type of injury, the axons lose some of their cover-ing and become less efficient. This mild injury to thewhite matter reduces the quality of communicationbetween different parts or the brain. A PET scan, whichevaluates cerebral blood flow and brain metabolism, maybe of help in diagnosing mild head injury, although this isstill largely considered to be an experimental procedure.\nPatients with continuing symptoms after a mild head\ninjury should call a local chapter of a head-injury foun-dation that can refer patients to the best nearby expert.\nTreatment\nIf a concussion, bleeding inside the skull, or skull\nfracture is suspected, the patient should be kept quiet in adarkened room, with head and shoulders raised slightlyon pillow or blanket.\nAfter initial emergency treatment, a team of special-\nists may be needed to evaluate and treat the problemsthat result. A penetrating wound may require surgery.Those with severe injuries or with a deteriorating level ofconsciousness may be kept hospitalized for observation.If there is bleeding inside the skull, the blood may needto be surgically drained; if a clot has formed, it may needto be removed.

Supportive care and specific treatments may be\nrequired if the patient experiences further complications.People who experience seizures, for example, may begiven anticonvulsant drugs , and people who develop\nfluid on the brain ( hydrocephalus ) may have a shunt\ninserted to drain the fluid.\nIn the event of long-term disability as a result of\nhead injury, there are a variety of treatment programsavailable, including long-term rehabilitation , coma\ntreatment centers, transitional living programs, behaviormanagement programs, life-long residential or day treat-ment programs and independent living programs.\nPrognosis\nPrompt, proper diagnosis and treatment can help alle-\nviate some of the problems after a head injury. However, itis usually difficult to predict the outcome of a brain injuryin the first few hours or days; a patient’s prognosis maynot be known for many months or even years.\nThe outlook for someone with a minor head injury is\ngenerally good, although recovery may be delayed andsymptoms such as headache, dizziness, and cognitiveproblems can persist for up to a year or longer after anaccident. This can limit a person’s ability to work andcause strain in personal relationships.\nSerious head injuries can be devastating, producing\npermanent mental and physical disability. Epilepticseizures may occur after a severe head injury, especially apenetrating brain injury, a severe skull fracture, or a seri-ous brain hemorrhage. Recovery from a severe head injurycan be very slow, and it may take five years or longer toheal completely. Risk factors associated with an increasedlikelihood of memory problems or seizures after headinjury include age, length and depth of coma, duration ofpost-traumatic and retrograde amnesia, presence of focalbrain injuries, and initial Glasgow Coma Scale score.\nPrevention\nMany severe head injuries could be prevented by\nwearing protective helmets during certain sports, orwhen riding a bike or motorcycle. Seat belts and airbagscan prevent many head injuries as a result of car acci-dents. Appropriate protective headgear should always beworn on the job where head injuries are a possibility.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGreenberg, David A., et al. Clinical Neurology. 2nd ed.

    "title": "Headache",
    "content": "Headache\nDefinition\nA headache involves pain in the head which can arise\nfrom many disorders or may be a disorder in and of itself.\nDescription\nThere are three types of primary headaches: tension-\ntype (muscular contraction headache), migraine (vascu-lar headaches), and cluster. Virtually everyone experi-ences a tension-type headache at some point. An estimat-ed 18% of American women suffer migraines, comparedto 6% of men. Cluster headaches affect fewer than 0.5%of the population, and men account for approximately80% of all cases. Headaches caused by illness are sec-ondary headaches and are not included in these numbers.\nApproximately 40–45 million people in the United\nStates suffer chronic headaches. Headaches have anenormous impact on society due to missed workdays andproductivity losses.\nCauses and symptoms\nTraditional theories about headaches link tension-\ntype headaches to muscle contraction, and migraine andcluster headaches to blood vessel dilation (swelling).Pain-sensitive structures in the head include blood vesselwalls, membranous coverings of the brain, and scalp andneck muscles. Brain tissue itself has no sensitivity topain. Therefore, headaches may result from contractionof the muscles of the scalp, face or neck; dilation of theblood vessels in the head; or brain swelling that stretchesthe brain’s coverings. Involvement of specific nerves ofthe face and head may also cause characteristicheadaches. Sinus inflammation is a common cause ofheadache. Keeping a headache diary may help linkheadaches to stressful occurrences, menstrual phases,food triggers, or medication.\nTension-type headaches are often brought on by\nstress , overexertion, loud noise, and other external fac-\ntors. The typical tension-type headache is described as atightening around the head and neck, and an accompany-ing dull ache.\nMigraines are intense throbbing headaches occur-\nring on one or both sides of the head. The pain is accom-panied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,blurred vision, and aversion to light, sound, and move-ment. Migraines are often triggered by food items, suchas red wine, chocolate, and aged cheeses. For women, ahormonal connection is likely, since headaches occur atspecific points in the menstrual cycle, with use of oral\ncontraceptives , or the use of hormone replacement\ntherapy after menopause .\nCluster headaches cause excruciating pain. The\nsevere, stabbing pain centers around one eye, and eyetearing and nasal congestion occur on the same side. Theheadache lasts from 15 minutes to four hours and mayrecur several times in a day. Heavy smokers are morelikely to suffer cluster headaches, which are also associ-ated with alcohol consumption.\nDiagnosis\nSince headaches arise from many causes, a physical\nexam assesses general health and a neurologic exam\nevaluates the possibility of neurologic disease that iscausing the headache. If the headache is the primary ill-ness, a doctor elicits a thorough history of the headache.Questions revolve around its frequency and duration,when it occurs, pain intensity and location, possible trig-gers, and any prior symptoms. This information aids inclassifying the headache.\nWarning signs that should point out the need for\nprompt medical intervention include:\n• ”Worst headache of my life.” This may indicate sub-\narachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1523Headache(swollen blood vessel) in the head or other neurological\nemergency.\n• Headache accompanied by one-sided weakness, numb-\nness, visual loss, speech difficulty, or other signs. Thismay indicate a stroke . Migraines may include neuro-\nlogical symptoms.\n• Headache that becomes worse over a period of 6\nmonths, especially if most prominent in the morning orif accompanied by neurological symptoms. This mayindicate a brain tumor .\n• Sudden onset of headache. If accompanied by fever\nand stiff neck, this can indicate meningitis .\nHeadache diagnosis may include neurological imag-\ning tests such as computed tomography scan (CT scan)or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nTreatment\nHeadache treatment is divided into two forms:\nabortive and prophylactic. Abortive treatment addresses aheadache in progress, and prophylactic treatment pre-vents headache occurrence.\nTension-type and migraine headaches can be treated\nwith aspirin ,acetaminophen , ibuprofen, or naproxen. In\nearly 1998, the FDA approved extra-strength Excedrin,which includes caffeine , for mild to moderate migraines.\nPrescription medications such as antidepressants andmuscle relaxants can address tension-type headaches,\nand ergotamine tartrate or sumatriptan can relieve or pre-vent migraines. Cluster headaches may also be treatedKEY TERMS\nAbortive —Referring to treatment which relieves\nsymptoms of a disorder.\nAnalgesics —A class of pain-relieving medicines,\nincluding aspirin and Tylenol.\nBiofeedback —A technique in which a person is\ntaught to consciously control the body’s responseto a stimulus.\nChronic —Referring to a condition that occurs fre-\nquently or continuously or on a regular basis.\nProphylactic —Referring to treatment which pre-\nvents symptoms of a disorder from appearing.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation —A\nmethod that electrically stimulates nerve and blocksthe transmission of pain signals, called TENS.with ergotamine and sumatriptan, as well as by inhaling\npure oxygen. Prophylactic treatments include prednisone,calcium channel blockers , and methysergide.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative headache treatments include:\n• acupuncture or acupressure\n• biofeedback• chiropractic\n• herbal remedies using feverfew ( Chrysanthemum\nparthenium ), valerian ( Valeriana officinalis ), white wil-\nlow ( Salix alba ), or skullcap ( Scutellaria lateriflora ),\namong others\n• homeopathic remedies chosen specifically for the indi-\nvidual and his/her type of headache\n• hydrotherapy\n• massage• magnesium supplements\n• regular physical exercise\n• relaxation techniques, such as meditation and yoga\n• transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).\n(A test that electrically stimulates nerves and blocks thesignals of pain transmission)\nPrognosis\nHeadaches are typically resolved through the use of\nanalgesics and other treatments.\nPrevention\nSome headaches may be prevented by avoiding trig-\ngering substances and situations, or by employing alter-native therapies, such as yoga and regular exercise. Sincefood allergies are often linked with headaches, especial-\nly cluster headaches and migraines, identification andelimination of the allergy-causing food(s) from the dietcan be an important preventive measure.\nResources\nBOOKS\nRapoport, Alan M., and Fred D.

    "title": "Hearing aids",
    "content": "Hearing aids\nDefinition\nA hearing aid is a device that can amplify sound\nwaves in order to help a deaf or hard-of-hearing personhear sounds more clearly.\nPurpose\nRecent technology can help most people with hear-\ning loss understand speech better and achieve better\ncommunication.\nPrecautions\nIt’s important that a person being fitted for a hearing\naid understand what an aid can and can’t do. An aid canhelp a person hear better, but it won’t return hearing tonormal levels. Hearing aids boost all sounds, not justthose the person wishes to hear. Especially when thesource of sound is far away (such as up on a stage), envi-ronmental noise can interfere with good speech percep-tion. And while the aid amplifies sound, it doesn’t neces-sarily improve the clarity of the sound. A hearing aid is amachine, and can never duplicate the true sound that peo-ple with normal hearing experience, but it will help theperson take advantage of the hearing that remains.\nDescription\nMore than 1,000 different models are available in\nthe United States. All of them include a microphone (topick up sound), amplifier (to boost sound strength), areceiver or speaker (to deliver sound to the ear), and arepowered by a battery. Depending on the style, it’s possi-ble to add features to filter or block out backgroundnoise, minimize feedback, lower sound in noisy settings,or boost power when needed.\nHearing aids are either “monaural” (a hearing aid for\none ear), or “binaural” (for two ears); more than 65% ofall users have binaural aids. Hearing aids are divided intoseveral different types:\n• digital• in-the-ear• in-the-canal• behind-the-ear\n• on-the-body\nDigital aids are sophisticated, very expensive aids\nthat borrow computer technology to allow a person totailor an aid to a specific hearing loss pattern. Usingminiature computer chips, the aids can selectively boostcertain frequencies while leaving others alone. Thismeans a person could wear such an aid to a loud party,and screen out unwanted background noise, while tuningin on one-on-one conversations. The aid is programmedby the dealer to conform to the patient’s specific hearingloss. Some models can be programmed to allow thewearer to choose different settings depending on thenoise of the environment.\nIn-the-ear aids are lightweight devices whose cus-\ntom-made housings contain all the components; thisdevice fits into the ear canal with no visible wires ortubes. It’s possible to control tone but not volume withthese aids, so they are helpful only for people with mildhearing loss. Some people find these aids are easier toput on and take off than behind-the-ear aids. However,because they are custom-fit to a person’s ear, it is notpossible to try on before ordering. Some people findthem uncomfortable in hot weather.\nIn-the-canal aids fit far into the ear canal, with only a\nsmall bit extending into the external ear. The smallest isthe MicroCanal, which fits out of sight down next to theeardrum and is removed with a small transparent wire.These are extremely expensive, but they are not visible,offer better acoustics, and are easier to maintain. They canmore closely mimic natural sound because of the positionof the microphone; this position also cuts down on windnoise. But their small size makes them harder to handle,and their battery is especially small and difficult to insert.Adjusting the volume may be hard, since a person muststick a finger down into the ear to adjust volume, and thisvery tiny aid doesn’t have the power of other, larger, aids.\nBehind-the-ear aids include a microphone, amplifier\nand receiver inside a small curved case worn behind theear; the case is connected to the earmold by a short plas-tic tube. The earmold extends into the ear canal. Somemodels have both tone and volume control, plus a tele-phone pickup device. However, many users, think themunattractive and out of date; and people who wear glass-es find that the glasses interfere with the aid’s fit. Othersdon’t have space behind the ear for the mold to fit com-fortably. However, they do offer a few advantages.\nBehind-the-ear aids:\n• don’t require as much maintenance\n• are easily interchangeable if they need to be serviced\n• are more powerful\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1525Hearing aids• are easier to handle than smaller aids\n• can provide better sound quality\n• tend to be more reliable\nEyeglass models are the same as behind-the-ear\ndevices, except that the case fits into an eyeglass frameinstead of resting behind the ears. Not many peoplebuy this type of aid, but those who do believe it’s lessobvious, although there is a tube that travels from thetemple of the glasses to the earmold. But it can be hardto fit this type of aid, and repairs can be problematic.Also, if the aid breaks, the person also loses the benefitof the glasses.\nCROS or the crossover system type of hearing aid is\noften used in conjunction with the eyeglass model. TheCROS (contralateral routing of signal) system features amicrophone behind the ear that feeds the amplified signalto the better ear, eliminating “head shadow,” whichoccurs when the head blocks sound from the better ear.This type may help make speech easier to understand forpeople with a high-frequency loss in both ears.\nA BI-CROS system uses two microphones (one\nabove each ear) that send signals to a single amplifier.Sound then travels to a single receiver, which transfers itto the better ear via a conventional earmold.\nOn-the-body aids feature a larger microphone,\namplifier, and power supply inside a case carried insidethe pocket, or attached to clothing. The receiver attaches\ndirectly to the earmold; its power comes through a flexi-ble wire from the amplifier. Although larger than otheraids, the on-the-body aids are more powerful and easierto adjust than other devices. While not popular for every-one, they are often used by those with a profound hearingloss, or by very young children. Some people who arealmost totally deaf find they need the extra power boostavailable only from a body aid.\nThe latest aids on the market may eliminate the\namplifier and speaker in favor of a tiny magnet mountedon a silicone disk, similar to a contact lens, which restsright on the eardrum. Called the Earlens, it is designed tobe held in place by a thin film of oil. Users wear a wire-less microphone, either in the ear or on a necklace, thatpicks up sounds and converts them into magnetic signals,making the magnet vibrate. As the Earlens vibrates, sodoes the eardrum, transmitting normal-sounding tones tothe middle and inner ears.\nOther researchers are bypassing the middle ear\ncompletely; they surgically implant a tiny magnet inthe inner ear. By attaching a magnet to the round win-dow, they open a second pathway to the inner ear. Anelectromagnetic coil implanted in bone behind the earvibrates the implanted magnet. Unlike the Earlens,this magnetic implant would not block the normalhearing pathway.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1526Hearing aids\nIN-THE-EAR HEARING AIDEar mold\nConnecting tube\nEar hook\nOn/off switch\nMicrophone\nMicrophoneSound tubeOn/off switch and \nvolume control\nVolume control\nBattery compartmentBattery \ncompartment\nBEHIND-THE-EAR HEARING AID\nHearing aids are devices that can amplify sound waves to help a deaf or hard-of-hearing person hear sounds more clearly.\n(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Preparation\nThe fist step in getting a hearing aid is to have a\nmedical exam and a hearing evaluation. (Most states pro-hibit anyone selling a hearing aid until the patient hasbeen examined by a physician to rule out medical prob-lems.) After performing a hearing evaluation, an audiolo-gist should be able to determine whether a hearing aidwill help, and which one will do the most good. This isespecially important because aids can be very expensive(between $500 and $4,000), and are often not covered byhealth insurance. Hearing aids come in a wide range ofstyles and types, requiring careful testing to make surethe aid is the best choice for a particular hearing loss.\nSome audiologists sell aids; others can make a rec-\nommendation, or give one a list of competent dealers inone’s area. Patients should shop around and compareprices. In all but three states, hearing aids must be fittedand sold only by licensed specialists called dealers, spe-cialists, dispensers, or dispensing audiologists.\nThe hearing aid dealer will make an impression of\nthe consumer’s ears using a putty-like material, fromwhich a personalized earmold will be created. It’s thedealer’s job to make sure the aid fits properly. The personmay need several visits to find the right hearing aid andlearn how to use it. The dealer will help the consumerlearn how to put the aid on, adjust the controls, and main-tain the device. The dealer should be willing to servicethe aid and provide information about what to do if sensi-tivity to the earmold develops. (Some people are allergicto the materials in the mold.)\nAftercare\nWithin several weeks, the wearer should return to\nthe dealer to have the aid checked, and to discuss theprogress in wearing the aid. About 40% of all aids needsome modification or adjustment in the beginning.\nWithin the first month of getting an aid, the patient\nshould make an appointment for a full hearing examina-tion to determine if the aid is functioning properly.\nRisks\nWhile there are no medical risks to hearing aids,\nthere is a risk associated with hearing aids: many peopleend up not wearing their aids because they say every-thing seems loud when wearing them. This is becausethey have lived for so long with a hearing problem thatthey have forgotten how loud “normal” sound can be.Other potential problems with hearing aids include ear-mold discomfort, and a build up of excess ear wax aftergetting a hearing aid.KEY TERMS\nAudiologist —A person with a degree and/or certi-\nfication in the areas of identification and measure-ment of hearing impairments and rehabilitation ofthose with hearing problems.\nEardrum —A paper-thin covering stretching across\nthe ear canal that separates the middle and outerears.\nMiddle ear —The small cavity between the eardrum\nand the oval window that houses the three tinybones of hearing.\nOval window —A tiny opening at the entrance to\nthe inner ear.\nNormal results\nA hearing aid will boost the loudness of sound, which\ncan improve a person’s ability to understand speech.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarmen, Richard.

Turkington\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1527Hearing aidsHearing loss\nDefinition\nHearing loss is any degree of impairment of the abil-\nity to apprehend sound.\nDescription\nSound can be measured accurately. The term decibel\n(dB) refers to an amount of energy moving sound from itssource to our ears or to a microphone. A drop of more than10 dB in the level of sound a person can hear is significant.\nSound travels through a medium like air or water as\nwaves of compression and rarefaction. These waves arecollected by the external ear and cause the tympanic mem-brane (ear drum) to vibrate. The chain of ossicles connect-ed to the ear drum—the incus, malleus, and stapes—car-ries the vibration to the oval window, increasing its ampli-tude 20 times on the way. There the energy causes a stand-ing wave in the watery liquid (endolymph) inside theOrgan of Corti. (A standing wave is one that does notmove. A vibrating cup of coffee will demonstrate standingwaves.) The configuration of the standing wave is deter-mined by the frequency of the sound. Many thousands oftiny nerve fibers detect the highs and lows of the standingwave and transmit their findings to the brain, which inter-prets the signals as sound.\nTo summarize, sound energy passes through the air\nof the external ear, the bones of the middle ear and theliquid of the inner ear. It is then translated into nerveimpulses, sent to the brain through nerves and under-stood there as sound. It follows that there are five steps inthe hearing process:\n• air conduction through the external ear to the ear drum• bone conduction through the middle ear to the inner ear• water conduction to the Organ of Corti• nerve conduction into the brain\n• interpretation by the brain\nHearing can be interrupted in several ways at each of\nthe five steps.\nThe external ear canal can be blocked with ear wax,\nforeign objects , infection, and tumors. Overgrowth of\nthe bone, a condition that occurs when the ear canal hasbeen flushed with cold water repeatedly for years, canalso narrow the passageway, making blockage and infec-tion more likely. This condition occurs often in NorthernCalifornian surfers and is therefore called “surfer’s ear.”\nThe ear drum is so thin a physician can see through\nit into the middle ear. Sharp objects, pressure from aninfection in the middle ear, even a firm cuffing or slap-ping of the ear, can rupture it. It is also susceptible topressure changes during scuba diving.\nSeveral conditions can diminish the mobility of the\nossicles (small bones) in the middle ear. Otitis media (an\ninfection in the middle ear) occurs when fluid cannotescape into the throat because of blockage of theeustachian tube. The fluid that accumulates, whether itbe pus or just mucus and dampens the motion of the ossi-cles. A disease called otosclerosis can bind the stapes in\nthe oval window and thereby cause deafness.\nAll the conditions mentioned so far, those that occur\nin the external and middle ear, are causes of conductivehearing loss. The second category, sensory hearing loss,refers to damage to the Organ of Corti and the acousticnerve. Prolonged exposure to loud noise is the leadingcause of sensory hearing loss. A million people have thiscondition, many identified during the military draft andrejected as being unfit for duty. The cause is oftenbelieved to be prolonged exposure to rock music. Occu-pational noise exposure is the other leading cause ofnoise induced hearing loss (NIHL) and is ample reasonfor wearing ear protection on the job. A third of peopleover 65 have presbycusis—sensory hearing loss due toaging . Both NIHL and presbycusis are primarily high\nfrequency losses. In most languages, it is the high fre-quency sounds that define speech, so these people hearplenty of noise, they just cannot easily make out what itmeans. They have particular trouble selecting out speechfrom background noise. Brain infections like meningi-\ntis, drugs such as the aminoglycoside antibiotics (strep-\ntomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, tobramycin), andMeniere’s disease also cause permanent sensory hear-\ning loss. Meniere’s disease combines attacks of hearingloss with attacks of vertigo. The symptoms may occurtogether or separately. High doses of salicylates likeaspirin and quinine can cause a temporary high-fre-\nquency loss. Prolonged high doses can lead to perma-nent deafness. There is an hereditary form of sensorydeafness and a congenital form most often caused byrubella (German measles ).\nSudden hearing loss—at least 30dB in less than\nthree days—is most commonly caused by cochleitis, amysterious viral infection.\nThe final category of hearing loss is neural. Damage\nto the acoustic nerve and the parts of the brain that per-form hearing are the most likely to produce permanenthearing loss. Strokes, multiple sclerosis , and acoustic\nneuromas are all possible causes of neural hearing loss.\nHearing can also be diminished by extra sounds gen-\nerated by the ear, most of them from the same kinds ofdisorders that cause diminished hearing. These sounds are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1528Hearing lossreferred to as tinnitus and can be ringing, blowing, click-\ning, or anything else that no one but the patient hears.\nDiagnosis\nAn examination of the ears and nose combined with\nsimple hearing tests done in the physician’s office candetect many common causes of hearing loss. An audio-gram often concludes the evaluation, since these simplemeans often produce a diagnosis. If the defect is in thebrain or the acoustic nerve, further neurological testingand imaging will be required.\nThe audiogram has many uses in diagnosing hearing\ndeficits. The pattern of hearing loss across the audible fre-quencies gives clues to the cause. Several alterations in thetesting procedure can give additional information. Forexample, speech is perceived differently than pure tones.Adequate perception of sound combined with inability torecognize words points to a brain problem rather than asensory or conductive deficit. Loudness perception is dis-torted by disease in certain areas but not in others. Acousticneuromas often distort the perception of loudness.Treatment\nConductive hearing loss can almost always be\nrestored to some degree, if not completely.\n• matter in the ear canal can be easily removed with a\ndramatic improvement in hearing.\n• surfer’s ear gradually regresses if cold water is avoided\nor a special ear plug is used. In advanced cases, sur-geons can grind away the excess bone.\n• middle ear infection with fluid is also simple to treat. If\nmedications do not work, surgical drainage of the ear isaccomplished through the ear drum, which heals com-pletely after treatment.\n• traumatically damaged ear drums can be repaired with\na tiny skin graft.\n• surgical repair of otosclerosis through an operating\nmicroscope is one of the most intricate of procedures,substituting tiny artificial parts for the original ossicles.\nSensory and neural hearing loss, on the other hand,\ncannot readily be cured. Fortunately it is not often com-plete, so that hearing aids can fill the deficit.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1529Hearing loss\nAn Oto-Acoustic Emission (OAE) hearing test being perfomred on a newborn baby.The probe emits harmless sound into the\nbaby’s ear, and the response of the inner ear is detected and registered on a computer. Early diagnosis of a hearing disorderis important in young children, who may experience difficulties in speech and language development. (Photograph by James\nKing-Holmes, Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)In-the-ear hearing aids can boost the volume of\nsound by up to 70 dB. (Normal speech is about 60 dB.)Federal law now requires that they be dispensed onlyupon a physician’s prescription. For complete conductionhearing loss there are now available bone conductionhearing aids and even devices that can be surgicallyimplanted in the cochlea.\nTinnitus can sometimes be relieved by adding white\nnoise (like the sound of wind or waves crashing on theshore) to the environment.\nDecreased hearing is such a common problem that\nthere are legions of organizations to provide assistance.Special language training, both in lip reading and sign-ing, special schools and special camps for children are allavailable in most regions of the United States.\nAlternative treatment\nConductive hearing loss can be treated with alterna-\ntive therapies that are specific to the particular condition.Sensory hearing loss may be helped by homeopathictherapies. Oral supplementation with essential fatty acidssuch as flax oil and omega 3 oil can help alleviate theaccumulation of wax in the ear.\nPrevention\nPrompt treatment and attentive follow-up of middle\near infections in children will prevent this cause of con-ductive hearing loss.

The vibrationsproduced can be used to assess a person’s ability to hearvarious sound frequencies.\nPurpose\nA vibrating tuning fork held next to the ear or placed\nagainst the skull will stimulate the inner ear to vibrate,and can help determine if there is hearing loss .\nPrecautions\nNo special precautions are necessary when tuning\nforks are used to conduct a hearing test.\nDescription\nTwo types of hearing tests with tuning forks are typi-\ncally conducted. In the Rinne test, the vibrating tuningfork is held against the skull, usually on the bone behindthe ear (mastoid process) to cause vibrations through thebones of the skull and inner ear. It is also held next to, butnot touching, the ear, to cause vibrations in the air next tothe ear. The patient is asked to determine which sound islouder, the sound heard through the bone or through theair. A second hearing test using a tuning fork is theWeber test. For this test, the stem or handle of the vibrat-ing tuning fork is placed at various points along the mid-line of the skull and face. The patient is then asked toidentify which ear hears the sound created by the vibra-tions. Tuning forks of different sizes produce differentfrequencies of vibrations and can be used to establish therange of hearing for an individual patient.\nPreparation\nNo special preparation is required for a hearing test\nwith tuning forks.\nAftercare\nNo special aftercare is required. If hearing loss is\nrevealed during testing with tuning forks, the patient mayKEY TERMS\nMastoid process —The protrusions of bone behind\nthe ears at the base of the skull.\nRinne test —A hearing test using a vibrating tuning\nfork which is held near the ear and held at theback of the skull.\nWeber test —A hearing test using a vibrating tun-\ning fork which is held at various points along themidline of the skull and face.\nrequire further testing to determine the extent of the hear-\ning loss.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with the use of tuning\nforks to screen for hearing loss.\nNormal results\nWith the Rinne test, a person will hear the tone of\nthe vibration longer and louder when the tuning fork isheld next to the ear, rather than when it is held against themastoid bone. For the Weber test, the tone producedwhen the tuning fork is placed along the center of theskull, or face, sounds about the same volume in each ear.\nAbnormal results\nThe Rinne test detects a hearing loss when a patient\nhears a louder and longer tone when the vibrating tuningfork is held against the mastoid bone than when it is heldnext to the ear. The volume of sound vibrations conduct-ed through parts of the skull and face in the Weber testcan indicate which ear may have a hearing loss.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Clinical Evaluation of Complaints Referable to the Ears.” In\nThe Merck Manual. 16th ed.

    "title": "Heart attack",
    "content": "Heart attack\nDefinition\nA heart attack is the death of, or damage to, part of\nthe heart muscle because the supply of blood to the heartmuscle is severely reduced or stopped.\nDescription\nHeart attack is the leading cause of death in the\nUnited States. More than 1.5 million Americans suffer aheart attack every year, and almost half a million die,according to the American Heart Association. Most heartattacks are the end result of years of silent but progres-sive coronary artery disease , which can be prevented in\nmany people. A heart attack is often the first symptom ofcoronary artery disease. According to the AmericanHeart Association, 63% of women and 48% of men whodied suddenly of coronary artery disease had no previoussymptoms. Heart attacks are also called myocardialinfarctions (MIs).\nA heart attack occurs when one or more of the coro-\nnary arteries that supply blood to the heart are complete-ly blocked and blood to the heart muscle is cut off. Theblockage is usually caused by atherosclerosis , the build-\nup of plaque in the artery walls, and/or by a blood clot ina coronary artery. Sometimes, a healthy or atherosclerot-ic coronary artery has a spasm and the blood flow to partof the heart decreases or stops. Why this happens isunclear, but it can result in a heart attack.\nAbout half of all heart attack victims wait at least\ntwo hours before seeking help. This increases theirchance of sudden death or being disabled. The longerthe artery remains blocked during a heart attack, themore damage will be done to the heart. If the bloodsupply is cut off severely or for a long time, musclecells suffer irreversible injury and die. The patientcan die. That is why it is important to recognize thesigns of a heart attack and seek prompt medical atten-tion at the nearest hospital with 24-hour emergencycardiac care.About one fifth of all heart attacks are silent, that is,\nthe victim does not know one has occurred. Although thevictim feels no pain , silent heart attacks can still damage\nthe heart.\nThe outcome of a heart attack also depends on\nwhere the blockage is, whether the heart rhythm is dis-turbed, and whether another coronary artery suppliesblood to that part of the heart. Blockages in the left coro-nary artery are usually more serious than in the rightcoronary artery. Blockages that cause an arrhythmia, anirregular heartbeat, can cause sudden death.\nCauses and symptoms\nHeart attacks are generally caused by severe coro-\nnary artery disease. Most heart attacks are caused byblood clots that form on atherosclerotic plaque. Thisblocks a coronary artery from supplying oxygen-richblood to part of the heart. A number of major and con-tributing risk factors increase the risk of developing coro-nary artery disease. Some of these can be changed andsome cannot. People with more risk factors are morelikely to develop coronary artery disease.\nMajor risk factors\nMajor risk factors significantly increase the risk of\ncoronary artery disease. Those which cannot be changedare:\n• Heredity. People whose parents have coronary artery\ndisease are more likely to develop it. African Ameri-cans are also at increased risk, due to their higher rateof severe hypertension than whites.\n• Sex. Men under the age of 60 years of age are more like-\nly to have heart attacks than women of the same age.\n• Age. Men over the age of 45 and women over the age\nof 55 are considered at risk. Older people (those over65) are more likely to die of a heart attack. Olderwomen are twice as likely to die within a few weeks ofa heart attack as a man. This may be because of theirother co-existing medical problems.\nMajor risk factors which can be changed are:\n•Smoking . Smoking greatly increases both the chance\nof developing coronary artery disease and the change ofdying from it. Smokers have two to four times the riskof non-smokers of sudden cardiac death and are more\nthan twice as likely to have a heart attack. They are alsomore likely to die within an hour of a heart attack. Sec-ond-hand smoke may also increase risk.\n•High cholesterol . Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance\nthat is produced by the body, as well as obtained fromeating foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal prod-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1532Heart attackucts. Cholesterol level is affected by age, sex, heredity,\nand diet. Risk of developing coronary artery diseaseincreases as blood cholesterol levels increase. Whencombined with other factors, the risk is even greater.Total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL and over poses a highrisk, and 200–239 mg/dL a borderline high risk. InLDL cholesterol, high risk starts at 130–159 mg/dL,depending on other risk factors. HDL (healthy choles-terol) can lower or raise the coronary risk also.\n• High blood pressure. High blood pressure makes the\nheart work harder, and over time, weakens it. It increas-es the risk of heart attack, stroke , kidney failure, and\ncongestive heart failure . A blood pressure of 140 over\n90 or above is considered high. As the numbersincrease, high blood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild)to Stage 4 (very severe). When combined with obesity ,\nsmoking, high cholesterol, or diabetes, the risk of heartattack or stroke increases several times.\n• Lack of physical activity. This increases the risk of\ncoronary artery disease. Even modest physical activityis beneficial if done regularly.\nContributing risk factors\nContributing risk factors have been linked to coro-\nnary artery disease, but their significance and prevalenceare not known yet. Contributing risk factors are:\n• Diabetes mellitus. The risk of developing coronary\nartery disease is seriously increased for diabetics. Morethan 80% of diabetics die of some type of heart orblood vessel disease.\n• Obesity. Excess weight increases the strain on the heart\nand increases the risk of developing coronary arterydisease, even if no other risk factors are present. Obesi-ty increases both blood pressure and blood cholesterol,and can lead to diabetes.\n•Stress and anger. Some scientists believe that stress and\nanger can contribute to the development of coronaryartery disease. Stress, the mental and physical reactionto life’s irritations and challenges, increases the heartrate and blood pressure, and can injure the lining of thearteries. Evidence shows that anger increases the risk ofdying from heart disease and more than doubles the riskof having a heart attack right after an episode of anger.\nMore than 60% of heart attack victims experience\nsymptoms before the heart attack occurs. These sometimesoccur days or weeks before the heart attack. Sometimes,people do not recognize the symptoms of a heart attack orare in denial that they are having one. Symptoms are:\n• Uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing, or pain in\nthe center of the chest. This lasts more than a few min-utes, or may go away and return.• Pain that spreads to the shoulders, neck, or arms.\n• Chest discomfort accompanied by lightheadedness,\nfainting , sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath .\nAll of these symptoms do not occur with every heart\nattack. Sometimes, symptoms disappear and then reap-pear. A person with any of these symptoms should imme-diately call an emergency rescue service or be driven tothe nearest hospital with a 24-hour cardiac care unit,whichever is quicker.\nDiagnosis\nExperienced emergency care personnel can usually\ndiagnose a heart attack simply by looking at the patient.To confirm this diagnosis, they talk with the patient,check heart rate and blood pressure, perform an electro-cardiogram, and take a blood sample. The electrocardio-gram shows which coronary artery is blocked. Electrodescovered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient’schest, arms, and legs. They send impulses of the heart’sactivity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) to arecorder, which traces them on paper. The blood testshows the leak of enzymes or other biochemical markersfrom damaged cells in the heart muscle.\nTreatment\nHeart attacks are treated with cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR ) when necessary to start and keep the\npatient breathing and his heart beating. Additional treat-ment can include close monitoring, electric shock, drugtherapy, re-vascularization procedures, percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery\nbypass surgery. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient isclosely monitored. An electrical-shock device, a defibril-lator, may be used to restore a normal rhythm if the heart-beat is fluttering uncontrollably. Oxygen is often used toease the heart’s workload or to help victims of severeheart attack breath easier. If oxygen is used within hoursof the heart attack, it may help limit damage to the heart.\nDrugs to stabilize the patient and limit damage to the\nheart include thrombolytics, aspirin , anticoagulants,\npainkillers and tranquilizers, beta-blockers, ace-inhibitors, nitrates, rhythm-stabilizing drugs, and diuret-\nics. Drugs that limit damage to the heart work only if\ngiven within a few hours of the heart attack. Thrombolyt-ic drugs that break up blood clots and enable oxygen-richblood to flow through the blocked artery increase thepatient’s chance of survival if given as soon as possibleafter the heart attack. Thrombolytics given within a fewhours after a heart attack are the most effective. Injectedintravenously, these include anisoylated plasminogenstreptokinase activator complex (APSAC) or anistreplase\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1533Heart attack(Eminase), recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activa-\ntor (r-tPA, Retevase, or Activase), and streptokinase(Streptase, Kabikinase).\nTo prevent additional heart attacks, aspirin and an\nanticoagulant drug often follow the thrombolytic drug.These prevent new blood clots from forming and existingblood clots from growing. Anticoagulant drugs help pre-vent the blood from clotting. The most common antico-agulants are heparin and warfarin. Heparin is given intra-venously while the patient is in the hospital; warfarin,taken orally, is often given later. Aspirin helps to preventthe dissolved blood clots from reforming.\nTo relieve pain, a nitroglycerine tablet taken under\nthe tongue may be given. If the pain continues, morphinesulfate may be prescribed. Tranquilizers such asdiazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Ativan) may be pre-scribed to lessen the trauma of a heart attack.\nTo slow down the heart rate and give the heart a\nchance to heal, beta-blockers are often given intra-venously right after the heart attack. These can also helpprevent the sometimes fatal ventricular fibrillation .\nBeta-blockers include atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol(Lopressor), nadolol, pindolol (Visken), propranolol(Inderal), and timolol (Blocadren).\nNitrates, a type of vasodilator, are also given right\nafter a heart attack to help improve the delivery of bloodto the heart and ease heart failure symptoms. Nitratesinclude isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), isosorbide dini-trate (Isordil, Sorbitrate), and nitroglycerin (Nitrostat).\nWhen a heart attack causes an abnormal heartbeat,\narrhythmia drugs may be given to restore the heart’s nor-mal rhythm. These include: amiodarone (Cordarone),atropine, bretylium, disopyramide (Norpace), lidocaine(Xylocaine), procainamide (Procan), propafenone (Ryth-mol), propranolol (Inderal), quinidine, and sotalol (Beta-pace). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitorsreduce the resistance against which the heart beats andare used to manage and prevent heart failure. They areused to treat heart attack patients whose hearts do notpump well or who have symptoms of heart failure. Takenorally, they include Altace, Capoten, Lotensin, Monopril,Prinivil, Vasotec, and Zestril. Angiotensin receptorblockers, such as losartan (Cozaar) may substitute.Diuretics can help get rid of excess fluids that sometimesaccumulate when the heart is not pumping effectively.Usually taken orally, they cause the body to dispose offluids through urination. Common diuretics include:bumetanide (Bumex), chlorthalidone (Hygroton),chlorothiazide (Diuril), furosemide (Lasix),hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIRUIL, Esidrix), spirono-lactone (Aldactone), and triamterene (Dyrenium).Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\ncoronary artery bypass surgery are invasive revascular-ization procedures which open blocked coronary arteriesand improve blood flow. They are usually performedonly on patients for whom clot-dissolving drugs do notwork, or who have poor exercise stress tests, poor left\nventricular function, or ischemia . Generally, angioplasty\nis performed before coronary artery bypass surgery.\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,\nusually called coronary angioplasty, is a non-surgicalprocedure in which a catheter (a tiny plastic tube) tippedwith a balloon is threaded from a blood vessel in thethigh or arm into the blocked artery. The balloon is inflat-ed and compresses the plaque to enlarge the blood vesseland open the blocked artery. The balloon is then deflatedand the catheter is removed. Coronary angioplasty is per-formed by a cardiologist in a hospital and generallyrequires a two-day stay. It is successful about 90% of thetime. For one third of patients, the artery narrows againwithin six months after the procedure. The procedure canbe repeated. It is less invasive and less expensive thancoronary artery bypass surgery.\nIn coronary artery bypass surgery, called bypass\nsurgery, a detour is built around the coronary arteryblockage with a healthy leg or chest wall artery or vein.The healthy vein then supplies oxygen-rich blood to theheart. Bypass surgery is major surgery appropriate forpatients with blockages in two or three major coronaryarteries or severely narrowed left main coronary arteries,as well as those who have not responded to other treat-ments. It is performed in a hospital under general anes-thesia using a heart-lung machine to support the patientwhile the healthy vein is attached to the coronary artery.About 70% of patients who have bypass surgery experi-ence full relief from angina ; about 20% experience par-\ntial relief. Long term, symptoms recur in only about threeor four percent of patients per year. Five years afterbypass surgery, survival expectancy is 90%, at 10 years itis about 80%, at 15 years it is about 55%, and at 20 yearsit is about 40%.\nThere are three experimental surgical procedures for\nunblocking coronary arteries which are currently beingstudied: atherectomy , where the surgeon shaves off and\nremoves strips of plaque from the blocked artery; laserangioplasty, where a catheter with a laser tip is insertedto burn or break down the plaque; and insertion of ametal coil called a stent that can be implanted perma-nently to keep a blocked artery open.\nPrognosis\nThe aftermath of a heart attack is often severe. Two-\nthirds of heart attack patients never recover fully. Within\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1534Heart attackone year, 27% of men and 44% of women die. Within six\nyears, 23% of men and 31% of women have anotherheart attack, 13% of men and 6% of women experiencesudden death, and about 20% have heart failure. Peoplewho survive a heart attack have a chance of sudden deaththat is four to six times greater than others and a chanceof illness and death that is two to nine times greater.Older women are more likely than men to die within afew weeks of a heart attack.\nPrevention\nMany heart attacks can be prevented through a\nhealthy lifestyle, which can reduce the risk of developingcoronary artery disease. For patients who have alreadyhad a heart attack, a healthy lifestyle and carefully fol-lowing doctor’s orders can prevent another heart attack.A heart healthy lifestyle includes eating right, regularexercise, maintaining a healthy weight, no smoking,moderate drinking, no illegal drugs, controlling hyper-tension, and managing stress.\nA healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are\nlow in fat (especially saturated fat), low in cholesterol,and high in fiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; andlimited sodium. Some foods are low in fat but high incholesterol, and some are low in cholesterol but high infat. Saturated fat raises cholesterol, and, in excessiveamounts, it increases the amount of the proteins in bloodthat form blood clots. Polyunsaturated and monounsatu-rated fats are relatively good for the heart. Fat shouldcomprise no more than 30 percent of total daily calories.\nCholesterol, a waxy, lipid-like substance, comes\nfrom eating foods such as meat, eggs, and other animalproducts. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble fibercan help lower cholesterol. Cholesterol should be limitedto about 300 mg per day. Many popular lipid-loweringdrugs can reduce LDL-cholesterol by an average of25–30% when combined with a low-fat, low-cholesteroldiet. Fruits and vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins , and\nminerals . They are also low calorie and nearly fat free.\nVitamin C and beta-carotene, found in many fruits andvegetables, keep LDL-cholesterol from turning into aform that damages coronary arteries. Excess sodium canincrease the risk of high blood pressure. Many processedfoods contain large amounts of sodium. Limit dailyintake to about 2,400 mg—about the amount in a tea-spoon of salt.\nThe “Food Guide” Pyramid developed by the U.S.\nDepartments of Agriculture and Health and Human Ser-vices provides easy to follow guidelines for daily heart-healthy eating: six to 11 servings of bread, cereal, rice,and pasta; three to five servings of vegetables; two tofour servings of fruit; two to three servings of milk,KEY TERMS\nAngina —Chest pain that happens when diseased\nblood vessels restrict the flow of blood to theheart. Angina is often the first symptom of coro-nary artery disease.\nAtherosclerosis —A process in which the walls of\nthe coronary arteries thicken due to the accumula-tion of plaque in the blood vessels. Atherosclerosisis the cause of coronary artery disease.\nCoronary arteries —The two arteries that provide\nblood to the heart. The coronary arteries surroundthe heart like a crown, coming out of the aorta,arching down over the top of the heart, and divid-ing into two branches. These are the arteries wherecoronary artery disease occurs.\nMyocardial infarction —The technical term for heart\nattack. Myocardial means heart muscle and infarc-tion means death of tissue from lack of oxygen.\nPlaque —A deposit of fatty and other substances\nthat accumulate in the lining of the artery wall.\nyogurt, and cheese; and 2–3 servings of meat, poultry,\nfish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. Fats, oils, and sweetsshould be used sparingly.\nRegular aerobic exercise can lower blood pressure,\nhelp control weight, and increase HDL (“good”) choles-terol. It may keep the blood vessels more flexible. Mod-erate intensity aerobic exercise lasting about 30 minutesfour or more times per week is recommended for maxi-mum heart health, according to the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention and the American College ofSports Medicine. Three 10-minute exercise periods arealso beneficial. Aerobic exercise—activities such aswalking, jogging, and cycling—uses the large musclegroups and forces the body to use oxygen more efficient-ly. It can also include everyday activities such as activegardening, climbing stairs, or brisk housework.\nMaintaining a desirable body weight is also impor-\ntant. About one quarter of all Americans are overweight,and nearly one-tenth are obese, according to the SurgeonGeneral’s Report on Nutrition and Health. People who\nare 20% or more over their ideal body weight have anincreased risk of developing coronary artery disease.Losing weight can help reduce total and LDL choles-terol, reduce triglycerides, and boost relative levels ofHDL cholesterol. It may also reduce blood pressure.\nSmoking has many adverse effects on the heart. It\nincreases the heart rate, constricts major arteries, and can\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1535Heart attackcreate irregular heartbeats. It also raises blood pressure,\ncontributes to the development of plaque, increases theformation of blood clots, and causes blood platelets tocluster and impede blood flow. Heart damage caused bysmoking can be repaired by quitting—even heavy smok-ers can return to heart health. Several studies have shownthat ex-smokers face the same risk of heart disease asnon-smokers within five to 10 years of quitting.\nDrinking should be done in moderation. Modest\nconsumption of alcohol can actually protect against coro-nary artery disease. This is believed to be because alco-hol raises HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels. The Ameri-can Heart Association defines moderate consumption asone ounce of alcohol per day—roughly one cocktail, one8-ounce glass of wine, or two 12-ounce glasses of beer.In some people, however, moderate drinking can increaserisk factors for heart disease, such as raising blood pres-sure. Excessive drinking is always bad for the heart. Itusually raises blood pressure, and can poison the heartand cause abnormal heart rhythms or even heart failure.Illegal drugs, like cocaine , can seriously harm the heart\nand should never be used.\nHigh blood pressure, one of the most common and\nserious risk factors for coronary artery disease, can becompletely controlled through lifestyle changes andmedication. People with moderate hypertension may beable to control it through lifestyle changes such as reduc-ing sodium and fat, exercising regularly, managingstress, quitting smoking, and drinking alcohol in modera-tion. If these changes do not work, and for people withsevere hypertension, there are eight types of drugs thatprovide effective treatment.\nStress management means controlling mental and\nphysical reactions to life’s irritations and challenges.Techniques for controlling stress include: taking lifemore slowly, spending time with family and friends,thinking positively, getting enough sleep, exercising, andpracticing relaxation techniques.\nDaily aspirin therapy has been proven to help pre-\nvent blood clots associated with atherosclerosis. It canalso prevent heart attacks from recurring, prevent heartattacks from being fatal, and lower the risk of strokes.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Heart Association.

    "title": "Heart block",
    "content": "Heart block\nDefinition\nHeart block refers to a delay in the normal flow of\nelectrical impulses that cause the heart to beat. They arefurther classified as first-, second-, or third-degree block.\nDescription\nThe muscles of the heart contract in a rhythmic\norder for each heart beat, because electrical impulsestravel along a specific route called the conduction sys-tem. The main junction of this system is called the atri-oventricular node (A V node). Just as on a highway, thereare occasionally some delays getting the impulse fromone point to another. These delays are classified accord-ing to their severity.\nIn first-degree heart block, the signal is just slowed\ndown a little as it travels along the defective part of theconduction system so that it arrives late traveling fromthe atrium to the ventricle.\nIn second-degree heart block, not every impulse\nreaches its destination. The block may affect every otherbeat, every second or third beat, or be very rare. If theblockage is frequent, it results in an overall slowing ofthe heart called bradycardia.\nThird-degree block, also called complete heart block,\nis the most serious. When no signals can travel throughthe A V node, the heart uses its backup impulse generator\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1536Heart blockin the lower portion of the heart. Though this impulse\nusually keeps the heart from stopping entirely, it is tooslow to be an effective pump.\nCauses and symptoms\nFirst-degree heart block is fairly common. It is seen\nin teenagers, young adults and in well-trained athletes.The condition may be caused by rheumatic fever , some\ntypes of heart disease and by some drugs. First-degreeheart block produces no symptoms.\nSome cases of second-degree heart block may bene-\nfit from an artificial pace-maker. Second-degree blockcan occasionally progress to third-degree.\nThird-degree heart block is a serious condition that\naffects the heart’s ability to pump blood effectively.Symptoms include fainting ,dizziness and sudden heart\nfailure . If the ventricles beat more than 40 times per\nminute, symptoms are not as severe, but include tiredness,low blood pressure on standing, and shortness of breath .\nYoung children who have received a forceful blunt\nchest injury, can experience first-, or second-degree heartblock.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of first-, and second-degree heart block is\nmade by observing it on an electrocardiograph (ECG).\nThird-degree heart block usually results in symp-\ntoms such as fainting, dizziness and sudden heart failure,which require immediate medical care. A physical examand ECG confirm the presence of heart block.\nTreatment\nSome second- and almost all third-degree heart\nblocks require an artificial pacemaker. In an emergency,a temporary pacemaker can be used until an implanteddevice is advisable. Most people need the pacemaker forthe rest of their lives.\nPrognosis\nMost people with first- and second-degree heart\nblock don’t even know they have it. For people withthird-degree block, once the heart has been restored to itsnormal, dependable rhythm, most people, live full andcomfortable lives.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMcGoon, Michael D., ed.

    "title": "Heart failure",
    "content": "Heart failure\nDefinition\nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart has\nlost the ability to pump enough blood to the body’s tis-sues. With too little blood being delivered, the organs andother tissues do not receive enough oxygen and nutrientsto function properly.\nDescription\nAccording to the American Heart Association, about\n4.9 million Americans are living with congestive heartfailure. Of these, 2.5 million are males and 2.4 millionare females. Ten people out of every 1,000 people overage 65 have this condition. There are about 400,000 newcases each year.\nHeart failure happens when a disease affects the\nheart’s ability to deliver enough blood to the body’s tissues.Often, a person with heart failure may have a buildup offluid in the tissues, called edema . Heart failure with this\nkind of fluid buildup is called congestive heart failure.Where edema occurs in the body depends on the part of theheart that is affected by heart failure. Heart failure causedby abnormality of the lower left chamber of the heart (leftventricle) means that the left ventricle cannot pump bloodout to the body as fast as it returns from the lungs. Becauseblood cannot get back to the heart, it begins to back up inthe blood vessels of the lungs. Some of the fluid in theblood is forced into the breathing space of the lungs, caus-ing pulmonary edema . A person with pulmonary edema\nhas shortness of breath , which may be acute and severe\nand life threatening. A person with congestive heart failurefeels tired because not enough blood circulates to supplythe body’s tissues with the oxygen and nutrients they need.Abnormalities of the heart structure and rhythm can also beresponsible for left ventricular congestive heart failure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1537Heart failureIn right-sided heart failure, the lower right chamber\nof the heart (right ventricle) cannot pump blood to thelungs as fast as it returns from the body through theveins. Blood then engorges the right side of the heart andthe veins. Fluid backed up in the veins is forced out intothe tissues, causing swelling (edema), usually in the feetand legs. Congestive heart failure of the right ventricle isoften caused by abnormalities of the heart valves andlung disorders.\nWhen the heart cannot pump enough blood, it tries\nto make up for this by becoming larger. By becomingenlarged (hypertrophic) the ventricle can contract morestrongly and pump more blood. When this happens, theheart chamber becomes larger and the muscle in the heartwall becomes thicker. The heart also compensates bypumping more often to improve blood output and circu-lation. The kidneys try to compensate for a failing heartby retaining more salt and water to increase the volumeof blood. This extra fluid can also cause edema. Eventu-ally, as the condition worsens over time these measuresare not enough to keep the heart pumping enough bloodneeded by the body. Kidneys often weaken under thesecircumstances, further aggravating the situation andmaking therapy more difficult.\nFor most people, heart failure is a chronic disease with\nno cure. However, it can be managed and treated with med-icines and changes in diet, exercise , and lifestyle habits.\nHeart transplantation is considered in some cases.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common causes of heart failure are:\n•coronary artery disease and heart attack (which may\nbe “silent”)\n• cardiomyopathy\n• high blood pressure ( hypertension )\n• heart valve disease• congenital heart disease•alcoholism and drug abuse\nThe most common cause of heart failure is coronary\nartery disease. In coronary artery disease, the arteriessupplying blood to the heart become narrowed orblocked. When blood flow to an area of the heart is com-pletely blocked, the person has a heart attack. Some heartattacks go unrecognized. The heart muscle suffers dam-age when its blood supply is reduced or blocked. If thedamage affects the heart’s ability to pump blood, heartfailure develops.\nCardiomyopathy is a general term for disease of the\nheart muscle. Cardiomyopathy may be caused by coro-nary artery disease and various other heart problems.\nSometimes the cause of cardiomyopathy cannot be found.In these cases the heart muscle disease is called idiopathiccardiomyopathy. Whatever the cause, cardiomyopathycan weaken the heart, leading to heart failure.\nHigh blood pressure is another common cause of\nheart failure. High blood pressure makes the heart workharder to pump blood. After a while, the heart cannotkeep up and the symptoms of heart failure develop.\nDefects of the heart valves, congenital heart dis-\neases, alcoholism, and drug abuse cause damage to theheart that can all lead to heart failure.\nA person with heart failure may experience the fol-\nlowing:\n• shortness of breath\n• frequent coughing, especially when lying down\n• swollen feet, ankles, and legs• abdominal swelling and pain\n• fatigue\n•dizziness or fainting\n• sudden death\nA person with left-sided heart failure may have short-\nness of breath and coughing caused by the fluid buildupin the lungs. Pulmonary edema may cause the person tocough up bubbly phlegm that contains blood. With right-\nsided heart failure, fluid build-up in the veins and bodytissues causes swelling in the feet, legs, and abdomen.When body tissues, such as organs and muscles, do notreceive enough oxygen and nutrients they cannot functionas well, leading to tiredness and dizziness.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of heart failure is based on:\n• symptoms• medical history\n•physical examination\n•chest x ray\n• electrocardiogram (ECG; also called EKG)\n• other imaging tests\n•cardiac catheterization\nA person’s symptoms can provide important clues to\nthe presence of heart failure. Shortness of breath whileengaging in activities and episodes of shortness of breaththat wake a person from sleep are classic symptoms ofheart failure. During the physical examination, the physi-cian listens to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope for\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1538Heart failuretelltale signs of heart failure. Irregular heart sounds, “gal-\nlops,” a rapid heart rate, and murmurs of the heart valvesmay be heard. If there is fluid in the lungs a cracklingsound may be heard. Rapid breathing or other changes inbreathing may also be present. Patients with heart failuremay also have a rapid pulse.\nBy pressing on the abdomen, the physician can feel\nif the liver is enlarged. The skin of the fingers and toesmay have a bluish tint and feel cool if not enough oxygenis reaching them.\nA chest x ray can show if there is fluid in the lungs\nand if the heart is enlarged. Abnormalities of heart valvesand other structures may also be seen on chest x ray.\nAn electrocardiogram gives information on the heart\nrhythm and the size of the heart. It can show if the heartchamber is enlarged and if there is damage to the heartmuscle from blocked arteries.KEY TERMS\nAngioplasty —A technique for treating blocked\ncoronary arteries by inserting a catheter with a tinyballoon at the tip into the artery and inflating it.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor —A\ndrug that relaxes blood vessel walls and lowersblood pressure.\nArrhythmias —Abnormal heartbeat.\nAtherosclerosis —Buildup of a fatty substance\ncalled a plaque inside blood vessels.\nCalcium channel blocker —A drug that relaxes\nblood vessels and lowers blood pressure.\nCardiac catheterization —A diagnostic test for eval-\nuating heart disease; a catheter is inserted into anartery and passed into the heart.\nCardiomyopathy —Disease of the heart muscle.\nCatheter —A thin, hollow tube.\nCongenital heart defects —Abnormal formation of\nstructures of the heart or of its major blood vesselspresent at birth.\nCongestive heart failure —A condition in which the\nheart cannot pump enough blood to supply thebody’s tissues with sufficient oxygen and nutrients;back up of blood in vessels and the lungs causesbuild up of fluid (congestion) in the tissues.Coronary arteries —Arteries that supply blood to\nthe heart muscle.\nCoronary artery bypass —Surgical procedure to\nreroute blood around a blocked coronary artery.\nCoronary artery disease —Narrowing or blockage\nof coronary arteries by atherosclerosis.\nDigitalis —A drug that helps the heart muscle to\nhave stronger pumping action.\nDiuretic —A type of drug that helps the kidneys\neliminate excess salt and water.\nEdema —Swelling caused by fluid buildup in tissues.\nEjection fraction —A measure of the portion of\nblood that is pumped out of a filled ventricle.\nHeart valves —Valves that regulate blood flow into\nand out of the heart chambers.\nHypertension —High blood pressure.\nHypertrophic —Enlarged.\nIdiopathic cardiomyopathy —Cardiomyopathy with-\nout a known cause.\nPulmonary edema —Buildup of fluid in the tissue of\nthe lungs.\nVasodilator —Any drug that relaxes blood vessel\nwalls.\nVentricles —The two lower chambers of the heart.\nBesides chest x ray, other imaging tests may help\nmake a diagnosis. Echocardiography uses sound waves\nto make images of the heart. These images can show if theheart wall or chambers are enlarged and if there are anyabnormalities of the heart valves. An echocardiogram canalso be used to find out how much blood the heart ispumping. It determines the amount of blood in the ventri-cle (ventricular volume) and the amount of blood the ven-tricle pumps each time it beats (called the ejection frac-tion). A healthy heart pumps at least one-half the amountof blood in the left ventricle with each heartbeat.Radionuclide ventriculography also measures the ejectionfraction by imaging with very low doses of an injectedradioactive substance as it travels through the heart.\nCardiac catheterization involves using a small tube\n(catheter) that is inserted through a blood vessel into theheart. It is used to measure pressure in the heart andamount of blood pumped by the heart. This test can help\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1539Heart failurefind abnormalities of the coronary arteries, heart valves,\nand heart muscle, and other blood vessels. Combinedwith echocardiography and other tests, cardiac catheteri-zation can help find the cause of heart failure. It is notalways necessary, however.\nTreatment\nHeart failure usually is treated with lifestyle changes\nand medicines. Sometimes surgery is needed to correctabnormalities of the heart or heart valves. Heart trans-plantation is a last resort to be considered in certain cases.\nDietary changes to maintain proper weight and\nreduce salt intake may be needed. Reducing salt intakehelps to lessen swelling in the legs, feet, and abdomen.Appropriate exercise may also be recommended, but it isimportant that heart failure patients only begin an exer-cise program with the advice of their doctors. Walking,bicycling, swimming, or low-impact aerobic exercisesmay be recommended. There are good heart rehabilita-\ntion programs at most larger hospitals.\nOther lifestyle changes that may reduce the symp-\ntoms of heart failure include stopping smoking or other\ntobacco use, eliminating or reducing alcohol consump-tion, and not using harmful drugs.\nOne or more of the following types of medicines\nmay be prescribed for heart failure:\n•diuretics\n• digitalis•vasodilators\n• beta blockers• angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE\ninhibitors)\n• angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)\n•calcium channel blockers\nDiuretics help eliminate excess salt and water from\nthe kidneys by making patients urinate more often. Thishelps reduce the swelling caused by fluid buildup in thetissues. Digitalis helps the heart muscle to have strongerpumping action. Vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, ARBs,and calcium channel blockers lower blood pressure andexpand the blood vessels so blood can move more easilythrough them. This action makes it easier for the heart topump blood through the vessels.\nSurgery is used to correct certain heart conditions\nthat cause heart failure. Congenital heart defects andabnormal heart valves can be repaired with surgery.Blocked coronary arteries can usually be treated withangioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.With severe heart failure, the heart muscle may\nbecome so damaged that available treatments do nothelp. Patients with this stage of heart failure are said tohave end-stage heart failure. Heart transplant is usuallyconsidered for patients with end-stage heart failure whenall other treatments have stopped working.\nPrognosis\nMost patients with mild or moderate heart failure\ncan be successfully treated with dietary and exercise pro-grams and the right medications. Many people are able toparticipate in normal daily activities and lead relativelyactive lives.\nPatients with severe heart failure may eventually\nhave to consider heart transplantation. Approximately50% of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failurelive for five years with the condition. Women with heartfailure usually live longer than men with heart failure.\nPrevention\nHeart failure is usually caused by the effects of some\ntype of heart disease. The best way to try to prevent heartfailure is to eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise,but many causes of heart failure cannot be prevented.People with risk factors for coronary disease (such ashigh blood pressure and high cholesterol levels) should\nwork closely with their physician to reduce their likeli-hood of heart attack and heart failure.\nHeart failure sometimes can be avoided by identify-\ning and treating any conditions that might lead to heartdisease. These include high blood pressure, alcoholism,and coronary artery disease. Regular blood pressurechecks and obtaining immediate medical care for symp-toms of coronary artery disease, such as chest pain, willhelp to get these conditions found and treated early,before they can damage the heart muscle.\nFinally, diagnosing and treating heart failure before\nthe heart becomes severely damaged can improve theprognosis. With proper treatment, many patients maycontinue to lead active lives for a number of years.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBellenir, Karen, and Peter D. Dresser, eds.

    "title": "Heart murmurs",
    "content": "Heart murmurs\nDefinition\nA heart murmur is an abnormal, extra sound during\nthe heartbeat cycle made by blood moving through theheart and its valves. It is detected by the physician’sexamination using a stethoscope.\nDescription\nA heart which is beating normal makes two sounds,\n“lubb” when the valves between the atria and ventriclesclose, and “dupp” when the valves between the ventriclesand the major arteries close. A heart murmur is a seriesof vibratory sounds made by turbulent blood flow. Thesounds are longer than normal heart sounds and can beheard between the normal sounds of the heart.\nHeart murmurs are common in children and can also\nresult from heart or valve defects. Nearly two thirds ofheart murmurs in children are produced by a normal heartand are harmless. This type of heart murmur is usuallycalled an “innocent” heart murmur. It can also be called“functional” or “physiologic.” Innocent heart murmursare usually very faint, intermittent, and occur in a smallarea of the chest. Pathologic heart murmurs may indicatethe presence of a serious heart defect. They are louder,continual, and may be accompanied by a click or gallop.\nSome heart murmurs are continually present; others\nhappen only when the heart is working harder than usual,including during exercise or certain types of illness.\nHeart murmurs can be diastolic or systolic. Those whichoccur during relaxation of the heart between beats arecalled diastolic murmurs. Those which occur during con-traction of the heart muscle are called systolic murmurs.The characteristics of the murmur may suggest specificalterations in the heart or its valves.\nCauses and symptoms\nInnocent heart murmurs are caused by blood flowing\nthrough the chambers and valves of the heart or the bloodvessels near the heart. Sometimes anxiety ,stress ,fever ,\nanemia, overactive thyroid, and pregnancy will causeinnocent murmurs that can be heard by a physician using\na stethoscope. Pathologic heart murmurs, however, arecaused by structural abnormalities of the heart. Theseinclude defective heart valves or holes in the walls of theheart. Valve problems are more common. Valves that donot open completely cause blood to flow through a small-er opening than normal, while those that do not closeproperly may cause blood to go back through the valve. Ahole in the wall between the left and right sides of theheart, called a septal defect, can cause heart murmurs.Some septal defects close on their own; others requiresurgery to prevent progressive damage to the heart.\nThe symptoms of heart murmurs differ depending on\nthe cause of the heart murmur. Innocent heart murmursand those which do not impair the function of the hearthave no symptoms. Murmurs that are due to severe abnor-malities of a heart valve may cause shortness of breath ,\ndizziness , chest pains, palpitations , and lung congestion.\nDiagnosis\nHeart murmurs can be heard when a physician listens\nto the heart through a stethoscope during a regular check-up. Very loud heart murmurs and those with clicks or extraheart sounds should be evaluated further. Infants with heartmurmurs who do not thrive, eat, or breath properly andolder children who lose consciousness suddenly or areintolerant to exercise should also be evaluated. If the mur-mur sounds suspicious, the physician may order a chest x\nray, an electrocardiogram, and an echocardiogram.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s\nactivity and may reveal muscle thickening, damage, or alack of oxygen. Electrodes covered with conducting jellyare placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. Theysend impulses of the heart’s activity through a monitor(oscilloscope) to a recorder which traces them on paper.The test takes about 10 minutes and is commonly per-formed in a physician’s office. An exercise ECG canreveal additional information.\nAn echocardiogram (cardiac ultrasound), may be\nordered to identify a structural problem that is causingthe heart murmur. An echocardiogram uses sound wavesto create an image of the heart’s chambers and valves.The technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer thenpresses it against the patient’s chest. The sound wavesare converted into an image that can be displayed on amonitor. Performed in a cardiology outpatient diagnosticlaboratory, the test takes 30 minutes to an hour.\nTreatment\nInnocent heart murmurs do not affect the patient’s\nhealth and require no treatment. Heart murmurs due to sep-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1541Heart murmurstal defects may require surgery. Those due to valvular\ndefects may require antibiotics to prevent infection during\ncertain surgical or dental procedures. Severely damaged ordiseased valves can be repaired or replaced through surgery.\nAlternative treatment\nIf a heart murmur requires surgical treatment, there\nare no alternative treatments, although there are alternativetherapies that are helpful for pre- and post-surgical supportof the patient. If the heart murmur is innocent, heart activi-ty can be supported using the herb hawthorn ( Crataegus\nlaevigata or C. oxyacantha ) or coenzyme Q10. These\nremedies improve heart contractility and the heart’s abilityto use oxygen. If the murmur is valvular in origin, herbsthat act like antibiotics as well as options that build resis-tance to infection in the valve areas may be considered.\nPrognosis\nMost children with innocent heart murmurs grow\nout of them by the time they reach adulthood.

While congenitalheart defects vary in their severity, most requiresurgery. Surgery is recommended for congenital heartdefects that result in a lack of oxygen, a poor quality oflife, or a patient who does not thrive. Some types ofcongenital heart defects that don’t cause symptoms aretreated surgically because they can lead to serious com-plications.\nPrecautions\nThere are many types of surgery for congenital heart\ndefects and many considerations in the decision to oper-ate. The patient’s cardiologist or surgeon will discussthese issues on an individual basis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1542Heart surgery for congenital defectsDescription\nThere are many types of congenital heart defects.\nMost obstruct the flow of blood in the heart, or the ves-sels near it, or cause an abnormal flow of blood throughthe heart. Rarer types include newborns born with oneventricle, one side of the heart that is not completelyformed, or the pulmonary artery and the aorta comingout of the same ventricle. Most congenital heart defectsrequire surgery during infancy or childhood. Recom-mended ages for surgery for the most common congeni-tal heart defects are:\n• atrial septal defects: during the preschool years\n•patent ductus arteriosus : between ages one and two\n•coarctation of the aorta : in infancy, if it’s sympto-\nmatic, at age four otherwise\n•tetralogy of Fallot : age varies, depending on the\npatient’s signs and symptoms\n•transposition of the great arteries : often in the first\nweeks after birth, but before the patient is 12 monthsold\nSurgical procedures seek to repair the defect as\nmuch as possible and restore circulation to as close tonormal as possible. Sometimes, multiple, serial, surgicalprocedures are necessary. Smaller congenital heartdefects can now be repaired in a cardiac catheterization\nlab instead of an operating room. Catheterization proce-dures include balloon atrial septostomy and balloon\nvalvuloplasty . Surgical procedures include arterial\nswitch, Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, Fontan proce-dure, Ross procedure, shunt procedure, and venousswitch or intra-atrial baffle.\nCatheterization procedures\nBalloon atrial septostomy and balloon valvuloplasty\nare cardiac catheterization procedures. Cardiac catheteri-zation procedures can save the lives of critically illneonates and in some cases eliminate or delay more inva-sive surgical procedures. It is expected that catheteriza-tion procedures will continue to replace more types ofsurgery for congenital heart defects in the future. A thintube called a catheter is inserted into an artery or vein inthe leg, groin, or arm and threaded into the area of theheart which needs repair. The patient receives a localanesthetic at the insertion site and is awake but sedatedduring the procedure.\nBALLOON ATRIAL SEPTOSTOMY. Balloon atrial sep-\ntostomy is the standard procedure for correcting transpo-sition of the great arteries; it is sometimes used inpatients with mitral, pulmonary, or tricupsid atresia (atre-sia is a defect that causes the blood to carry too little oxy-gen to the body). Balloon atrial septostomy enlarges the\natrial opening. A special balloon-tipped catheter is insert-ed into the right atrium and inflated to create a largeopening in the atrial septum.\nBALLOON VALVULOPLASTY. Balloon valvuloplasty\nuses a balloon-tipped catheter to open a narrowed heartvalve, improving the flow of blood. It is the procedure ofchoice in pulmonary stenosis and is sometimes used inaortic stenosis. Balloons made of plastic polymers areplaced at the end of the catheter and inflated to relieve theobstruction in the heart valve. Long-terms results areexcellent in most cases. The operative death rate is 2–4%.\nSurgical procedures\nThese procedures are performed under general anes-\nthesia. Some require the use of a heart-lung machine,which cools the body to reduce the need for oxygen andtakes over for the heart and lungs during the procedure.\nARTERIAL SWITCH. Arterial switch is performed to\ncorrect transposition of the great arteries, where the posi-tion of the pulmonary artery and the aorta are reversed.The procedure involves connecting the aorta to the leftventricle and the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle.\nDAMUS-KAYE-STANSEL PROCEDURE. Transposition\nof the great arteries can also be corrected by the Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, in which the pulmonary arteryis cut in two and connected to the ascending aorta andright ventricle.\nFONTAN PROCEDURE. For tricuspid atresia and pul-\nmonary atresia, the Fontan procedure connects the rightatrium to the pulmonary artery directly or with a conduit,and the atrial defect is closed. Survival is over 90%.\nPULMONARY ARTERY BANDING. Pulmonary artery\nbanding is narrowing the pulmonary artery with a band toreduce blood flow and pressure in the lungs. It is used forventricular septal defect , atrioventricular canal defect,\nand tricuspid atresia. Later, the band can be removed andthe defect corrected with open heart surgery.\nROSS PROCEDURE. To correct aortic stenosis, the\nRoss procedure grafts the pulmonary artery to the aorta.\nSHUNT PROCEDURE. For Tetralogy of Fallot, tricus-\npid atresia, or pulmonary atresia, the shunt procedurecreates a passage between blood vessels, sending bloodinto parts of the body that need it.\nVENOUS SWITCH. For transposition of the great\narteries, venous switch creates a tunnel inside the atria tore-direct oxygen-rich blood to the right ventricle andaorta and venous blood to the left ventricle and pul-monary artery.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1543Heart surgery for congenital defectsOTHER TYPES OF SURGERY. These surgical proce-\ndures are also used to treat common congenital heartdefects. A medium to large ventricular or atrial septal\ndefect can be closed by suturing it or covering it with a\nDacron patch. For patent ductus arteriosus, surgery con-sists of dividing the ductus into two and tying off theends. If performed within the patient’s first few years,there is practically no risk associated with this opera-tion. Surgery for coarctation of the aorta involves open-ing the chest wall, removing the defect, and reconnect-ing the ends of the aorta. If the defect is too long to bereconnected, a Dacron graft is used to replace the miss-KEY TERMS\nAtresia —A congenital defect in which the blood\npumped through the body has too little oxygen. Intricuspid atresia, the baby lacks a triscupid valve. Inpulmonary atresia, a pulmonary valve is missing.\nCoarctation of the aorta —A congenital defect in\nwhich severe narrowing or constriction of theaorta obstructs the flow of blood.\nCongenital heart defects —Congenital means con-\nditions which are present at birth. Congenitalheart disease includes a variety of defects thatbabies are born with.\nPatent ductus arteriosus —A congenital defect in\nwhich the temporary blood vessel connecting theleft pulmonary artery to the aorta in the fetus does-n’t close in the newborn.\nSeptal defects —These are holes in the septum, the\nmuscle wall separating the right and left sides ofthe heart.

This\ncongenital defect can occur in the pulmonary(lung) or aortic (the main heart artery) valve.\nTetralogy of Fallot —A cyanotic defect in which\nthe blood pumped through the body has too littleoxygen. Tetralogy of Fallot includes four defects: alarge hole between the ventricles, narrowing at orbeneath the pulmonary valve, an overly muscularright ventricle, and an aorta over the large hole.\nTransposition of the great arteries —A cyanotic\ndefect in which the blood pumped through thebody has too little oxygen. The pulmonary arteryand the aorta are reversed.ing piece. In uncomplicated cases, the risk of the opera-\ntion is 1–2%.\nPreparation\nBefore surgery for congenital heart defects, the\npatient will receive a complete evaluation, which includesa physical exam, a detailed family history, a chest x ray ,\nan electrocardiogram, an echocardiogram, and usuallycardiac catheterization. For six to eight hours before thesurgery, the patient cannot eat or drink anything. An elec-trocardiogram shows the heart’s activity and may reveal alack of oxygen. Electrodes covered with conducting jellyare placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs and theheart’s impulses are traced on paper. An echocardiogramuses sound waves to create an image of the heart’s cham-bers and valves. Gel is applied to a hand-held transducerand then pressed against the patient’s chest. Cardiaccatheterization is an invasive diagnostic technique used toevaluate the heart in which a long tube is inserted into ablood vessel and guided into the heart. A contrast solutionis injected to make the heart visible on x rays.\nAftercare\nAfter heart surgery for congenital defects, the patient\ngoes to an intensive care ward where he or she is connectedto a variety of tubes and monitors, including a ventilator.Patients are monitored every 15 minutes until vital signsare stable. Heart sounds, oxygenation, and the electrocar-diogram are monitored. Chest tubes will be checked toensure that they’re draining properly and there is no hemor-rhage. Pain medications will be administered. Complica-\ntions such as stroke , lung blood clots, and reduced blood\nflow to the kidneys will be watched for. After the ventilatorand breathing tube are removed, chest physical therapy\nand exercises to improve circulation will be started.\nRisks\nComplications from heart surgery for congenital\ndefects can be severe. They include shock , congestive\nheart failure , lack of oxygen or too much carbon diox-\nide in the blood, irregular heartbeat, stroke, infection,kidney damage, lung blood clot, low blood pressure,hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, and death.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Congenital Heart Disease.” In Current Medical Diagnosis and\nTreatment, 1998. 37th ed.

    "title": "Heart transplantation",
    "content": "Heart transplantation\nDefinition\nHeart transplantation, also called cardiac transplan-\ntation, is the replacement of a patient’s diseased orinjured heart with a healthy donor heart.\nPurpose\nHeart transplantation is performed on patients with\nend-stage heart failure or some other life-threatening heart\ndisease. Before a doctor recommends heart transplantationfor a patient, all other possible treatments for his or her dis-ease must have been tried. The purpose of heart transplan-tation is to extend and improve the life of a person whowould otherwise die from heart failure. Most patients whoreceive a new heart were so sick before transplantation thatthey could not live a normal life. Replacing a patient’s dis-eased heart with a healthy, functioning donor heart oftenallows the recipient to return to normal daily activities.\nPrecautions\nBecause healthy donor hearts are in short supply,\nstrict rules dictate who should or should not get a hearttransplant. Patients who have conditions that might causethe new heart to fail should not have a heart transplant.Similarly, patients who may be too sick to survive thesurgery or the side effects of the drugs they must take tokeep their new heart working would not be good trans-plant candidates.\nPatients who have any of the following conditions\nmay not be eligible for heart transplantation:\n• active infection\n• pulmonary hypertension\n• chronic lung disease with loss of more than 40% of\nlung function\n• untreatable liver or kidney disease• diabetes that has caused serious damage to vital organs\n• disease of the blood vessels in the brain, such as a\nstroke\n• serious disease of the arteries• mental illness or any condition that would make a\npatient unable to take the necessary medicines onschedule\n• continuing alcohol or drug abuse\nDescription\nPatients with end-stage heart disease that threatens\ntheir life even after medical treatment may be consideredfor heart transplantation. Potential candidates must havea complete medical examination before they can be puton the transplant waiting list. Many types of tests aredone, including blood tests, x rays, and tests of heart,lung, and other organ function. The results of these testsindicate to doctors how serious the heart disease is andwhether or not a patient is healthy enough to survive thetransplant surgery.\nOrgan waiting list\nA person approved for heart transplantation is\nplaced on the heart transplant waiting list of a heart trans-plant center. All patients on a waiting list are registeredwith the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).UNOS has organ transplant specialists who run a nation-al computer network that connects all the transplant cen-ters and organ-donation organizations.\nWhen a donor heart becomes available, information\nabout it is entered into the UNOS computer and com-pared to information from patients on the waiting list.The computer program produces a list of patients rankedaccording to blood type, size of the heart, and howurgently they need a heart. Because the heart must betransplanted as quickly as possible, the list of local\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1545Heart transplantationpatients is checked first for a good match. After that, a\nregional list, and then a national list, are checked. Thepatient’s transplant team of heart and transplant special-ists makes the final decision as to whether a donor heartis suitable for the patient.\nThe transplant procedure\nWhen a heart becomes available and is approved for\na patient, it is packed in a sterile cold solution and rushedto the hospital where the recipient is waiting.\nHeart transplant surgery involves the following basic\nsteps:\n• A specialist in cardiovascular anesthesia gives the\npatient general anesthesia.\n• Intravenous antibiotics are usually given to prevent\nbacterial wound infections.\n• The patient is put on a heart/lung machine, which per-\nforms the functions of the heart and lungs and pumpsthe blood to the rest of the body during surgery. Thisprocedure is called cardiopulmonary bypass.\n• After adequate blood circulation is established, the\npatient’s diseased heart is removed.\n• The donor heart is attached to the patient’s blood vessels.• After the blood vessels are connected, the new heart is\nwarmed up and begins beating. If the heart does notbegin to beat immediately, the surgeon may start it withan electrical shock.\n• The patient is taken off the heart/lung machine.• The new heart is stimulated to maintain a regular beat\nwith medications for two to five days after surgery,until the new heart functions normally on its own.\nHeart transplant recipients are given immunosup-\npressive drugs to prevent the body from rejecting the newheart. These drugs are usually started before or duringthe heart transplant surgery. Immunosuppressive drugskeep the body’s immune system from recognizing andattacking the new heart as foreign tissue. Normally,immune system cells recognize and attack foreign orabnormal cells, such as bacteria, cancer cells, and cells\nfrom a transplanted organ. The drugs suppress theimmune cells and allow the new heart to function proper-ly. However, they can also allow infections and otheradverse effects to occur to the patient.\nBecause the chance of rejection is highest during the\nfirst few months after the transplantation, recipients areusually given a combination of three or four immunosup-pressive drugs in high doses during this time. Afterwards,they must take maintenance doses of immunosuppressivedrugs for the rest of their lives.Cost and insurance coverage\nThe total cost for heart transplantation varies,\ndepending on where it is performed, whether transporta-tion and lodging are needed, and on whether there areany complications. The costs for the surgery and firstyear of care are estimated to be about $250,000. Themedical tests and medications after the first year costabout $21,000 per year.\nInsurance coverage for heart transplantation varies\ndepending on the policy. Most commercial insurancecompanies pay a certain percentage of heart transplantcosts. Medicare pays for heart transplants if the surgeryis performed at Medicare-approved centers. Medicaidpays for heart transplants in 33 states and in the Districtof Colombia.\nPreparation\nBefore patients are put on the transplant waiting list,\ntheir blood type is determined so a compatible donorheart can be found. The heart must come from a personwith the same blood type as the patient, unless it is bloodtype O. A blood type O heart can be transplanted into aperson with any type of blood.\nA panel reactive antibodies (PRA) test is also done\nbefore heart transplantation. This test tells doctors whetheror not the patient is at high risk for having a hyperacutereaction against a donor heart. A hyperacute reaction is astrong immune response against the new heart that hap-pens within minutes to hours after the new heart is trans-planted. If the PRA shows that a patient has a high risk forthis kind of reaction, then a crossmatch is done between apatient and a donor heart before transplant surgery. Acrossmatch checks how close the match is between thepatient’s tissue type and the tissue type of the donor heart.\nMost people are not high risk and a crossmatch usu-\nally is not done before the transplant because the surgerymust be done as quickly as possible after a donor heart isfound.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1546Heart transplantationNational Transplant Waiting List By Organ Type\n(June 2000)\nOrgan Needed Number Waiting\nKidney 48,349\nLiver 15,987Heart 4,139Lung 3,695Kidney-Pancreas 2,437Pancreas 942Heart-Lung 212Intestine 137While waiting for heart transplantation, patients are\ngiven treatment to keep the heart as healthy as possible.They are regularly checked to make sure the heart ispumping enough blood. Intravenous medications may beused to improve cardiac output. If these drugs are noteffective, a mechanical pump can help keep the heartfunctioning until a donor heart becomes available. Insert-ed through an artery into the aorta, the pump assists theheart in pumping blood.\nAftercare\nImmediately following surgery, patients are moni-\ntored closely in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hos-pital for 24–72 hours. Most patients need to receive oxy-gen for four to 24 hours following surgery. Blood pres-sure, heart function, and other organ functions are care-fully monitored during this time.\nHeart transplant patients start taking immunosup-\npressive drugs before or during surgery to preventimmune rejection of the heart. High doses of immuno-suppressive drugs are given at this time, because rejec-tion is most likely to happen within the first few monthsafter the surgery. A few months after surgery, lower doses\nof immunosuppressive drugs usually are given and mustbe taken for the rest of the patient’s life.\nFor six to eight weeks after the transplant surgery,\npatients usually come back to the transplant center twicea week for physical examinations and medical tests.These tests check for any signs of infection, rejection ofthe new heart, or other complications.\nIn addition to physical examination , the following\ntests may be done during these visits:\n• laboratory tests to check for infection\n• chest x ray to check for early signs of lung infection\n• electrocardiogram (ECG) to check heart function\n• echocardiogram to check the function of the ventricles\nin the heart\n• blood tests to check liver and kidney function• complete blood counts (CBC) to check the numbers of\nblood cells\n• taking of a small tissue sample from the donor heart\n(endomyocardial biopsy) to check for signs of rejection\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1547Heart transplantation\nA comparison of the old and new hearts of Dylan Stork, the smallest heart transplant recipient in the world.

Most of these rejec-tion situations are successfully treated.\nInfection can result from the surgery, but most infec-\ntions are a side effect of the immunosuppressive drugs.Immunosuppressive drugs keep the immune system fromattacking the foreign cells of the donor heart. However,the suppressed immune cells are also unable to adequate-ly fight bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.Microorganisms that normally do not affect persons withhealthy immune systems can cause dangerous infectionsin transplant patients taking immunosuppressive drugs.\nPatients are given antibiotics during surgery to pre-\nvent bacterial infection. Patients may also be given anantiviral drug to prevent virus infections. Patients whodevelop infections may need to have their immunosup-pressive drugs changed or the dose adjusted. Infectionsare treated with antibiotics or other drugs, depending onthe type of infection.\nOther complications that can happen immediately\nafter surgery are:\n• bleeding\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1548Heart transplantation• pressure on the heart caused by fluid in the space sur-\nrounding the heart (pericardial tamponade)\n• irregular heart beats\n• reduced cardiac output\n• increased amount of blood in the circulatory system\n• decreased amount of blood in the circulatory system\nAbout half of all heart transplant patients develop\ncoronary artery disease 1–5 years after the transplant.\nThe coronary arteries supply blood to the heart. Patientswith this problem develop chest pains called angina .\nOther names for this complication are coronary allograftvascular disease and chronic rejection.\nOutcomes\nHeart transplantation is an appropriate treatment for\nmany patients with end-stage heart failure. The outcomesof heart transplantation depend on the patient’s age,health, and other factors. About 73% of heart transplantpatients are alive four years after surgery.\nAfter transplant, most patients regain normal heart\nfunction, meaning the heart pumps a normal amount ofblood. A transplanted heart usually beats slightly fasterthan normal because the heart nerves are cut duringsurgery. The new heart also does not increase its rate asquickly during exercise . Even so, most patients feel\nmuch better and their capacity for exercise is dramatical-ly improved from before they received the new heart.About 85% of patients return to work and other dailyactivities. Many are able to participate in sports.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBellenir, Karen, and Peter D. Dresser, eds. Cardiovascular Dis-\neases and Disorders Sourcebook.

    "title": "Heart valve repair",
    "content": "Heart valve repair\nDefinition\nHeart valve repair is a surgical procedure used to cor-\nrect a malfunctioning heart valve. Repair usually involvesseparating the valve leaflets (the one-way “doors” of theheart valve which open and close to pump blood throughthe heart) or forcing them open with a balloon catheter, atechnique known as balloon valvuloplasty.\nPurpose\nTo correct damage to the mitral, aortic, pulmonary,\nor tricuspid heart valves caused by a systemic infection,endocarditis , rheumatic heart disease, a congenital heart\ndefect, or mitral and/or aortic valve disease. Damagedvalves may not open properly (stenosis) or they may notclose adequately (valve regurgitation, insufficiency, orincompetence).\nPrecautions\nPatients who have a diseased heart valve that is\nbadly scarred or calcified may be better candidates forvalve replacement surgery.\nDescription\nHeart valve repair is performed in a hospital setting\nby a cardiac surgeon. During valve repair surgery, thepatient’s heart is stopped, and his/her blood is circulatedoutside of the body through an extracorporeal bypass\ncircuit , also called heart-lung machine or just “the\npump.” The extracorporeal circuit consists of tubing andmedical devices that take over the function of thepatient’s heart and lungs during the procedure. As bloodpasses through the circuit, carbon dioxide is removedfrom the bloodstream and replaced with oxygen. Theoxygenated blood is then returned to the body. Othercomponents may also be added to the circuit to filter flu-ids from the blood or concentrate red blood cells.\nIn cases of valve disease where the leaflets have\nbecome fused together, a procedure known as a valvulo-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1549Heart valve repairtomy is performed. In valvulotomy, the leaflets of the\nvalves are surgically separated, or partially resected, withan incision to increase the size of the valve opening. Thesurgeon may also make adjustments to the chordae, thecord-like tissue that connects the valve leaflets to theventricle muscles, to improve valve function.\nAnother valve repair technique, balloon valvulo-\nplasty , is used in patients with pulmonary, aortic, and\nmitral valve stenosis to force open the valve. Valvulo-\nplasty is similar to a cardiac angioplasty procedure in\nthat it involves the placement of a balloon-tipped catheterinto the heart. Once inserted into the valve, the balloon isinflated and the valve dilates, or opens. Valvuloplastydoes not require a bypass circuit.\nPreparation\nA number of diagnostic tests may be administered\nprior to valve repair surgery. Magnetic resonance imag-\ning(MRI), echocardiogram, angiogram, and/or scinti-\ngram are used to help the surgeon get an accurate pictureof the extent of damage to the heart valve and the statusof the coronary arteries.\nAftercare\nThe patient’s blood pressure and vital signs will be\ncarefully monitored following a valve repair procedure,and he or she watched closely for signs of edema or con-\ngestive heart failure .KEY TERMS\nAngiogram —An angiogram uses a radiopaque\nsubstance, or dye, to make the blood vessels orarteries visible under x ray.\nCalcified —Hardened by calcium deposits.\nCatheter —A long, thin, flexible tube used in\nvalvuloplasty to widen the valve opening.\nEchocardiogram —Ultrasound of the heart; gener-\nates a picture of the heart through the use ofsoundwaves.\nEdema —Fluid accumulation in the body.\nScintigram —A nuclear angiogram; a scintigram\ninvolves injection of a radioactive substance intothe patient’s circulatory system. As the substancetravels through the body, a special scanning cam-era takes pictures.\nStenosis —Narrowing of the heart valve opening.Echocardiography or other diagnostic tests are\nordered for the patient at some point during or after surgeryto evaluate valvular function. A cardiac rehabilitation\nprogram may also be recommended to assist the patient inimproving exercise tolerance after the procedure.\nRisks\nAs with any invasive surgical procedure, hemorrhage,\ninfarction, stroke , heart attack, and infection are all possi-\nble complications of heart valve repair. The overall risksinvolved with the surgery depend largely on the complexi-ty of the procedure and physical condition of the patient.\nNormal results\nIdeally, a successful heart valve repair procedure\nwill return heart function to age-appropriate levels. Ifvalvuloplasty is performed, a follow-up valve repair orreplacement surgery may be necessary at a later date.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDeBakey, Michael E., and Antonio Gotto Jr. The New Living\nHeart.

    "title": "Heart valve replacement",
    "content": "Heart valve replacement\nDefinition\nHeart valve replacement is a surgical procedure dur-\ning which surgeons remove a damaged valve from theheart and substitute a healthy one.\nPurpose\nFour valves direct blood to and from the body through\nthe heart: the aortic valve, the pulmonic valve, the tricus-pid valve, and the mitral valve. Any of these valves maymalfunction because of a birth defect, infection, disease,or trauma. When the malfunction is so severe that it inter-feres with blood flow, an individual will have heart palpi-\ntations ,fainting spells, and/or difficulty breathing. These\nsymptoms will progressively worsen and cause death\nunless the damaged valve is replaced surgically.\nPrecautions\nAbnormal tricuspid valves usually are not replaced\nbecause they do not cause serious symptoms. Mildly or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1550Heart valve replacementeven moderately diseased mitral valves may not need to\nbe replaced because their symptoms are tolerable or theycan be treated with such drugs as beta blockers or calci-\num antagonists, which slow the heart rate. However, aseverely diseased mitral valve should be repaired orreplaced unless the person is too ill to tolerate the opera-tion because of another condition or illness.\nDescription\nAfter cutting through and separating the breastbone\nand ribs, surgeons place the patient on a cardiopul-monary bypass machine, which will perform the func-tions of the heart and lungs during the operation. Theythen open the heart and locate the faulty valve. Slicingaround the edges of the valve, they loosen it from the ten-dons that connect it to the rest of the heart and withdrawit. The new valve is inserted and sutured into place. Thepatient is then taken off the bypass machine and the chestis closed. The surgery takes three to five hours and iscovered by most insurance plans.\nThere are three types of replacement valves. One\nclass is made from animal tissue, usually a pig’s aorticvalve. Another is mechanical and is made of metal andplastic. The third, includes human valves that have beenremoved from an organ donor or that, rarely, are thepatient’s own pulmonic valve.\nThere is no single ideal replacement valve. The\nchoice between an animal valve or a mechanical valvedepends largely on the age of the patient. Because valvesobtained from animals have a life expectancy of 7–15years, they usually are given to older patients. Mechani-cal valves are used in younger patients because they aremore durable. Because mechanical valves are made offoreign material, however, blood clots can form on theirsurface. Therefore, patients who receive these valvesmust take anticoagulants the rest of their lives.\nDonor or pulmonic valves are given only to those\npatients who will deteriorate rapidly because of a nar-rowing of the passageway between the aorta and the leftventrical (aortic stenosis). These valves are limited intheir use because of the small supply available fromdonors and the strain that could be caused by removingand transferring a patient’s own pulmonic valve.\nPreparation\nBefore patients undergo heart valve replacement,\nthey must be evaluated carefully for any signs that theymay not tolerate the surgery.\nPreoperative tests include:\n• electrocardiography, which assesses the electrical activi-\nty of the heart• echocardiography, which uses sound waves to show the\nextent of the obstruction of blood flow through theheart and determine the degree of loss of heart functiondue to the malfunctioning valve\n• chest x ray, which provides an overall view of the\nanatomy of the heart and the lungs\nCardiac catheterization may also be performed to\nfurther asses the valve and to determine if coronarybypass surgery should also be done.\nAftercare\nA patient usually spends one to three days in the\nhospital intensive care unit (ICU) after heart valvereplacement so that the working of his or her heart andcirculation can be monitored closely. When first broughtto the ICU after surgery, the patient undergoes a neuro-logical examination to be sure he or she has not suffereda stroke . The patient continues to breathe by means of a\ntube inserted in the trachea at the time of surgery. Thismechanical ventilation is not withdrawn until the patientis fully awake from anesthesia, shows signs that he or shecan breathe satisfactorily without mechanical support,and has steadfast circulation.\nOnce stablilized, the patient is transferred to a stan-\ndard medical/surgical unit where he or she receives drugsthat will prevent excess fluid from building up around theheart. As soon as possible, the patient begins walking andexercising to regain strength. He or she is also placed ona diet that is low in salt and cholesterol.\nAfter being released from the hospital, the patient\ncontinues a daily exercise program that includes vigor-\nous walking, and he or she may also join a recommendedcardiac rehabilitation program. He or she usually can\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1551Heart valve replacement\nOpen heart surgery showing replacement of a valve. (Photo-\ngraph byDavid Leah. Photo Researchers. Reproduced by per-mission.)return to work or other normal activities within two\nmonths of the surgery.\nRisks\nComplications following heart valve replacement are\nnot common, but can be serious. All valves made fromanimal tissue will develop calcium deposits over time. Ifthese deposits hamper the function of the valve, it must bereplaced. Valves may become dislodged. Blood clots mayform on the surface of the substitute valve, break off intothe general circulation, and become wedged in an arterysupplying blood to the brain, kidneys, or legs. Theseblood clots may cause fainting spells, stroke, kidney fail-ure, or loss of circulation to the legs. These blood clotscan be treated with drugs or surgery.\nInfection of heart muscle affects up to 2% of patients\nwho have heart valve replacement. Such an infection istreated with intravenous antibiotics . If the infection per-\nsists, the new valve may have to be replaced.\nNormal results\nFew patients die as a result of the surgery. Approxi-\nmately 3% of all patients die during or immediately afterheart valve replacement, and less than 1% of patientsbelow the age of 65 die because of the operation. Thevast majority of patients who have heart valve replace-ment return to normal activity after the surgery.

It is the primary symptom of gas-troesophageal reflux, which is the movement of stomachacid into the esophagus. On rare occasions, it is due togastritis (stomach lining inflammation).\nDescription\nMore than one third of the population is afflicted by\nheartburn, with about one tenth afflicted daily. Infrequentheartburn is usually without serious consequences, butchronic or frequent heartburn (recurring more than twiceper week) can have severe consequences. Accordingly,early management is important.\nUnderstanding heartburn depends on understanding\nthe structure and action of the esophagus. The esophagusis a tube connecting the throat to the stomach. It is about10 in (25 cm) long in adults, lined with squamous (plate-like) epithelial cells, coated with mucus, and surroundedby muscles that push food to the stomach by sequentialwaves of contraction (peristalsis). The lower esophagealsphincter (LES) is a thick band of muscles that encirclesthe esophagus just above the uppermost part of the stom-ach. This sphincter is usually tightly closed and normallyopens only when food passes from the esophagus into thestomach. Thus, the contents of the stomach are normallykept from moving back into the esophagus.\nThe stomach has a thick mucous coating that pro-\ntects it from the strong acid it secretes into its interiorwhen food is present, but the much thinner esophagealcoating doesn’t provide protection against acid. Thus, ifthe LES opens inappropriately or fails to close complete-ly, and stomach contents leak into the esophagus, theesophagus can be burned by acid. The resulting burningsensation is called heartburn.\nOccasional heartburn has no serious long-lasting\neffects, but repeated episodes of gastroesophageal refluxcan ultimately lead to esophageal inflammation(esophagitis) and other damage. If episodes occur morefrequently than twice a week, and the esophagus isrepeatedly subjected to acid and digestive enzymes fromthe stomach, ulcerations, scarring, and thickening of theesophagus walls can result. This thickening of the esoph-agus wall causes a narrowing of the interior of the esoph-agus. Such narrowing affects swallowing and peristalticmovements. Repeated irritation can also result inchanges in the types of cells that line the esophagus. Thecondition associated with these changes is termed Bar-rett’s syndrome and can lead to esophageal cancer .\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nA number of different factors may contribute to LES\nmalfunction with its consequent gastroesophageal acidreflux:\n• The eating of large meals that distend the stomach can\ncause the LES to open inappropriately.\n• Lying down within two to three hours of eating can\ncause the LES to open.\n• Obesity, pregnancy , and tight clothing can impair the\nability of the LES to stay closed by putting pressure onthe abdomen.\n• Certain drugs, notably nicotine, alcohol, diazepam\n(Valium), meperidine (Demerol), theophylline, mor-phine, prostaglandins, calcium channel blockers ,\nnitrate heart medications, anticholinergic and adrener-gic drugs (drugs that limit nerve reactions), includingdopamine, can relax the LES.\n• Progesterone is thought to relax the LES.• Greasy foods and some other foods such as chocolate,\ncoffee, and peppermint can relax the LES.\n• Paralysis and scleroderma can cause the LES to mal-\nfunction.\n• Hiatus hernia may also cause heartburn according to\nsome gastroenterologists. (Hiatus hernia is a protrusionof part of the stomach through the diaphragm to a posi-tion next to the esophagus.).\nSymptoms\nHeartburn itself is a symptom. Other symptoms also\ncaused by gastroesophageal reflux can be associated withheartburn. Often heartburn sufferers salivate excessivelyor regurgitate stomach contents into their mouths, leav-ing a sour or bitter taste. Frequent gastroesophagealreflux leads to additional complications including diffi-cult or painful swallowing, sore throat , hoarseness,\ncoughing, laryngitis ,wheezing ,asthma ,pneumonia ,\ngingivitis, bad breath , and earache.\nDiagnosis\nGastroenterologists and internists are best equipped\nto diagnose and treat gastroesophageal reflux. Diagnosisis usually based solely on patient histories that reportheartburn and other related symptoms. Additional diag-nostic procedures can confirm the diagnosis and assess\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1553Heartburndamage to the esophagus, as well as monitor healing\nprogress. The following diagnostic procedures are appro-priate for anyone who has frequent, chronic, or difficult-to-treat heartburn or any of the complicating symptomsnoted in the previous paragraph.\nX rays taken after a patient swallows a barium sus-\npension can reveal esophageal narrowing, ulcerations ora reflux episode as it occurs. However, this procedurecannot detect the structural changes associated with dif-ferent degrees of esophagitis. This diagnostic procedurehas traditionally been called the “upper GI series” or“barium swallow” and costs about $250.00.\nEsophagoscopy is a newer procedure that uses a thin\nflexible tube to view the inside of the esophagus directly.It should be done by a gastroenterologist or gastrointesti-nal endoscopist and costs about $700. It gives an accu-rate picture of any damage present and gives the physi-cian the ability to distinguish between different degreesof esophagitis.\nOther tests may also be used. They include pressure\nmeasurements of the LES; measurements of esophagealacidity (pH), usually throughout a 24-hour period; andmicroscopic examination of biopsied tissue from theesophageal wall (to inspect esophageal cell structure forBarrett’s syndrome and malignancies).\nNote: A burning sensation in the chest is usually\nheartburn and is not associated with the heart. However,chest pain that radiates into the arms and is not accompa-\nnied by regurgitation is a warning of a possible seriousheart problem. Anyone with these symptoms should con-tact a doctor immediately.Treatment\nDrugs\nOccasional heartburn is probably best treated with\nover-the-counter antacids . These products go straight to\nthe esophagus and immediately begin to decrease acidity.However, they should not be used as the sole treatmentfor heartburn sufferers who either have two or moreepisodes per week or who suffer for periods of over threeweeks. There is a risk of kidney damage and other meta-bolic changes.\nH2 blockers (histamine receptor blockers, such as\nPepsid AC, Zantac, Tagamet) decrease stomach acid pro-duction and are effective against heartburn. H2 blockertreatment also allows healing of esophageal damage butis not very effective when there is a high degree of dam-age. It takes 30–45 minutes for these drugs to take effect,so they must be taken prior to an episode. Thus, theyshould be taken daily, usually two to four times per dayfor several weeks. Six to twelve weeks of standard-dosetreatment relieves symptoms in about half the patients.Higher doses relieve symptoms in a greater fraction ofthe population, but at least 25% of heartburn sufferers arenot helped by H2 blockers.\nProton-pump inhibitors also inhibit acid production\nby the stomach, but are much more effective than H2blockers for some people. They are also more effective inaiding the healing process. Esophagitis is healed in about90% of the patients undergoing proton-pump inhibitortreatment.\nThe long-term effects of inhibiting stomach acid\nproduction are unknown. Without the antiseptic effectsof a consistently very acidic stomach environment, usersof H2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors may becomemore susceptible to bacterial and viral infection. Absorp-tion of some drugs is also lowered by this less-acidicenvironment.\nProkinetic agents (also known as motility drugs) act\non the LES, stimulating it to close more tightly, therebykeeping stomach contents out of the esophagus. It is notknown how effectively these drugs promote healing.Some of the early motility drugs had serious neurologicalside effects, but a new drug, cisapride, seems to act onlyon digestive system nerve connections.\nSurgery\nFundoplication, a surgical procedure to increase\npressure on the LES by stretching and wrapping theupper part of the stomach around the sphincter, is a treat-ment of last resort. About 10% of heartburn sufferersundergo this procedure. It is not always effective and itseffectiveness may decrease over time, especially several\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1554Heartburn\nAn illustration of foaming antacid on top of the contents of\na human stomach.

Dr. Robert Marks and his colleagues\nat the University of Alabama reported in 1997 on thelong-term outcome of this procedure. They found that64% of the patients in their study who had fundoplicationbetween 1992 and 1995 still suffered from heartburn andreported an impaired quality of life after the surgery.\nHowever, laparoscopy (an examination of the inte-\nrior of the abdomen by means of the laparoscope) nowprovides hope for better outcomes. Fundoplication per-formed with a laparoscope is less invasive. Five smallincisions are required instead of one large incision.Patients recover faster, and it is likely that studies willshow they suffer from fewer surgical complications.\nAlternative treatment\nPrevention, as outlined below, is a primary feature\nfor heartburn management in alternative medicine andtraditional medicine. Dietary adjustments can eliminatemany causes of heartburn.\nHerbal remedies include bananas, aloe vera gel,\nchamomile ( Matricaria recutita ), ginger ( Zingiber offici-\nnale), and citrus juices, but there is little agreement here.\nFor example, ginger, which seems to help some people,is claimed by other practitioners to cause heartburn and\nis thought to relax the LES.

    "content": "Heat cramps seeHeat disordersHeat disorders\nDefinition\nHeat disorders are a group of physically related ill-\nnesses caused by prolonged exposure to hot tempera-tures, restricted fluid intake, or failure of temperatureregulation mechanisms of the body. Disorders of heatexposure include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke (also called sunstroke). Hyperthermia is the gen-\neral name given to heat-related illnesses. The two mostcommon forms of hyperthermia are heat exhaustion andheat stroke, which is especially dangerous and requiresimmediate medical attention.\nDescription\nHeat disorders are harmful to people of all ages, but\ntheir severity is likely to increase as people age. Heatcramps in a 16-year-old may be heat exhaustion in a 45-year-old and heat stroke in a 65-year-old. The body’stemperature regulating mechanisms rely on the thermalregulating centers in the brain. Through these complexcenters, the body tries to adapt to high temperatures byadjusting the amount of salt in the perspiration. Salthelps the cells in body tissues retain water. In hot weath-er, a healthy body will lose enough water to cool thebody while creating the lowest level of chemical imbal-ance. Regardless of extreme weather conditions, thehealthy human body keeps a steady temperature ofapproximately 98.6°F (37°C). In hot weather, or duringvigorous activity, the body perspires. As perspirationevaporates from the skin, the body is cooled. If the bodyloses too much salt and fluids, the symptoms of dehy-\ndration can occur.\nHeat cramps\nHeat cramps are the least severe of the heat-related\nillnesses. This heat disorder is often the first signal thatthe body is having difficulty with increased temperature.Individuals exposed to excessive heat should think ofheat cramps as a warning sign to a potential heat-relatedemergency.\nHeat exhaustion\nHeat exhaustion is a more serious and complex con-\ndition than heat cramps. Heat exhaustion can result fromprolonged exposure to hot temperatures, restricted fluidintake, or failure of temperature regulation mechanismsof the body. It often affects athletes, firefighters, con-struction workers, factory workers, and anyone whowears heavy clothing in hot humid weather.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1556Heat disordersHeat stroke\nHeat exhaustion can develop rapidly into heat\nstroke. Heat stroke can be life threatening and becausethe percentage of victims dying from heat stroke is veryhigh, immediate medical attention is critical when prob-lems first begin. Heat stroke, like heat exhaustion, is alsoa result of prolonged exposure to hot temperatures,restricted fluid intake, or failure of temperature regula-tion mechanisms of the body. However, the severity ofimpact on the body is much greater with heat stroke.\nCauses and symptoms\nHeat cramps\nHeat cramps are painful muscle spasms caused by\nthe excessive loss of salts (electrolytes), due to heavyperspiration. The muscle tissue becomes less flexible,causing pain , difficult movement, and involuntary tight-\nness. Heavy exertion in extreme heat, restricted fluidintake, or failure of temperature regulation mechanismsof the body may lead to heat cramps. This disorderoccurs more often in the legs and abdomen than in otherareas of the body. Individuals at higher risk are thoseworking in extreme heat, elderly people, young children,people with health problems, and those who are unableto naturally and properly cool their bodies. Individualswith poor circulation and who take medications to reduceexcess body fluids can be at risk when conditions are hotand humid.\nHeat exhaustion\nHeat exhaustion is caused by exposure to high heat\nand humidity for many hours, resulting in excessive lossof fluids and salts through heavy perspiration. The skinmay appear cool, moist, and pale. The individual maycomplain of headache and nausea with a feeling of over-\nall weakness and exhaustion. Dizziness , faintness, and\nmental confusion are often present, as is rapid and weakpulse. Breathing becomes fast and shallow. Fluid lossreduces blood volume and lowers blood pressure. Yellowor orange urine often is a result of inadequate fluidintake, along with associated intense thirst. Insufficientwater and salt intake or a deficiency in the production ofsweat place an individual at high risk for heat exhaustion.\nHeat stroke\nHeat stroke is caused by overexposure to extreme\nheat, resulting in a breakdown in the body’s heat regulat-ing mechanisms. The body’s temperature reaches a dan-gerous level, as high as 106°F (41.1°C). An individualwith heat stroke has a body temperature higher than104°F (40°C). Other symptoms include mental confusionKEY TERMS\nConvulsions —Also termed seizures; a sudden vio-\nlent contraction of a group of muscles.\nElectrolytes —An element or compound that when\nmelted or dissolved in water dissociates into ionsand is able to conduct an electrical current. Care-ful and regular monitoring of electrolytes andintravenous replacement of fluid and electrolytesare part of the acute care in many illnesses.\nRehydration —The restoration of water or fluid to a\nbody that has become dehydrated.\nwith possible combativeness and bizarre behavior, stag-\ngering, and faintness.\nThe pulse becomes strong and rapid (160–180 beats\nper minute) with the skin taking on a dry and flushedappearance. There is often very little perspiration. Theindividual can quickly lose consciousness or have con-vulsions. Before heat-stroke, an individual suffers fromheat exhaustion and the associated symptoms. When thebody can no longer maintain a normal temperature, heatexhaustion becomes heat-stroke. Heat stroke is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediateinitiation of life-saving measures.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of heat cramps usually involves the\nobservation of individual symptoms such as musclecramping and thirst. Diagnosis of heat exhaustion or heatstroke, however, may require a physician to review themedical history, document symptoms, and obtain a bloodpressure and temperature reading. The physician mayalso take blood and urine samples for further laboratorytesting. A test to measure the body’s electrolytes can alsogive valuable information about chemical imbalancescaused by the heat-related illness.\nTreatment\nHeat cramps\nThe care of heat cramps includes placing the indi-\nvidual at rest in a cool environment, while giving coolwater with a teaspoon of salt per quart, or a commercialsports drink. Usually rest and liquids are all that is need-ed for the patient to recover. Mild stretching and massag-ing of the muscle area follows once the conditionimproves. The individual should not take salt tablets,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1557Heat disorderssince this may actually worsen the condition. When the\ncramps stop, the person can usually start activity again ifthere are no other signs of illness. The individual needsto continue drinking fluids and should be watched care-fully for further signs of heat-related illnesses.\nHeat exhaustion\nThe individual suffering from heat exhaustion\nshould stop all physical activity and move immediatelyto a cool place out of the sun, preferably a cool, air-con-ditioned location. She or he should then lay down withfeet slightly elevated, remove or loosen clothing, anddrink cold (but not iced), slightly salty water or commer-cial sports drink. Rest and replacement of fluids and saltis usually all the treatment that is needed, and hospital-ization is rarely required. Following rehydration, the per-son usually recovers rapidly.\nHeat stroke\nSimply moving the individual afflicted with heat\nstroke to a cooler place is not enough to reverse the inter-nal overheating. Emergency medical assistance shouldbe called immediately. While waiting for help to arrive,quick action to lower body temperature must take place.Treatment involves getting the victim to a cool place,loosening clothes or undressing the heat stroke victim,and allowing air to circulate around the body. The nextimportant step is wrapping the individual in wet towelsor clothing, and placing ice packs in areas with the great-est blood supply. These areas include the neck, under thearm and knees, and in the groin. Once the patient is undermedical care, cooling treatments may continue as\nappropriate. The victim’s body temperature will be moni-tored constantly to guard against overcooling. Breathingand heart rate will be monitored closely, and fluids andelectrolytes will be replaced intravenously. Anti-convul-sant drugs may be given. After severe heat stroke, bedrest may be recommended for several days.\nPrognosis\nPrompt treatment for heat cramps is usually very\neffective with the individual returning to activity there-after. Treatment of heat exhaustion usually brings fullrecovery in one to two days. Heatstroke is a very seriouscondition and its outcome depends upon general healthand age. Due to the high internal temperature of heatstroke, permanent damage to internal organs is possible.\nPrevention\nBecause heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke\nhave a cascade effect on each other, the prevention of theonset of all heat disorders is similar. Avoid strenuous exer-\ncisewhen it is very hot. Individuals exposed to extreme\nheat conditions should drink plenty of fluids. Wearinglight and loose-fitting clothing in hot weather is important,regardless of the activity. It is important to consume wateroften and not to wait until thirst develops. If perspiration isexcessive, fluid intake should be increased. When urineoutput decreases, fluid intake should also increase. Eatinglightly salted foods can help replace salts lost through per-spiration. Ventilation in any working areas in warm weath-er must be adequate. This can be achieved as simply asopening a window or using an electric fan. Proper ventila-tion will promote adequate sweat evaporation to cool theskin. Sunblocks and sunscreens with a protection factor of\n15 (SPF 15) can be very helpful when one is exposed toextreme direct sunlight.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Red Cross. Standard First Aid.

    "content": "Heat treatments\nDefinition\nHeat treatments are applications of therapeutic ther-\nmal agents to specific body areas experiencing injury ordysfunction.\nPurpose\nThe general purpose of a heat treatment is to\nincrease the extensibility of soft tissues, remove toxinsfrom cells, enhance blood flow, increase function of thetissue cells, encourage muscle relaxation, and helprelieve pain . There are two types of heat treatments:\nsuperficial and deep. Superficial heat treatments applyheat to the outside of the body. Deep heat treatmentsdirect heat toward specific inner tissues through ultra-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1558Heat treatmentssound or by electric current.Heat treatments are benefi-\ncial prior to exercise , providing a warm-up effect to the\nsoft tissues involved.\nPrecautions\nHeat treatments should not be used on individuals\nwith circulation problems, heat intolerance, or lack ofsensation in the affected area. Low blood circulation maycontribute to heat-related injuries. Heat treatments alsoshould not be used on individuals afflicted with heart,lung, or kidney diseases. Deep heat treatments should notbe used on areas above the eye, heart, or on a pregnantpatient. Deep heat treatments over areas with metal sur-gical implants should be avoided in case of rapid temper-ature increase and subsequent injury.\nDescription\nThere are four different ways to convey heat:\n• Conduction is the transfer of heat between two objects\nin direct contact with each other.\n• Conversion is the transition of one form of energy to heat.\n• Radiation involves the transmission and absorption of\nelectromagnetic waves to produce a heating effect.\n• Convection occurs when a liquid or gas moves past a\nbody part creating heat.\nHot packs, water bottles, and heating pads\nHot packs are a very common form of heat treatment\nutilizing conduction as a form of heat transfer. Moist heatpacks are readily available in most hospitals, physicaltherapy centers, and athletic training rooms. Treatmenttemperature should not exceed 131°F (55°C). The packis used over multiple layers of toweling to achieve acomfortable warming effect for approximately 30 min-utes. More recently, several manufacturers have devel-oped packs that may be warmed in a microwave over aspecified amount of time prior to use.\nHot-water bottles are another form of superficial\nheat treatment. The bottles are filled half way with hotwater between 115–125°F (46.1–52°C). Covered by aprotective toweling, the hot-water bottle is placed on thetreatment area and left until the water has cooled off.\nElectrical heating pads continue to be used, however\nbecause of the need for an electrical outlet, safety andconvenience become an issue.\nParaffin\nParaffin, a conductive form of superficial heat, is\noften used for heating uneven surfaces of the body suchas the hands. It consists of melted paraffin wax and min-\neral oil. Paraffin placed in a small bath unit becomessolid at room temperature and is used as a liquid heattreatment when heated at 126–127.4°F (52–53°C). Themost common form of paraffin application is called thedip and wax method. In this technique, the patient willdip eight to 12 times and then the extremity will be cov-ered with a plastic bag and a towel for insulation. Mosttreatment sessions are about 20 minutes.\nHydrotherapy\nHydrotherapy is used in a form of heat treatment\nfor many musculoskeletal disorders. The hydrotherapytanks and pools are all generally set at warm tempera-tures, never exceeding 150°F (65.6°C). Because thepatient often performs resistance exercises while in thewater, higher water temperatures become a concern asthe treatment becomes more physically draining.Because of this, many hydrotherapy baths are now beingset at 95–110°F (35–43.3°C). There are also units avail-able with moveable turbine jets, which provide a lightmassage effect. Hydrotherapy is helpful as a warm-upprior to exercise.\nFluidotherapy\nFluidotherapy is a form of heat treatment developed\nin the 1970s. It is a dry heat modality consisting of cellu-lose particles suspended in air. Units come in differentsizes and some are restricted to only treating a hand orfoot. The turbulence of the gas-solid mixture providesthermal contact with objects that are immersed in themedium. Temperatures of this treatment range from110–123°F (43.3–50.5°C). Fluidotherapy allows thepatient to exercise the limb during the treatment, and alsomassages the limb, increasing blood flow.\nUltrasound\nUltrasound heat treatments penetrate the body to pro-\nvide relief to inner tissue. Ultrasound energy comes fromthe acoustic or sound spectrum and is undetectable to thehuman ear. By using conducting agents such as gel ormineral oil, the ultrasound transducer warms areas of themusculoskeletal system Some areas of the musculoskele-tal system absorb ultrasound better that others. Muscletissue and other connective tissue such as ligaments andtendons absorb this form of energy very well, however fatabsorbs to a much lesser degree. Ultrasound has a rela-tively longlasting effect, continuing up to one hour.\nDiathermy\nDiathermy is another deep heat treatment. An elec-\ntrode drum is used to apply heat to an affected area. It\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1559Heat treatmentsconsists of a wire coil surrounded by dead space and\nother insulators such as a plastic housing. Plenty of tow-eling must be layered between the unit and the patient.This device is unique in that it utilizes the basis of a mag-netic field on connective tissues. One advantage ofdiathermy over various other heat treatments is that fatdoes resist an electrical field, which is not the case with amagnetic field. It is found to be helpful with those expe-riencing chronic low back pain and muscle spasms.\nPrior to ultrasound technology, diathermy was a popularheat therapy of the 1940s–1960s.\nPreparation\nBefore administering any form of heat treatment,\nheat sensitivity is accessed and the skin over the affectedarea is cleansed. When a patient is undergoing any formof heat treatment, supervision should always be presentespecially in the treatment of hydrotherapy.\nAftercare\nOnce the heat treatment has been completed, any\nsymptoms of dizziness and nausea should be noted and\ndocumented along with any skin irritations or discoloringnot present prior to the heat treatment. A one hour inter-val between treatments should be adhered to in order toavoid restriction of blood flow.\nRisks\nAll heat treatments have the potential of tissue dam-\nage resulting from excessive temperatures. Proper insu-lation and treatment duration should be carefully admin-istered for each method. Overexposure during a superfi-cial heat treatment may result in redness, blisters, burns ,\nor reduced blood circulation. During ultrasound therapy,excessive treatment over bony areas with little soft tis-sue (such as hand, feet, and elbow) can cause excessiveheat resulting in pain and possible tissue damage. Expo-sure to the electrode drum during diathermy may pro-duce hot spots.\nResources\nBOOKS\nScully, Rosemary M., and Marylou R. Barnes. Physical Thera-\npy.Philadelphia: J. B.

    "title": "Heavy metal poisoning",
    "content": "Heavy metal poisoning\nDefinition\nHeavy metal poisoning is the toxic accumulation of\nheavy metals in the soft tissues of the body.\nDescription\nHeavy metals are chemical elements that have a spe-\ncific gravity (a measure of density) at least five times thatof water. The heavy metals most often implicated inhuman poisoning are lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmi-um. Some heavy metals, such as zinc, copper, chromium,iron, and manganese, are required by the body in smallamounts, but these same elements can be toxic in largerquantities.\nHeavy metals may enter the body in food, water,\nor air, or by absorption through the skin. Once in thebody, they compete with and displace essential miner-\nalssuch as zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium, and\ninterfere with organ system function. People maycome in contact with heavy metals in industrial work,pharmaceutical manufacturing, and agriculture. Chil-dren may be poisoned as a result of playing in contam-inated soil.\nCauses and symptoms\nSymptoms will vary, depending on the nature and\nthe quantity of the heavy metal ingested. Patients maycomplain of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , stomach pain ,\nheadache , sweating, and a metallic taste in the mouth.\nDepending on the metal, there may be blue-black lines inthe gum tissues. In severe cases, patients exhibit obviousimpairment of cognitive, motor, and language skills. Theexpression “mad as a hatter” comes from the mercurypoisoning prevalent in 17th century France among hat-makers who soaked animal hides in a solution of mer-curic nitrate to soften the hair.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1560Heavy metal poisoningDiagnosis\nHeavy metal poisoning may be detected using blood\nand urine tests, hair and tissue analysis, or x ray.\nIn childhood, blood lead levels above 80 µg/dL gen-\nerally indicate lead poisoning , however, significantly\nlower levels (>.30 µg/dL) can cause mental retardation\nand other cognitive and behavioral problems in affectedchildren. The Centers for Disease Control and Peventionconsiders a blood lead level of 10 µg/dL or higher in chil-dren a cause for concern. In adults, symptoms of leadpoisoning are usually seen when blood lead levels exceed80 µg/dL for a number of weeks.\nBlood levels of mercury should not exceed 3.6\nµg/dL, while urine levels should not exceed 15 µg/dL.Symptoms of mercury poisoning may be seen when mer-cury levels exceed 20 µg/dL in blood and 60 µg/dL inurine. Mercury levels in hair may be used to gauge theseverity of chronic mercury exposure.\nSince arsenic is rapidly cleared from the blood,\nblood arsenic levels may not be very useful in diagnosis.Arsenic in the urine (measured in a 24-hour collectionfollowing 48 hours without eating seafood) may exceed50 µg/dL in people with arsenic poisoning. If acutearsenic poisoning is suspected, an x ray may revealingested arsenic in the abdomen (since arsenic is opaqueto x rays). Arsenic may also be detected in the hair andnails for months following exposure.\nCadmium toxicity is generally indicated when urine\nlevels exceed 10 µg/dL of creatinine and blood levelsexceed 5 µg/dL.\nTreatment\nThe treatment for most heavy metal poisoning is\nchelation therapy . A chelating agent specific to the\nmetal involved is given either orally, intramuscularly, orintravenously. The three most common chelating agentsare calcium disodium edetate, dimercaprol (BAL), andpenicillamine. The chelating agent encircles and binds tothe metal in the body’s tissues, forming a complex; thatcomplex is then released from the tissue to travel in thebloodstream. The complex is filtered out of the blood bythe kidneys and excreted in the urine. This process maybe lengthy and painful, and typically requires hospital-ization. Chelation therapy is effective in treating lead,mercury, and arsenic poisoning, but is not useful in treat-ing cadmium poisoning. To date, no treatment has beenproven effective for cadmium poisoning.\nIn cases of acute mercury or arsenic ingestion,\nvomiting may be induced. Washing out the stomach(gastric lavage) may also be useful. The patient mayalso require treatment such as intravenous fluids forKEY TERMS\nChelation —The process by which a molecule\nencircles and binds to a metal and removes it fromtissue.\nHeavy metal —One of 23 chemical elements that\nhas a specific gravity (a measure of density) at leastfive times that of water.\ncomplications of poisoning such as shock , anemia, and\nkidney failure.\nPrognosis\nThe chelation process can only halt further effects of\nthe poisoning; it cannot reverse neurological damagealready sustained.\nPrevention\nBecause exposure to heavy metals is often an\noccupational hazard, protective clothing and respira-tors should be provided and worn on the job. Protec-tive clothing should then be left at the work site andnot worn home, where it could carry toxic dust tofamily members. Industries are urged to reduce orreplace the heavy metals in their processes whereverpossible. Exposure to environmental sources of lead,including lead-based paints, plumbing fixtures, vehi-cle exhaust, and contaminated soil, should be reducedor eliminated.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

(Photo Researchers. Reproduced by permis-\nsion.)Heel spurs\nDefinition\nA heel spur is a bony projection on the sole (plantar)\nregion of the heel bone (also known as the calcaneous).This condition may accompany or result from severecases of inflammation to the structure called plantar fas-cia. This associated plantar fascia is a fibrous band ofconnective tissue on the sole of the foot, extending fromthe heel to the toes.\nDescription\nHeel spurs are a common foot problem resulting\nfrom excess bone growth on the heel bone. The bonegrowth is usually located on the underside of the heelbone, extending forward to the toes. One explanation forthis excess production of bone is a painful tearing of theplantar fascia connected between the toes and heel. Thiscan result in either a heel spur or an inflammation of theplantar fascia, medically termed plantar fascitis. Becausethis condition is often correlated to a decrease in the archof the foot, it is more prevalent after the age of six toeight years, when the arch is fully developed.\nCauses and symptoms\nOne frequent cause of heel spurs is an abnormal\nmotion and mal-alignment of the foot called pronation.For the foot to function properly, a certain degree ofpronation is required. This motion is defined as aninward action of the foot, with dropping of the insidearch as one plants the heel and advances the weight dis-tribution to the toes during walking. When foot prona-tion becomes extreme from the foot turning in and drop-ping beyond the normal limit, a condition known asexcessive pronation creates a mechanical problem in thefoot. In some cases the sole or bottom of the foot flattensand becomes unstable because of this excess pronation,especially during critical times of walking and athleticactivities. The portion of the plantar fascia attached intothe heel bone or calcaneous begins to stretch and pullaway from the heel bone.\nAt the onset of this condition, pain and swelling\nbecome present, with discomfort particularly noted aspushing off with the toes occurs during walking. Thismovement of the foot stretches the fascia that is alreadyirritated and inflamed. If this condition is allowed to con-tinue, pain is noticed around the heel region because ofthe newly formed bone, in response to the stress . This\nresults in the development of the heel spur. It is commonamong athletes and others who run and jump a signifi-cant amount.An individual with the lower legs angulating inward, a\ncondition called genu valgus or “knock knees,” can have atendency toward excessive pronation. As a result, this toocan lead to a fallen arch resulting in plantar fascitis and heelspurs. Women tend to have more genu valgus than men do.Heel spurs can also result from an abnormally high arch.\nOther factors leading to heel spurs include a sudden\nincrease in daily activities, an increase in weight, or achange of shoes. Dramatic increase in training intensityor duration may cause plantar fascitis. Shoes that are tooflexible in the middle of the arch or shoes that bendbefore the toe joints will cause an increase in tension inthe plantar fascia and possibly lead to heel spurs.\nThe pain this condition causes forces an individual to\nattempt walking on his or her toes or ball of the foot toavoid pressure on the heel spur. This can lead to othercompensations during walking or running that in turncause additional problems to the ankle, knee, hip, or back.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1562Heel spursDiagnosis\nA thorough medical history and physical exam by a\nphysician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis ofheel spurs and other foot conditions. X rays of the heelarea are helpful, as excess bone production will be visible.\nTreatment\nConservative\nHeel spurs and plantar fascitis are usually controlled\nwith conservative treatment. Early intervention includesstretching the calf muscles while avoiding re-injuring theplantar fascia. Decreasing or changing activities, losingexcess weight, and improving the proper fitting of shoesare all important measures to decrease this commonsource of foot pain. Modification of footwear includesshoes with a raised heel and better arch support. Shoeorthotics recommended by a healthcare professional areoften very helpful in conjunction with exercises toincrease strength of the foot muscles and arch. Theorthotic prevents excess pronation and lengthening of theplantar fascia and continued tearing of this structure. Toaid in this reduction of inflammation, applying ice for10–15 minutes after activities and use of anti-inflamma-tory medication can be helpful. Physical therapy can bebeneficial with the use of heat modalities, such as ultra-sound that creates a deep heat and reduces inflammation.If the pain caused by inflammation is constant, keepingthe foot raised above the heart and/or compressed bywrapping with an ace bandage will help.\nCorticosteroid injections are also frequently used to\nreduce pain and inflammation. Taping can help speed thehealing process by protecting the fascia from reinjury,especially during stretching and walking.\nHeel surgery\nWhen chronic heel pain fails to respond to conserva-\ntive treatment, surgical treatment may be necessary. Heelsurgery can provide relief of pain and restore mobility.The type of procedure used is based on examination andusually consists of releasing the excessive tightness ofthe plantar fascia, called a plantar fascia release. Depend-ing on the presence of excess bony build up, the proce-dure may or may not include removal of heel spurs. Sim-ilar to other surgical interventions, there are variousmodifications and surgical enhancements regardingsurgery of the heel.\nAlternative treatment\nAcupuncture and accupressure have been used to\naddress the pain of heel spurs, in addition to using fric-KEY TERMS\nCalcaneous —The heel bone.\nGenu valgus —Deformity in which the legs are\ncurved inward so that the knees are close together,nearly or actually knocking as a person walks withankles widely apart of each other.\nPlantar fascia —A tough fibrous band of tissue sur-\nrounding the muscles of the sole of the foot. Alsocalled plantar aponeurosis.\nPronation —The lowering or descending of the\ninner edge of the foot by turning the entire footoutwards.\ntion massage to help break up scar tissue and delay onset\nof bony formations.\nPrognosis\nUsually, heel spurs are curable with conservative\ntreatment. If not, heel spurs are curable with surgery.About 10% of those that continue to see a physician forplantar fascitis have it for more than a year. If there is lim-ited success after approximately one year of conservativetreatment, patients are often advised to have surgery.\nPrevention\nTo prevent this condition, wearing shoes with proper\narches and support is very important. Proper stretching isalways a necessity, especially when there is an increase inactivities or a change in running technique. It is not rec-ommended to attempt working through the pain, as thiscan change a mild case of heel spurs and plantar fascitisinto a long lasting and painful episode of this condition.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPerkins, Kenneth E. “Lower Extremity Orthotics in Geriatric\nRehabilitation.” In Geriatric Physical Therapy .

    "title": "Heimlich maneuver",
    "content": "Heimlich maneuver\nDefinition\nThe Heimlich maneuver is an emergency procedure\nfor removing a foreign object lodged in the airway that ispreventing a person from breathing.\nPurpose\nEvery year about 3,000 adults die because they acci-\ndentally inhale rather than swallow food. The food getsstuck and blocks their trachea, making breathing impossi-ble. Death follows rapidly unless the food or other foreign\nmaterial can be displaced from the airway. This conditionis so common it has been nicknamed the “cafe coronary.”\nIn 1974 Dr. Henry Heimlich first described an emer-\ngency technique for expelling foreign material blockingthe trachea. This technique, now called the Heimlichmaneuver or abdominal thrusts, is simple enough that itcan be performed immediately by anyone trained in themaneuver. The Heimlich maneuver is a standard part ofall first aid courses.\nThe theory behind the Heimlich maneuver is that by\ncompressing the abdomen below the level of thediaphragm, air is forced under pressure out of the lungsdislodging the obstruction in the trachea and bringing theforeign material back up into the mouth.\nThe Heimlich maneuver is used mainly when solid\nmaterial like food, coins, vomit, or small toys are block-ing the airway. There has been some controversy aboutwhether the Heimlich maneuver is appropriate to useroutinely on near-drowning victims. After several stud-\nies of the effectiveness of the Heimlich maneuver onreestablishing breathing in near-drowning victims, theAmerican Red Cross and the American Heart Associa-tion both recommend that the Heimlich maneuver beused only as a last resort after traditional airway clear-ance techniques and cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR ) have been tried repeatedly and failed or if it is\nclear that a solid foreign object is blocking the airway.\nPrecautions\nIncorrect application of the Heimlich maneuver can\ndamage the chest, ribs, and internal organs of the personon whom it is performed. People may also vomit afterbeing treated with the Heimlich maneuver.\nDescription\nThe Heimlich maneuver can be performed on all\npeople. Modifications are necessary if the choking vic-\ntim is very obese, pregnant, a child, or an infant.\nIndications that a person’s airway is blocked\ninclude:\n• The person can not speak or cry out.\n• The person’s face turns blue from lack of oxygen.\n• The person desperately grabs at his or her throat.• The person has a weak cough , and labored breathing\nproduces a high-pitched noise.\n• The person does all of the above, then becomes uncon-\nscious.\nPerforming the Heimlich maneuver on adults\nTo perform the Heimlich maneuver on a conscious\nadult, the rescuer stands behind the victim. The victimmay either be sitting or standing. The rescuer makes afist with one hand, and places it, thumb toward the vic-tim, below the rib cage and above the waist. The rescuerencircles the victim’s waist, placing his other hand on topof the fist.\nIn a series of 6–10 sharp and distinct thrusts upward\nand inward, the rescuer attempts to develop enough pres-sure to force the foreign object back up the trachea. If themaneuver fails, it is repeated. It is important not to giveup if the first attempt fails. As the victim is deprived ofoxygen, the muscles of the trachea relax slightly.Because of this loosening, it is possible that the foreignobject may be expelled on a second or third attempt.\nIf the victim is unconscious, the rescuer should lay\nhim or her on the floor, bend the chin forward, make surethe tongue is not blocking the airway, and feel in themouth for foreign objects , being careful not to push any\nfarther into the airway. The rescuer kneels astride the vic-tim’s thighs and places his fists between the bottom ofthe victim’s breastbone and the navel. The rescuer thenexecutes a series of 6–10 sharp compressions by pushinginward and upward.\nAfter the abdominal thrusts, the rescuer repeats the\nprocess of lifting the chin, moving the tongue, feeling forand possibly removing the foreign material. If the airwayis not clear, the rescuer repeats the abdominal thrusts asoften as necessary. If the foreign object has beenremoved, but the victim is not breathing, the rescuerstarts CPR.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1564Heimlich maneuverPerforming the Heimlich maneuver under special\ncircumstances\nOBVIOUSLY PREGNANT AND VERY OBESE PEOPLE.\nThe main difference in performing the Heimlich maneu-ver on this group of people is in the placement of thefists. Instead of using abdominal thrusts, chest thrusts areused. The fists are placed against the middle of thebreastbone, and the motion of the chest thrust is in anddownward, rather than upward. If the victim is uncon-scious, the chest thrusts are similar to those used in CPR.\nCHILDREN. The technique in children over one year\nof age is the same as in adults, except that the amount offorce used is less than that used with adults in order toavoid damaging the child’s ribs, breastbone, and internalorgans.\nINFANTS UNDER ONE YEAR OLD. The rescuer sits\ndown and lays the infant along his or her forearm withthe infant’s face pointed toward the floor. The rescuer’shand supports the infant’s head, and his or her forearmrests on his or her own thigh for additional support.Using the heel of the other hand, the rescuer administersfour or five rapid blows to the infant’s back between theshoulder blades.\nAfter administering the back blows, the rescuer\nsandwiches the infant between his or her arms, and turnsthe infant over so that the infant is lying face up support-ed by the opposite arm. Using the free hand, the rescuerplaces the index and middle finger on the center of thebreastbone and makes four sharp chest thrusts. Thisseries of back blows and chest thrusts is alternated untilthe foreign object is expelled.\nSELF-ADMINISTRATION OF THE HEIMLICH MANEU-\nVER. To apply the Heimlich maneuver to oneself, one\nshould make a fist with one hand and place it in the mid-dle of the body at a spot above the navel and below thebreastbone, then grasp the fist with the other hand andpush sharply inward and upward. If this fails, the victimshould press the upper abdomen over the back of a chair,edge of a table, porch railing or something similar, andthrust up and inward until the object is dislodged.\nPreparation\nAny lay person can be trained to perform the Heim-\nlich maneuver. Knowing how may save someone’s life.Before doing the maneuver, it is important to determineif the airway is completely blocked. If the person chok-ing can talk or cry, Heimlich maneuver is not appropri-ate. If the airway is not completely blocked, the chokingvictim should be allowed to try to cough up the foreignobject on his or her own.Aftercare\nMany people vomit after being treated with the\nHeimlich maneuver. Depending on the length and severi-ty of the choking episode, the choking victim may needto be taken to a hospital emergency room.\nRisks\nIncorrectly applied, the Heimlich maneuver can\nbreak bones or damage internal organs. In infants, therescuer should never attempt to sweep the baby’s mouthwithout looking to remove foreign material. This is likelyto push the material farther down the trachea.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1565Heimlich maneuver\nThe Heimlich maneuverA quick \nupward thrustwith fistObject \ndislodged\nTo perform the Heimlich maneuver on a conscious adult (as\nillustrated above), the rescuer stands behind the victim andencircles his waist.The rescuer makes a fist with one handand places the other hand on top, positioned below the ribcage and above the waist.The rescuer then applies pres-sure by a series of upward and inward thrusts to force theforeign object back up the victim’s trachea.

    "title": "Heliobacteriosis",
    "content": "Heliobacteriosis\nDefinition\nHelicobacteriosis refers to infection of the gastroin-\ntestinal tract with the bacteria, Helicobacter pylori (H.\npylori ). While there are other rarer strains of Helicobac-\nterspecies that can infect humans, only H. pylori has\nbeen convincingly shown to be a cause of disease inhumans. The organism was first documented to causeinjury to the stomach in 1983, by two researchers in Aus-KEY TERMS\nDiaphragm —The thin layer of muscle that sepa-\nrates the chest cavity containing the lungs andheart from the abdominal cavity containing theintestines and digestive organs.\nTrachea —The windpipe. A tube extending from\nbelow the voice box into the chest where it splitsinto two branches, the bronchi, that lead to eachlung.tralia, who ingested the organism to prove their theory.\nSince then, H. pylori has been shown to be the main\ncause of ulcer disease, and has revolutionized the treat-ment of peptic ulcer disease. It is also believed to belinked to various cancers of the stomach.\nDescription\nH. pylori is a gram-negative, spiral-shaped organ-\nism, that contains flagella (tail-like structures) and otherproperties. In addition to flagella, which help the organ-ism to move around in the liquid mucous layer of thestomach, H. pylori also produces an enzyme called ure-\nase, that protects it from gastric acid present in the stom-ach. As the production of this enzyme is relatively unusu-al, new diagnostic tests have enabled rapid identificationof the bacteria.\nH. pylori also produces two other chemicals: a cyto-\ntoxin called vacA, and a protein known as cagA. Patientswith ulcer disease are more likely to produce the cytotox-in (vacA). The cagA protein not only occurs frequentlyin ulcer disease but also in cancer . It is still not known\nhow these substances enable H. pylori to cause disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nInfection with H. pylori is largely dependent on two\nfactors; age and income status. The bacteria is acquiredmainly in childhood, especially in areas of poor hygieneor overcrowding. H. pylori is two to three times more\nprevalent in developing, non-industrialized countries. Inthe United States for example, the organism is believedto be present in about one third of the population.\nThe exact way in which H. pylori gets passed from\none individual to another is uncertain, but person to per-son transmission is most likely. In most cases, childrenare felt to be the source of spread. Reinfection of thosewho have been cured has been documented, especially inareas of overcrowding.\nThe bacteria is well adapted to survival within the\nstomach. Not only does it survive there for years, butonce infection begins, a form of chronic inflammation(chronic gastritis ) always develops. In most individu-\nals, initial infection causes little or no symptoms; how-ever, some individuals such as the original researcherswho ingested the bacteria, wind up with abdominalpain and nausea.\nIn about 15% of infected persons, ulcer disease\ndevelops either in the stomach or duodenum. Why somedevelop ulcer disease and others do not, remains unclear.Ulcer symptoms are characterized by upper abdominalpain that is typically of a burning or “gnawing” type, andusually is rapidly relieved by antacids or food.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1566HeliobacteriosisAcid secretion increases in most patients with duode-\nnal ulcers. This increase returns to normal once H. pylori is\neliminated. It is now known that elimination of the bacteriawill substantially decrease the risk of recurrent bouts ofulcer disease in the vast majority (85% or so) of patients.\nIn the last decade it has been shown that H. pylori is\nnot only the prime cause of ulcer disease of the stomachand duodenum, but is also strongly associated with varioustumors of the stomach. Bacterial infection is nine timesmore common in patients with cancer of the stomach, andseven times more common in those with lymphoma of thestomach (tumor of the lymphatic tissue), called a MALTtumor. It is believed that the prolonged inflammation leadsto changes in cell growth and tumors. Eliminating H.\npylori can lead to regression of some tumors.\nIn addition to the above damage caused by H. pylori ,\nsome individuals lose normal gastric function, such asthe ability to absorb vitamin B\n12.\nDiagnosis\nThere are basically two types of tests to identify\ninfection: one group is “invasive” in that it involves theuse of an endoscopy to obtain biopsy specimens for eval-uation, while the other “noninvasive” methods depend onblood or breath samples. Invasive tests can be less accu-rate because of technical limitations: the biopsy maymiss the area where the bacteria hides.\nInvasive studies make use of tissue obtained by endo-\nscopic biopsy to identify the organism. The bacteria can besearched for in pieces of biopsy tissue or grown (cultured)from the specimen. However, H. pylori is not easy to cul-\nture. Another method uses the bacteria’s production of theenzyme urease. Biopsy specimens are placed on a card thatchanges color if urease is present. Results are often avail-able within a few minutes, but can take up to 24 hours.\nNoninvasive tests are of two types: blood tests and\nbreath test. Blood tests measure antibodies to make adiagnosis accurately within minutes. This can be doneimmediately in the doctor’s office. In addition, antibodylevels can be measured several months after treatment, tosee if H. pylori has been eradicated.\nThe breath test uses radioactive or non-radioactive\nforms of a compound called urea, which the patient drinks.The method that uses a radioactive form urea is easier toperform, as the equipment is commonly available in x-raydepartments. Radiation exposure is less than that of achest x ray . The test that uses non-radioactive urea is safer\nfor children. The breath test is the best way to be sure ofelimination of H. pylori . The test can be used within 30\ndays after treatment. This is an advantage over followingantibody levels that take six months or longer to diminish.Treatment\nH. pylori peptic ulcers are treated with drugs to kill\nthe bacteria, drugs to reduce stomach acid, and drugs toprotect the lining of the stomach. The antibiotics most\ncommonly used to kill the bacteria are: amoxicillin, clar-ithromycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline. Drugs usedto reduce stomach acid may be histamine blockers orproton pump inhibitors. The most commonly used hista-mine blockers are: cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine,and ranitidine. The most commonly used proton pumpinhibitors are: lansoprazole and omeprazole. The drugbismuth subsalicylate (a component of Pepto-Bismol) isused to protect the stomach lining.\nThe most common drug treatment is a two-week\ncourse of treatment called triple therapy. This treatmentregimen involves taking two antibiotics to kill the bacte-ria and either an acid reducer or a stomach-lining shield.This therapy has been shown to kill the bacteria, reduceulcer symptoms, and prevent ulcer recurrence in over90% of patients.\nThe main drawback of triple therapy is that some\npatients find it difficult to follow because it oftenrequires taking as many as 20 pills a day. The antibioticsmay also cause unpleasant side effects that may makecertain patients less likely to follow the treatment proto-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1567Heliobacteriosis\nA light microscopic image of a stomach ulcer.

These side effects include: dark stools, diarrhea ,\ndizziness ,headache , a metallic taste in the mouth, nau-\nsea, vomiting, and yeast infections in women.\nPrognosis\nThe elimination of H. pylori and cure of ulcer dis-\nease is now possible in more than 90% of those infected.The finding that most ulcers are due to an infectiousagent has brought a dramatic change in treatment andoutlook for those suffering from that disease.

    "content": "Hellerwork\nDefinition\nHellerwork is a system of bodywork that combines\ndeep tissue massage, body movement education, and ver-bal dialogue. It is designed to realign the body’s structurefor overall health, improvement of posture, and reductionof physical and mental stress .\nPurpose\nHellerwork improves posture and brings the body’s\nnatural structure into proper balance and alignment. This\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1568Hellerworkrealignment can bring relief from general aches and\npains; improve breathing; and relieve physical and men-tal stress. Hellerwork has also been used to treat suchspecific physical problems as chronic back, neck, shoul-der, and joint pain as well as repetitive stress injuries,\nincluding carpal tunnel syndrome . Hellerwork is also\nused to treat and prevent athletic injuries.\nDescription\nOrigins\nJoseph Heller (1940–) developed Hellerwork, a sys-\ntem of structural integration patterned after Rolfing .\nAlthough Heller received a degree in engineering andworked for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasade-na, CA, he became interested in humanistic psychologyin the 1970s. He spent two years studying bioenergeticsand Gestalt therapy as well as studying under architect\nand futurist Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983), flotationtank therapy developer John Lilly, family therapist Vir-ginia Satir, and body movement pioneer Judith Aston.\nDuring this period, he trained for six years with Dr.\nIda P. Rolf (1896-1979), the founder of Rolfing, andbecame a certified Rolfer in 1972. After Heller devel-oped his own system of bodywork, he founded Heller-work in 1979 and established a training facility in Mt.\nShasta, California, where he continues his work.\nHellerwork is based largely on the principles of\nRolfing, in which the body’s connective tissue is manipu-lated or massaged to realign and balance the body’sstructure. Because Heller believes that physical realign-ment is insufficient, however, he expanded his system toinclude movement education and verbal dialogue as wellas deep tissue massage.\nConnective tissue massage\nThe massage therapy aspect of Hellerwork is\ndesigned to release the tension that exists in the deep con-nective tissue, called fascia, and return it to a normal align-ment. The fascia is plastic and highly adaptable; it cantighten and harden in response to the general effects ofgravity on the body, other ongoing physical stresses, nega-tive attitudes and emotions, and periodic physical traumas.One example of ongoing physical stress is carrying abriefcase, which pulls down the shoulder on one side ofthe body. Over time, the connective tissue becomes hardand stiff; the body becomes adapted to that position evenwhen the person is not carrying a briefcase. In trying toadjust to the uneven weight distribution, the rest of thebody becomes unbalanced and out of proper alignment.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1569Hellerwork\nJOSEPH HELLER (1940– )\nBorn in Poland, Joseph Heller attended school in\nEurope until age 16, when he immigrated to the UnitedStates. Living in Los Angeles, he attended the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology in Pasadena and graduated in1962 with a degree in engineering. He worked for 10years at the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-tion’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena as anaerospace engineer. During his service at JPL, Hellerbecame interested in humanistic psychology. After leav-ing JPL in 1972, he became director of Kairos, a center forhuman development in Los Angeles. He spent two yearsstudying bioenergetics and gestalt. He also trained underBuckminster Fuller, flotation tank therapy developer JohnLilly, self esteem trainer Virginia Satir, and body move-ment pioneer Judith Aston.\nHe became a certified Rolfer in 1972 and spent the\nnext six years studying structural integration under Rolf-ing founder Ida P. Rolf. He became the first president ofthe Rolf Institute in 1975. During his training with Rolf,Heller began developing his own system of bodywork.He left the institute in 1978 and moved to Northern Cali-fornia where he founded Hellerwork. He conducts class-es and continues his work today at his headquarters, 406Berry St., Mt. Shasta, CA 96067.\n(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)Heller believes that as people age, more of these stress\nand trauma patterns become ingrained in the connective tis-sue, further throwing the body out of alignment. As stressaccumulates, the body shortens and stiffens, a process com-monly attributed to aging . Hellerwork seeks to recondition\nthe body and make the connective tissue less rigid.\nMovement education\nThe second component of Hellerwork, movement\neducation, trains patients in the proper physical move-ments needed to keep the body balanced and correctlyaligned. Movement education focuses on commonactions, such as sitting, standing, and walking. Heller-work practitioners also teach better patterns of move-ment for activities that are specific to each individual,such as their job and favorite sports or social activities.\nV erbal dialogue\nVerbal dialogue is the third aspect of Hellerwork. It\nis designed to teach awareness of the relationshipsKEY TERMS\nBioenergetics —A system of therapy that combines\nbreathing and body exercises, psychological ther-apy, and the free expression of emotions to releaseblocked physical and psychic energy.\nBodywork —A term that covers a variety of thera-\npies that include massage, realignment of thebody, and similar techniques to treat deeplyingrained stresses and traumas carried in the tis-sues of the body.\nChronic —A disease or condition that progresses\nslowly but persists or reoccurs over time.\nFascia —The sheet of connective tissue that covers\nthe body under the skin and envelops the musclesand various organs.\nGestalt therapy —A form of therapy that focuses\non helping patients reconnect with their bodiesand their feelings directly, as contrasted with ver-bal intellectual analysis.\nKinesiology —The study of the anatomy and physi-\nology of body movement, particularly in relationto therapy.\nRolfing —A deep-tissue therapy that involves\nmanipulating the body’s fascia to realign and bal-ance the body’s structure.among emotions, life attitudes, and the body. Hellerwork\npractitioners believe that as patients become responsiblefor their attitudes, their body movements and patterns ofself-expression improve. Dialogue focuses on the themeof each session and the area of the body that is worked onduring that session.\nHellerwork consists of eleven 90-minute sessions\ncosting about $90–100 each. The first three sessionsfocus on the surface layers of the fascia and on develop-mental issues of infancy and childhood. The next foursessions are the core sessions and work on the deep lay-ers and on adolescent developmental issues. The finalfour treatments are the integrative sessions, and buildupon all the previous ones, while also looking at ques-tions of maturity.\nPreparations\nNo advance preparations are required to begin Heller-\nwork treatment. The treatment is usually done on a mas-sage table with the patient wearing only undergarments.\nPrecautions\nSince Hellerwork involves vigorous deep tissue\nmassage, it is often described as uncomfortable andsometimes painful, especially during the first several ses-sions. As it requires the use of hands, it may be a prob-lem for people who do not like or are afraid of beingtouched. It is not recommended as a treatment for anydisease or a chronic inflammatory condition such asarthritis, and can worsen such a condition. Anyone with aserious medical condition, including heart disease, dia-betes, or respiratory problems, should consult a medicalpractitioner before undergoing Hellerwork.\nSide effects\nThere are no reported serious side effects associated\nwith Hellerwork when delivered by a certified practition-er to adults and juveniles.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAs most alternative or holistic treatments, there is\nlittle mainstream scientific research documenting theeffectiveness of Hellerwork therapy. Since the deep tis-sue massage aspect of Hellerwork is similar to Rolfing,however, several scientific studies of Rolfing may beuseful in evaluating Hellerwork. A 1988 study publishedin the Journal of the American Physical Therapy Associ-\nation indicated that Rolfing stimulates the parasympa-\nthetic nervous system, which can help speed the recoveryof damaged tissue. A 1997 article in The Journal of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1570HellerworkOrthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy reported that\nRolfing can provide effective and sustained pain relieffrom lower back problems.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBradford, Nikki, ed.

    "content": "Hematocrit\nDefinition\nThe hematocrit measures how much space in the\nblood is occupied by red blood cells. It is useful whenevaluating a person for anemia.\nPurpose\nBlood is made up of red and white blood cells, and\nplasma. A decrease in the number or size of red cells alsodecreases the amount of space they occupy, resulting in alower hematocrit. An increase in the number or size ofred cells increases the amount of space they occupy,resulting in a higher hematocrit. Thalassemia is a condi-\ntion which can cause an increased number of red bloodcells but a decreased size and hematocrit.\nThe hematocrit is usually done on a person with\nsymptoms of anemia. An anemic person has fewer orsmaller than normal red cells. A low hematocrit, combinedwith other abnormal blood tests, confirms the diagnosis.KEY TERMS\nAnemia —A condition where a person has fewer\nor smaller than normal red blood cells.\nHemoglobin —The percentage of space in blood\noccupied by red blood cells.\nSome conditions, such as polycythemia, cause an\noverproduction of red blood cells, resulting in anincreased hematocrit.\nTransfusion decisions are based on the results of\nlaboratory tests, including hematocrit. Transfusion is notconsidered if the hematocrit level is reasonable. The leveldiffers for each person, depending on his or her clinicalcondition.\nDescription\nBlood drawn from a fingerstick is often used for\nhematocrit testing. The blood fills a small tube, which isthen spun in a small centrifuge. As the tube spins, the redblood cells go to the bottom of the tube, the white bloodcells cover the red in a thin layer called the buffy coat,and the liquid plasma rises to the top. The spun tube isexamined for the line that divides the red cells from thebuffy coat and plasma. The height of the red cell columnis measured as a percent of the total blood column. Thehigher the column of red cells, the higher the hematocrit.\nThe hematocrit test can also be done on an automat-\ned instrument as part of a complete blood count . It is\nalso called Packed Red Cell V olume or Packed Cell V ol-ume, or abbreviated as Hct or Crit. The test is covered byinsurance when medically necessary. Results are usuallyavailable the same or following day.\nPreparation\nTo collect the blood by fingerstick, a healthcare\nworker punctures a finger with a lancet and allows theblood to fill a small tube held to the puncture site.\nTests done on an automated instrument require 5–7\nmL of blood. A healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on theperson’s upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbowregion, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum actiondraws the blood through the needle into an attached tube.Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.\nAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1571Hematocritpuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.\nWarm packs to the puncture site relieve discomfort.\nNormal results\nNormal values vary with age and sex. Adult male\nrange is 42–52%, adult female 36–48%.\nAbnormal results\nHematocrit values decrease when the size or number\nof red cells decrease. This is most common in anemia, butother conditions have similar effects: excessive bleeding,damaged cells due to a mechanical heart valve, liver dis-ease, and cancers affecting the bone marrow.

    "title": "Hemochromatosis",
    "content": "Hemochromatosis\nDefinition\nHemochromatosis is an inherited blood disorder that\ncauses the body to retain excessive amounts of iron. Thisiron overload can lead to serious health consequences,most notably cirrhosis of the liver.\nDescription\nHemochromatosis is also known as iron overload,\nbronze diabetes, hereditary hemochromatosis and famil-ial hemochromatosis. The inherited disorder causesincreased absorption of intestinal iron, well beyond thatneeded to replace the body’s loss of iron. Iron overloaddiseases afflict as many as 1.5 million persons in theUnited States. The most common of these, as well as oneof the most common genetic disorders in the UnitedStates, is hereditary hemochromatosis. Men and womenare equally affected by hemochromatosis, but women arediagnosed later in life because of blood loss from men-struation and childbirth . It most commonly appears inpatients between the ages of 40-60 years, since it takes\nmany years for the body to accumulate excessive iron.Symptoms appear later in females than in males—usual-ly after menopause .\nHemochromatosis causes excess iron storage in sev-\neral organs of the body including the liver, pancreas,endocrine glands, heart, skin, joints, and intestinal lining.The buildup of iron in these organs can lead to seriouscomplications, including heart failure ,liver cancer , and\ncirrhosis of the liver. It is estimated that about 5% of cir-rhosis cases are caused by hereditary hemochromatosis.\nIdiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, a disorder\nafflicting children and young adults, is a similar overloaddisorder characterized by abnormal accumulation ofhemosiderin. Hemosiderin is a protein found in most tis-sues, especially the liver. It is produced by digestion ofhematin, an iron-related substance.\nHemochromatosis is one of the most common genet-\nic disorders in the United States. Approximately one innine individuals have one abnormal hemochromatosisgene (11% of the population). Since everyone has twocopies of each gene, these individuals have an abnormalHFE gene and a normal gene. They are called carriers.\nBetween 1/200-1/400 individuals have two abnormalgenes for hemochromatosis and no normal gene.\nWith most autosomal recessive conditions, an affect-\ned person’s parents are carriers. If more than one familymember has the condition, they are siblings. Hemochro-matosis is so common, however, that families are seen inwhich both parents are affected, or one parent is affectedand the other parent is a carrier. More than one genera-tion may be affected, which is not usually seen in rareautosomal recessive conditions.\nCauses and symptoms\nHereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal reces-\nsive condition. This means that individuals withhemochromatosis have inherited an altered (mutated)gene from both of their parents. Affected individualshave two abnormal hemochromatosis genes and no nor-mal hemochromatosis gene.\nThe gene that causes hemochromatosis has been\nidentified, and the most common abnormalities of thegene have been described. The gene is on chromosome 6;it is called HFE . Scientists have not confirmed the func-\ntion of the normal gene product; they do know that itinteracts with the cell receptor for transferrin. Transferrinbinds and transports iron in the blood.\nBecause it is an autosomal recessive condition, sib-\nlings of individuals who have hemochromatosis are at a25% risk to also be affected. However, the likelihood that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1572Hemochromatosisan individual will develop symptoms depends on which\ngene mutation he or she has as well as environmentalfactors. The two most common changes in the HFE gene\nare C282Y and H63D . The age at which symptoms begin\nis variable, even within the same family.\nThe symptoms of hemochromatosis include fatigue ,\nweight loss, weakness, shortness of breath , heart palpi-\ntations , chronic abdominal pain , and impaired sexual\nperformance. The patient may also show symptoms com-monly connected with heart failure, diabetes or cirrhosisof the liver. Changes in the pigment of the skin mayappear, such as grayness in certain areas, or a tanned oryellow ( jaundice ) appearance. The age of onset and ini-\ntial symptoms vary.\nIdiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis may first, and\nonly, appear as paleness of the skin. Sometimes, thepatient will experience spitting of blood from the lungsor bronchial tubes.\nDiagnosis\nThe most common diagnostic methods for hemo-\nchromatosis are blood studies of iron, genetic blood stud-ies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and liver\nbiopsy . Blood studies of transferrin–iron saturation and\nferritin concentration are often used to screen for ironoverload. Ferritin is a protein that transports iron andliver enzymes. Additional studies are performed to con-firm the diagnosis.\nBlood studies used to confirm the diagnosis include\nadditional iron studies and/or genetic blood studies.Genetic blood studies became available in the late 1990s.Genetic testing is a reliable method of diagnosis. How-\never, in the year 2001 scientists and physicians are study-ing how accurately having a hemochromatosis mutationpredicts whether a person will develop symptoms. Mostindividuals affected with hemochromatosis (87%) havetwo identifiable gene mutations i.e. genetic testing willconfirm the diagnosis in most individuals. Genetic stud-ies are also be used to determine whether the affectedperson’s family members are at risk for hemochromato-sis. The results of genetic testing are the same whether ornot a person has developed symptoms.\nMRI scans and/or liver biopsy may be necessary to\nconfirm the diagnosis. MRI studies of the liver (or otheriron absorbing organs), with quantitative assessment ofiron concentration, may reveal abnormal iron deposits.For the liver biopsy, a thin needle is inserted into the liverwhile the patient is under local anesthesia. The needlewill extract a small amount of liver tissue, which can beanalyzed microscopically to measure its iron content andother signs of hemochromatosis. Diagnosis of idiopathicKEY TERMS\nAutosomal —Relating to any chromosome besides\nthe X and Y sex chromosomes. Human cells con-tain 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sexchromosomes.\nCirrhosis —A chronic degenerative disease of the\nliver, in which normal cells are replaced by fibroustissue. Cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the laterdevelopment of liver cancer.\nDiabetes mellitus —The clinical name for com-\nmon diabetes. It is a chronic disease characterizedby inadequate production or use of insulin.\nPhlebotomy —The taking of blood from the body\nthrough an incision in the vein, usually in thetreatment of disease.\npulmonary hemosiderosis begins with blood tests and x-\nray studies of the chest.\nTreatment\nPatients who show signs of iron overload will often\nbe treated with phlebotomy . Phlebotomy is a procedure\nthat involves drawing blood from the patient, just likeblood donation. Its purpose as a treatment is to rid thebody of excess iron storage. Patients may need these pro-cedures one or two times a week for a year or more. Lessfrequent phlebotomy may be continued in subsequentyears to keep excess iron from accumulating. Patientswho cannot tolerate phlebotomy due to other medicalproblems can be treated with Desferal (desferrioxamine).Diet restrictions may also be prescribed to limit theamount of iron ingested. Complications from hemochro-matosis, such as cirrhosis or diabetes, may also requiretreatment. Treatment for idiopathic pulmonary hemo-siderosis is based on symptoms.\nDiet restrictions may help lower the amount of iron\nin the body, but do not prevent or treat hemochromatosis.Individuals who are affected or who know they have twoC282Y and/or H63D genes may reduce iron intake by\navoiding iron and mineral supplements, excess vitaminC, and uncooked seafood. If a patient is symptomatic,he/she may be advised to abstain from drinking alcohol.\nPrognosis\nWith early detection and treatment, the prognosis is\nusually good. All potential symptoms are prevented if ironlevels are kept within the normal range, which is possible if\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1573Hemochromatosisthe diagnosis is made before an individual is symptomatic.\nIf a patient is symptomatic but treated successfully beforehe/she develops liver cirrhosis, the patient’s life expectancyis near normal. However, if left untreated, complicationsmay arise which can be fatal. These include liver cancer ,\nliver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure,\nand difficulty depleting iron overload through phlebotomy.Liver biopsy can be helpful in determining prognosis ofmore severely affected individuals. Genetic testing may alsobe helpful, as variable severity has been noted in patientswho have two C282Y genes compared to patients with two\nH63D genes or one of each. Men are two times more likely\nthan women to develop severe complications. The progno-sis for patients with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis isfair, depending on detection and complications.\nPrevention\nScreening for hemochromatosis is cost effective, par-\nticularly for certain groups of people. Relatives of patientswith hemochromatosis—including children, siblings, andparents—should be tested by the most appropriate method.The best screening method may be iron and ferritin studiesor genetic testing. If the affected person’s diagnosis hasbeen confirmed by genetic testing, relatives may havegenetic testing to determine whether or not they have thegenetic changes present in the affected individual. Manymedical groups oppose genetic testing of children. Relativeswho are affected but do not have symptoms can reduce ironintake and/or begin phlebotomy prior to the onset of symp-toms, possibly preventing ever becoming symptomatic.\nIn the winter of 2000, population screening for heredi-\ntary hemochromatosis is being widely debated. Many doc-tors and scientists want population screening becausehemochromatosis is easily and cheaply treated, and quitecommon. Arguments against treatment include the range ofsymptoms seen (and not seen) with certain gene mutations,and the risk of discrimination in health and life insurance.Whether or not population screening becomes favored by amajority, the publicity is beneficial. Hemochromatisis is acommon, easily and effectively treated condition. However,diagnosis may be difficult because the presenting symp-toms are the same as those seen with many other medicalproblems. The screening debate has the positive effect ofincreasing awareness and suspicion of hemochromatisis.Increased knowledge leads to earlier diagnosis and treat-ment of symptomatic individuals, and increased testing oftheir asymptomatic at–risk relatives.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBarton, James C., and Corwin Q.

    "content": "Hemoglobin electrophoresis\nDefinition\nHemoglobin electrophoresis (also called Hgb elec-\ntrophoresis), is a test that measures the different types ofhemoglobin in the blood. The method used is called elec-trophoresis, a process that causes movement of particlesin an electric field, resulting in formation of “bands” thatseparate toward one end or the other in the field.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1574HemochromatosisPurpose\nHgb electrophoresis is performed when a disorder\nassociated with abnormal hemoglobin (hemoglobinopa-thy) is suspected. The test is used primarily to diagnosediseases involving these abnormal forms of hemoglobin,such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia .\nPrecautions\nBlood transfusions within the previous 12 weeks\nmay alter test results.\nDescription\nHemoglobin (Hgb) is comprised of many different\ntypes, the most common being A1,A2, F, S, and C.\nHgb A 1is the major component of hemoglobin in the\nnormal red blood cell. Hgb A2is a minor component of\nnormal hemoglobin, comprising approximately 2–3% ofthe total.\nHgb F is the major hemoglobin component in the\nfetus, but usually exists only in minimal quantities in thenormal adult. Levels of Hgb F greater than 2% in patientsover three years of age are considered abnormal.\nHgb S is an abnormal form of hemoglobin associat-\ned with the disease of sickle cell anemia, which occurspredominantly in African-Americans. A distinguishingcharacteristic of sickle cell disease is the crescent-\nshaped red blood cell. Because the survival rate of thistype of cell is limited, patients with sickle cell diseasealso have anemia.\nHgb C is another hemoglobin variant found in\nAfrican Americans. Red blood cells containing Hgb Chave a decreased life span and are more readilydestroyed than normal red blood cells, resulting in mildto severe hemolytic anemia .\nEach of the major hemoglobin types has an electri-\ncal charge of a different degree, so the most usefulmethod for separating and measuring normal and abnor-mal hemoglobins is electrophoresis. This processinvolves subjecting hemoglobin components from dis-solved red blood cells to an electric field. The compo-nents then move away from each other at different rates,and when separated form a series of distinctly pigmentedbands. The bands are then compared with those of a nor-mal sample. Each band can be further assessed as a per-centage of the total hemoglobin, thus indicating theseverity of any abnormality.\nPreparation\nThis test requires a blood sample. No special prepa-\nration is needed before the test.KEY TERMS\nHemoglobin C disease —A disease of abnormal\nhemoglobin, occurring in 2–3% of African-Ameri-cans.

    "content": "Hemoglobin test\nDefinition\nHemoglobin is a protein inside red blood cells that car-\nries oxygen throughout the body. A hemoglobin test revealshow much hemoglobin is in a person’s blood, helping todiagnose and monitor anemia and polycythemia vera .\nPurpose\nA hemoglobin test is done when a person is ill or\nduring a general physical examination . Good healthrequires an adequate amount of hemoglobin. The amount\nof oxygen in the body tissues depends on how muchhemoglobin is in the red cells. Without enough hemoglo-bin, the tissues lack oxygen and the heart and lungs mustwork harder to try to compensate.\nIf the test indicates a “less than” or “greater than”\nnormal amount of hemoglobin, the cause of the decreaseor increase must be discovered. A low hemoglobin usual-ly means the person has anemia. Anemia results fromconditions that decrease the number or size of red cells,such as excessive bleeding, a dietary deficiency, destruc-tion of cells because of a transfusion reaction or mechan-\nical heart valve, or an abnormally formed hemoglobin.\nA high hemoglobin may be caused by polycythemia\nvera, a disease in which too many red blood cells are made.\nHemoglobin levels also help determine if a person\nneeds a blood transfusion. Usually a person’s hemoglobinmust be below 8 gm/dl before a transfusion is considered.\nDescription\nHemoglobin is made of heme, an iron compound,\nand globin, a protein. The iron gives blood its red color.Hemoglobin tests make use of this red color. A chemicalis added to a sample of blood to make the red blood cellsburst. When they burst, the red cells release hemoglobininto the surrounding fluid, coloring it clear red. By mea-suring the color using an instrument called a spectropho-tometer, the amount of hemoglobin is determined.\nHemoglobin is often ordered as part of a complete\nblood count (CBC), a test that includes other blood cell\nmeasurements.\nSome people inherit hemoglobin with an abnormal\nstructure. These abnormal hemoglobins cause diseases,such as sickle cell or Hemoglobin C disease. Specialtests, using a process called hemoglobin electrophore-\nsis, identify abnormal hemoglobins.\nPreparation\nThis test requires 5 mL of blood.

Men have14.0–18.0 g/dL, while women have levels of 12.0–16.0 g/dL.\nAbnormal results\nA low hemoglobin usually indicates the person has\nanemia. Further tests are done to discover the cause andtype of anemia. Dangerously low hemoglobin levels puta person at risk of a heart attack , congestive heart fail-\nure, or stroke .\nA high hemoglobin indicates the body is making too\nmany red cells. Further tests are done to see if this iscaused by polycythemia vera, or as a reaction to illness,high altitudes, heart failure, or lung disease.\nFluid volume in the blood affects hemoglobin val-\nues.

    "content": "Hemoglobinopathies\nDefinition\nHemoglobinopathies are genetic (inherited) disor-\nders of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein of thered blood cells.KEY TERMS\nAnemia —A condition characterized by a decrease\nin the size or number of red blood cells.\nHemoglobin —A protein inside red blood cells\nthat carries oxygen to body tissues.\nPolycythemia vera —A disease in which the bone\nmarrow makes too many red blood cells.Description\nThe hemoglobin molecule is composed of four sepa-\nrate polypeptide chains of amino acids, two alpha chainsand two beta chains, as well as four iron-bearing hemegroups that bind oxygen. The alpha chains are coded for bytwo similar genes on chromosome 16; the beta chains by asingle gene on chromosome 11. Mutations and deletions inthese genes cause one of the many hemoglobinopathies.\nIn general, hemoglobinopathies are divided into\nthose in which the gene abnormality results in a qualita-tive change in the hemoglobin molecule and those inwhich the change is quantitative. Sickle cell anemia(sickle cell disease ) is the prime example of the former,\nand the group of disorders known as the thalassemiasconstitute the latter. It has been estimated that one thirdof a million people worldwide are seriously affected byone of these genetic disorders.\nCauses and symptoms\nSickle cell anemia (SSA), an autosomal recessive\ndisorder more common in the Black population, iscaused by a single mutation in the gene that codes for thebeta polypeptide. Approximately 1/400 to 1/600 African-Americans are born with the disorder, and, one in ten is acarrier of one copy of the mutation. In certain parts of theAfrican continent, the prevalence of the disease reachesone in fifty individuals.\nThe sickle cell mutation results in the substitution of\nthe amnio acid, valine, for glutamic acid in the sixthposition of the beta polypeptide. In turn, this alters theconformation of the hemoglobin molecule and causes thered blood cells to assume a characteristic sickle shapeunder certain conditions. These sickle-shaped cells, nolonger able to pass smoothly through small capillaries,can block the flow of blood. This obstruction results insymptoms including growth retardation, severe pain\ncrises, tissue and organ damage, splenomegaly, andstrokes. Individuals with SSA are anemic and prone toinfections, particularly pneumonia , a significant cause\nof death in this group. Some or all of these symptoms\nare found in individuals who have the sickle mutation inboth copies of their beta-globin gene. Persons with oneabnormal gene and one normal gene are said to be carri-ers of the sickle cell trait. Carriers are unaffected becauseof the remaining normal copy of the gene.\nThe thalassemias are a diverse group of disorders\ncharacterized by the fact that the causative mutationsresult in a decrease in the amount of normal hemoglobin.Thalassemias are common in Mediterranean populationsas well as in Africa, India, the Mideast, and SoutheastAsia. The two main types of thalassemias are alpha-tha-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1577Hemoglobinopathieslassemia due to mutations in the alpha polypeptide and\nbeta-thalassemia resulting from beta chain mutations.\nSince individuals possess a total of four genes for\nthe alpha polypeptide (two genes on each of their twochromosomes 16), disease severity depends on howmany of the four genes are abnormal. A defect in one ortwo of the genes has no clinical effect. Abnormalities ofthree results in a mild to moderately severe anemia(hemoglobin H disease) and splenomegaly. Loss of func-tion of all four genes usually causes such severe oxygendeprivation that the affected fetus does not survive. Amassive accumulation of fluid in the fetus (hydrops fetal-is) results in stillbirth or neonatal death.\nBeta thalassemias can range from mild and clinical-\nly insignificant (beta thalassemia minor) to severe and\nlife-threatening (beta thalassemia major, also known asCooley’s anemia), depending on the exact nature of thegene mutation and whether one or both copies of the betagene are affected. While the milder forms may onlycause slight anemia, the more severe types result ingrowth retardation, skeletal changes, splenomegaly, vul-nerability to infections, and death as early as the firstdecade of life.\nDiagnosis\nMany countries, including the United States, have\nmade concerted efforts to screen for sickle cell anemia atbirth because of the potential for beginning early treat-ment and counseling parents about their carrier status.Diagnosis is traditionally made by blood tests includinghemoglobin electrophoresis . Similar tests are used to\ndetermine whether an individual is a sickle cell or tha-lassemia carrier. In certain populations with a high preva-lence of one of the mutations, carrier testing is common.If both members of a couple are carriers of one of theseconditions, it is possible through prenatal genetic testingKEY TERMS\nAutosomal recessive —A pattern of inheritance in\nwhich both copies of an autosomal gene must beabnormal for a genetic condition or disease tooccur.

Theuse of prophylactic (preventative) antibiotic therapyhas been particularly successful. Other treatmentsinclude fluid therapy to prevent dehydration , oxygen\nsupplementation, pain relievers, blood transfusions,and several different types of medications. Recentinterest has focused on bone marrow transplantation\nand future directions include the possibility of genereplacement therapy.\nSince the clinically important thalassemias are char-\nacterized by severe anemia, the traditional treatment hasbeen blood transfusion , but the multiple transfusions\nneeded to sustain life lead to an iron overload throughoutthe tissues of the body and eventual destruction of theheart and other organs. For this reason, transfusion thera-py must also include infusions of medications such asdeferoxamine (desferroxamine) to rid the body of excessiron. As with sickle cell anemia, bone marrow therapyhas been successful in some cases.\nPrognosis\nHemoglobinopathies are life-long disorders. The\nprognosis depends upon the exact nature of the mutation,the availability of effective treatment, as well as the indi-vidual’s compliance with therapies.\nPrevention\nBecause the hemoglobinopathies are inherited dis-\neases, primary prevention involves carriers makingreproductive decisions to prevent passage of the abnor-mal gene to their offspring. At present, most preventionis targeted toward the symptoms using treatments such asthose described above.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBehrman, Richard E. et al. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. 16th\ned.

    "content": "Hemolytic anemia\nDefinition\nRed blood cells have a normal life span of approxi-\nmately 90–120 days, at which time the old cells aredestroyed and replaced by the body’s natural processes.Hemolytic anemia is a disorder in which the red bloodcells are destroyed prematurely. The cells are broken downat a faster rate than the bone marrow can produce newcells. Hemoglobin, the component of red blood cells thatcarries oxygen, is released when these cells are destroyed.\nDescription\nAs a group, anemias (conditions in which the num-\nber of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin inthem is below normal) are the most common blood disor-ders. Hemolytic anemias, which result from theincreased destruction of red blood cells, are less commonthan anemias caused by excessive blood loss or bydecreased hemoglobin or red cell production.\nSince a number of factors can increase red blood cell\ndestruction, hemolytic anemias are generally identifiedby the disorder that brings about the premature destruc-tion. Those disorders are classified as either inherited oracquired. Inherited hemolytic anemias are caused byinborn defects in components of the red blood cells—thecell membrane, the enzymes, or the hemoglobin.Acquired hemolytic anemias are those that result fromvarious other causes. With this type, red cells are pro-duced normally, but are prematurely destroyed becauseof damage that occurs to them in the circulation.\nCauses and symptoms\nInherited hemolytic anemias involve conditions that\ninterfere with normal red blood cell production. Disor-ders that affect the red blood cell membrane includehereditary spherocytosis, in which the normally disk-shaped red cells become spherical, and hereditary ellip-tocytosis, in which the cells are oval, rather than disk-shaped. Other hereditary conditions that cause hemolyticanemia include disorders of the hemoglobin, such assickle cell anemia and thalassemia , and red blood cell\nenzyme deficiencies, such as G6PD deficiency.\nThe causes of acquired hemolytic anemias vary, but\nthe most common are responses to certain medicationsand infections. Medications may cause the body to devel-op antibodies that bind to the red blood cells and causetheir destruction in the spleen. Immune hemolytic anemiamost commonly involves antibodies that react against thered blood cells at body temperature (warm—antibodyhemolytic anemia), which can cause premature destruc-tion of the cells. About 20% of hemolytic anemias causedby warm antibodies come from diseases such as lympho-cytic leukemia, 10% from an autoimmune disease, andothers are drug-induced. Cold-antibody hemolytic anemiais a condition in which the antibodies react with the redblood cells at a temperature below that of normal bodytemperature. Red blood cells can also receive mechanicaldamage as they circulate through the blood vessels.Aneurysms, artificial heart valves, or very high bloodpressure can cause the red cells to break up and releasetheir contents. In addition, hemolytic anemia may becaused by a condition called hypersplenism , in which a\nlarge, overactive spleen rapidly destroys red blood cells.\nMajor symptoms of hemolytic anemias are similar\nto those for all anemias, including shortness of breath ;\nnoticeable increase in heart rate, especially with exertion;fatigue ; pale appearance; and dark urine. A yellow tint,\nor jaundice , may be seen in the skin or eyes of hemolytic\nanemia patients. Examination may also show an enlargedspleen. A more emergent symptom of hemolytic anemiais pain in the upper abdomen. Severe anemia is indicated\nif there are signs of heart failure or an enlarged liver.\nDiagnosis\nIn order to differentiate hemolytic anemia from oth-\ners, physicians will examine the blood for the number ofyoung red blood cells, since the number of young cells isincreased in hemolytic anemia. The physician will alsoexamine the abdominal area to check for spleen or liverenlargement. If the physician knows the duration ofhemolysis, it may also help differentiate between types ofanemia. There are a number of other indications that canbe obtained from blood samples that will help a physicianscreen for hemolytic anemia. An antiglobulin (Coomb’s)test may be performed as the initial screening exam afterdetermining hemolysis. In the case of immune hemolyticanemia, a direct Coomb’s test is almost always positive.\nTreatment\nTreatment will depend on the cause of the anemia, and\nmay involve treatment of the underlying cause.

    "content": "Teresa Norris, RNHemolytic-uremic syndrome\nDefinition\nHemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare condi-\ntion that affects mostly children under the age of 10, butalso may affect the elderly as well as persons with otherillnesses. HUS, which most commonly develops after asevere bowel infection with certain toxic strains of a bac-teria, is characterized by destruction of red blood cells,damage to the lining of blood vessel walls, and in severecases, kidney failure.\nDescription\nMost cases of HUS occur after an infection in the\ndigestive system that has been caused by toxin-produc-ing strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli . About\n75% of HUS cases in the United States are caused by thestrain referred to as E. coli O157:H7, which is found in\nthe intestinal tract of cattle,while the remaining casesare caused by non-O157 strains. Some children infectedwith E. coli O157:H7 will develop HUS. HUS also can\nfollow respiratory infection episodes in young children.In the United States, there are about 20,000 infectionsand 250 deaths annually that are caused by E. coli\nO157:H7. HUS has also been known to occur in personsusing drugs such as oral contraceptives , immunosup-\npressors, and antineoplastics, and in women during thepostpartum period.\nE. coli. O157:H7, first identified in 1982, and isolat-\ned with increasing frequency since then, is found in cont-aminated foods such as meat, dairy products, and juices.Infection with E. coli. O157:H7 causes severe gastroen-\nteritis , which can include abdominal pain , vomiting, and\nbloody diarrhea . For most children, the vomiting and\ndiarrhea stop within two to three days. However, about 5to 10% of the children will develop HUS and willbecome pale, tired, and irritable. Toxins produced by thebacteria enter the blood stream, where they destroy redblood cells and platelets, which contribute to the clottingof blood. The damaged red blood cells and platelets clogtiny blood vessels in the kidneys, or form lesions to occurin the kidneys, making it difficult for the kidneys toremove wastes and extra fluid from the body, resulting inhypertension , fluid accumulation, and reduced produc-\ntion of urine.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common way an E. coli O157:H7 infec-\ntion is contracted is through the consumption of under-cooked ground beef (e.g., eating hamburgers that are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1580Hemolytic anemiastill pink inside). Healthy cattle carry E. coli within their\nintestines. During the slaughtering process, the meat canbecome contaminated with the E. coli from the\nintestines. When contaminated beef is ground up, the E.\ncoliare spread throughout the meat. Additional ways to\ncontract an E. coli infection include drinking contami-\nnated water and unpasteurized milk and juices, eatingcontaminated fruits and vegetables, and working withcattle. The infection is also easily transmitted from aninfected person to others in settings such as day carecenters and nursing homes when improper sanitary prac-tices are used.\nSymptoms of an E. coli O157:H7 infection start about\nseven days after infection with the bacteria. The firstsymptom is sudden onset of severe abdominal cramps.After a few hours, watery diarrhea starts, causing loss offluids and electrolytes ( dehydration ), which causes the\nperson to feel tired and ill. The watery diarrhea lasts forabout a day, and then changes to bright red bloody stools,as the infection causes sores to form in the intestines. Thebloody diarrhea lasts for two to five days, with as many asten bowel movements a day. Additional symptoms mayinclude nausea and vomiting , without a fever , or with\nonly a mild fever. After about five to ten days, HUS candevelop, which is characterized by paleness, irritability,and fatigue , as well as reduced urine production.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of an E. coli infection is made through\na stool culture . The culture must be taken within the first\n48 hours after the start of the bloody diarrhea. If a positiveculture is obtained, the patient should be monitored for thedevelopment of HUS, with treatment initiated as required.\nChildren should not go to day care until they have had\ntwo negative stool cultures. Older people in nursing homesshould stay in bed until two stool cultures are negative.\nTreatment\nTreatment of HUS is supportive, with particular\nattention to management of fluids and electrolytes. Treat-ment generally is provided in a hospital setting. Bloodtransfusions may be required. In about 50% of the cases,short term replacement of kidney function is required inthe form of dialysis. Most patients will recover kidneyfunction and be able to discontinue dialysis.\nSome studies have shown that the use of antibiotics\nand antimotility agents during an E. coli infection may\nworsen the course of the infection and should be avoided.However, other studies have been less definitive. Physi-cians should stay informed so that clinical practicesmatches medical advances on this aspect of treatment.Alternative treatment\nPersons with HUS must be under the care of health\ncare professionals skilled in the treatment of HUS.\nPrognosis\nNinety percent of children with HUS who receive\ncareful supportive care survive the initial acute stages ofthe condition, with most having no long-term effects.However, between 10 and 30 percent of the survivorswill have kidney damage that will lead to kidney failureimmediately or within several years. These children withkidney failure require on-going dialysis to remove wastesand extra fluids from their bodies, or may require a kid-ney transplant.\nPrevention\nPrevention of HUS caused by ingestion of foods\ncontaminated with E. coli O157:H7 and other toxin-pro-\nducing bacteria is accomplished through practicinghygienic food preparation techniques, including ade-quate handwashing, cooking of meat thoroughly, defrost-ing meats safely, vigorous washing of fruits and vegeta-bles, and handling leftovers properly.

    "title": "Hemophilia",
    "content": "Hemophilia\nDefinition\nHemophilia is a genetic disorder—usually inherit-\ned—of the mechanism of blood clotting. Depending onthe degree of the disorder present in an individual, excessbleeding may occur only after specific, predictableevents (such as surgery, dental procedures, or injury), oroccur spontaneously, with no known initiating event.\nDescription\nThe normal mechanism for blood clotting is a\ncomplex series of events involving the interaction ofthe injured blood vessel, blood cells (called platelets),and over 20 different proteins which also circulate inthe blood.\nWhen a blood vessel is injured in a way that causes\nbleeding, platelets collect over the injured area, and forma temporary plug to prevent further bleeding. This tem-porary plug, however, is too disorganized to serve as along-term solution, so a series of chemical events occur,resulting in the formation of a more reliable plug. Thefinal plug involves tightly woven fibers of a materialcalled fibrin. The production of fibrin requires the inter-action of several chemicals, in particular a series of pro-teins called clotting factors. At least thirteen differentclotting factors have been identified.\nThe clotting cascade, as it is usually called, is the\nseries of events required to form the final fibrin clot. Thecascade uses a technique called amplification to rapidlyproduce the proper sized fibrin clot from the small num-ber of molecules initially activated by the injury.\nIn hemophilia, certain clotting factors are either\ndecreased in quantity, absent, or improperly formed.Because the clotting cascade uses amplification to rapid-ly plug up a bleeding area, absence or inactivity of justone clotting factor can greatly increase bleeding time .\nHemophilia A is the most common type of bleeding\ndisorder and involves decreased activity of factor VIII.There are three levels of factor VIII deficiency: severe,moderate, and mild. This classification is based on thepercentage of normal factor VIII activity present:\n• Individuals with less than 1% of normal factor VIII\nactivity level have severe hemophilia. Half of all peoplewith hemophilia A fall into this category. Such individ-uals frequently experience spontaneous bleeding, mostfrequently into their joints, skin, and muscles. Surgeryor trauma can result in life-threatening hemorrhage,and must be carefully managed.\n• Individuals with 1–5% of normal factor VIII activity\nlevel have moderate hemophilia, and are at risk forheavy bleeding after seemingly minor traumatic injury.\n• Individuals with 5–40% of normal factor VIII activity\nlevel have mild hemophilia, and must prepare carefullyfor any surgery or dental procedures.\nIndividuals with hemophilia B have symptoms very\nsimilar to those of hemophilia A, but the deficient factoris factor IX. This type of hemophilia is also known asChristmas disease.\nHemophilia C is very rare, and much more mild than\nhemophilia A or B; it involves factor XI.\nHemophilia A affects between one in 5,000 to one in\n10,000 males in most populations.\nOne recent study estimated the prevalence of hemo-\nphilia was 13.4 cases per 100,000 U.S. males (10.5 hemo-philia A and 2.9 hemophilia B). By race/ethnicity, the preva-lence was 13.2 cases/100,000 among white, 11.0 amongAfrican-American, and 11.5 among Hispanic males.\nCauses and symptoms\nHemophilia A and B are both caused by a genetic\ndefect present on the X chromosome. (Hemophilia C isinherited in a different fashion.) About 70% of all peoplewith hemophilia A or B inherited the disease. The other30% develop from a spontaneous genetic mutation.\nThe following concepts are important to understand-\ning the inheritance of these diseases. All humans havetwo chromosomes determining their gender: femaleshave XX, males have XY . Because the trait is carriedonly on the X chromosome, it is called “sex-linked.” Thechromosome’s flawed unit is referred to as the gene.\nBoth factors VIII and IX are produced by a genetic\ndefect of the X chromosome, so hemophilia A and B areboth sex-linked diseases. Because a female child always\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1582Hemophiliareceives two X chromosomes, she nearly always will\nreceive at least one normal X chromosome. Therefore,even if she receives one flawed X chromosome, she willstill be capable of producing a sufficient quantity of fac-tors VIII and IX to avoid the symptoms of hemophilia.Such a person who has one flawed chromosome, but\ndoes not actually suffer from the disease, is called a carri-er. She carries the flaw that causes hemophilia and canpass it on to her offspring. If, however, she has a son whoreceives her flawed X chromosome, he will be unable to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1583Hemophilia\nNo gene\nno symptoms\nNo gene\nno symptomsNo gene\nno symptomsNo gene\nno symptoms\nHemophiliac fatherInherited gene\nhas symptomsInherited gene\nno symptoms\nInherited gene\nno symptomsInherited gene\nno symptomsCarrier mother\nTransmission by a carrier mother\nTransmission by a hemophiliac fatherXY X XX\nXX X X XX Y XXY\nXXYX X\nX XXX XXX YX Y\nHemophilia A and B are both caused by a genetic defect present on the X chromosome. Approximately 70% of people with\nhemophilia A or B inherited the disease, while the remaining 30% have hemophilia due to a spontaneous genetic mutation.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)produce the right quantity of factors VIII or IX, and he\nwill suffer some degree of hemophilia. (Males inheritone X and one Y chromosome, and therefore have onlyone X chromosome.)\nIn rare cases, a hemophiliac father and a carrier\nmother can pass on the right combination of parentalchromosomes to result in a hemophiliac female child.This situation, however, is rare. The vast majority of peo-ple with either hemophilia A or B are male.\nAbout 30% of all people with hemophilia A or B are\nthe first member of their family to ever have the disease.These individuals have had the unfortunate occurrence ofa spontaneous mutation; meaning that in their earlydevelopment, some random genetic accident befell theirX chromosome, resulting in the defect causing hemo-philia A or B. Once such a spontaneous genetic mutationtakes place, offspring of the affected person can inheritthe newly-created, flawed chromosome.\nIn the case of severe hemophilia, the first bleeding\nevent usually occurs prior to eighteen months of age.In some babies, hemophilia is suspected immediately,when a routine circumcision (removal of the foreskin\nof the penis) results in unusually heavy bleeding. Tod-dlers are at particular risk, because they fall frequently,and may bleed into the soft tissue of their arms andlegs. These small bleeds result in bruising and notice-able lumps, but don’t usually need treatment. As achild becomes more active, bleeding may occur intothe muscles; a much more painful and debilitatingproblem. These muscle bleeds result in pain and pres-\nsure on the nerves in the area of the bleed. Damage tonerves can cause numbness and decreased ability touse the injured limb.\nSome of the most problematic and frequent bleeds\noccur into the joints, particularly into the knees andelbows. Repeated bleeding into joints can result in scar-ring within the joints and permanent deformities. Indi-viduals may develop arthritis in joints that have sufferedcontinued irritation from the presence of blood. Mouthinjuries can result in compression of the airway, and,therefore, can be life-threatening. A blow to the head,which might be totally insignificant in a normal individ-ual, can result in bleeding into the skull and brain.Because the skull has no room for expansion, the hemo-philiac individual is at risk for brain damage due toblood taking up space and exerting pressure on the deli-cate brain tissue.\nPeople with hemophilia are at very high risk of hem-\norrhage (severe, heavy, uncontrollable bleeding) frominjuries such as motor vehicle accidents and also fromsurgery.Some other rare clotting disorders such as Von\nWillebrand disease present similar symptoms but are\nnot usually called hemophilia.\nDiagnosis\nVarious tests are available to measure, under very\ncarefully controlled conditions, the length of time it takesto produce certain components of the final fibrin clot.Tests called assays can also determine the percentage offactors VIII and IX present compared to normal percent-ages. This information can help in demonstrating thetype of hemophilia present, as well as the severity.\nIndividuals with a family history of hemophilia may\nbenefit from genetic counseling before deciding to have a\nbaby. Families with a positive history of hemophilia canalso have tests done during a pregnancy to determine\nwhether the fetus is a hemophiliac. The test called chorion-ic villous sampling examines proteins for the defects thatlead to hemophilia. This test, which is associated with a 1%risk of miscarriage , can be performed at 10–14 weeks.\nThe test called amniocentesis examines the DNA of fetal\ncells shed into the amniotic fluid for genetic mutations.Amniocentesis, which is associated with a one in 200 riskof miscarriage, is performed at 15–18 weeks gestation.\nTreatment\nThe most important thing that individuals with\nhemophilia can do to prevent complications of this dis-ease is to avoid injury. Those individuals who requiredental work or any surgery may need to be pre-treatedwith an infusion of factor VIII to avoid hemorrhage.Also, hemophiliacs should be vaccinated against hepati-tis. Medications or drugs that promote bleeding, such asaspirin , should be avoided.\nVarious types of factors VIII and IX are available to\nreplace a patient’s missing factors. These are adminis-tered intravenously (directly into the patient’s veins byneedle). These factor preparations may be obtained froma single donor, by pooling the donations of as many asthousands of donors, or by laboratory creation throughhighly advanced genetic techniques.\nThe frequency of treatment with factors depends on\nthe severity of the individual patient’s disease. Patientswith relatively mild disease will only require treatment inthe event of injury, or to prepare for scheduled surgical ordental procedures. Patients with more severe disease willrequire regular treatment to avoid spontaneous bleeding.\nWhile appropriate treatment of hemophilia can both\ndecrease suffering and be life-saving, complications asso-ciated with treatment can also be quite serious. About20% of all patients with hemophilia A begin to produce\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1584Hemophiliachemicals in their bodies which rapidly destroy infused\nfactor VIII. The presence of such a chemical may greatlyhamper efforts to prevent or stop a major hemorrhage.\nIndividuals who receive factor prepared from pooled\ndonor blood are at risk for serious infections that may bepassed through blood. Hepatitis, a severe and potentiallyfatal viral liver infection, may be contracted from pooledfactor preparations. Recently, a good deal of concern hasbeen raised about the possibility of hemophiliacs con-tracting a fatal slow virus infection of the brain(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ) from blood products.\nUnfortunately, pooled factor preparations in the early1980s were contaminated with human immunodeficien-\ncyvirus (HIV), the virus which causes AIDS . A large\nnumber of hemophiliacs were infected with HIV andsome statistics show that HIV is still the leading cause ofdeath among hemophiliacs. Currently, careful methods of\ndonor testing, as well as methods of inactivating virusespresent in donated blood, have greatly lowered this risk.\nThe most exciting new treatments currently being\nresearched involve efforts to transfer new genes to hemo-philiacs. These new genes would have the ability to pro-duce the missing factors. As yet, these techniques are notbeing performed on humans, but there is great hope thateventually this type of gene therapy will be available.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis is very difficult to generalize. Because\nthere are so many variations in the severity of hemophil-ia, and because much of what befalls a hemophiliacpatient will depend on issues such as physical activitylevel and accidental injuries, statistics on prognosis arenot generally available.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGenetics and Public Health in the 21st Century: Using Genetic\nInformation to Improve Health and Prevent Disease, edit-\ned by Muin J.

    "content": "Hemophilus infections\nDefinition\nHemophilus infections, most of which are due to\nHaemophilus influenzae infections, are a group of conta-\ngious diseases that are caused by a gram-negative bac-terium, and affect only humans. Some hemophilus infec-tions are potentially fatal.\nDescription\nH. influenzae is a common organism worldwide; it\nhas been found in the nasal secretions of as many as 90%of healthy individuals in the general population. Hemo-philus infections are characterized by acute inflammationwith a discharge (exudate). They may affect almost anyorgan system, but are most common in the respiratorytract. The organism can be transmitted by person-to-per-son contact, or by contact with nasal discharges and otherbody fluids. Hemophilus infections in the United Statesare most likely to spread in the late winter or early spring.\nThe primary factor influencing the rate of infection\nis age; children between the ages of six months and fouryears are most vulnerable to H. influenzae . In previous\nyears, about 50% of children would acquire a hemo-philus infection before reaching one year of age; almostall children would develop one before age three. Thesefigures are declining, however, as a result of the increas-ing use of hemophilus vaccines for children.\nAdults are also susceptible to hemophilus diseases.\nH. influenzae pneumonia is a common nosocomial infec-\ntion (illnesses contracted in hospitals). The rate of hemo-philus infections in the adult population has increasedover the past 40 years. The reasons for this change areunclear, but some researchers speculate that the overuseof antibiotics has led to the development of drug-resis-\ntant strains of H. influenzae . The risk factors for hemo-\nphilus infections among adults include:\n• smoking• alcoholism\n• chronic lung disease\n• old age• living in a city or institutional housing with a large\ngroup of people\n• poor nutrition and hygiene\n• HIV infection, or other immune system disorder\nCauses and symptoms\nHemophilus infections are primarily caused by\nHaemophilus influenzae , a gram-negative bacterium that\nis capable of spreading from the nasal tissues and upperairway, where it is usually found, to the chest, throat, ormiddle ear. The organism sometimes invades localizedareas of tissue, producing meningitis ,infectious arthri-\ntis,conjunctivitis ,cellulitis ,epiglottitis , or inflamma-\ntion of the membrane surrounding the heart. The mostserious infections are caused by a strain called H.\ninfluenzae b (Hib). Before routine vaccination , Hib was\nthe most common cause of bacterial meningitis, andresponsible for most of the cases of acquired mental\nretardation in the United States.\nHemophilus infections in children\nBACTERIAL SEPSIS IN THE NEWBORN. Bacterial sep-\nsis(sepsis is the presence of illness-causing microorgan-\nisms, or their poisons, in the blood) is a potentially fatalillness in newborn infants. The child may acquire the dis-ease organism as it passes through the mother’s birthcanal, or from the hospital environment. H. influenzae\ncan also produce inflammations of the eye (conjunctivi-tis) in newborn children. The signs of sepsis may includefever , crankiness, feeding problems, breathing difficul-\nties, pale or mottled skin, or drowsiness. Premature birthis the most significant risk factor for hemophilus infec-tions in newborns.\nEPIGLOTTITIS. Epiglottitis is a potentially fatal\nhemophilus infection. Although children are more likelyto develop epiglottitis, it can occur in adults as well.When the epiglottis (a piece of cartilage behind thetongue which protects the opening to the windpipe byopening and closing) is infected, it can swell to the pointwhere it blocks the windpipe. The symptoms of epiglotti-tis include a sudden high fever, drooling, the feeling of anobject stuck in the throat, and stridor . The epiglottis will\nlook swollen and bright red if the doctor examines thepatient’s throat with a laryngoscope (a viewing device).\nMENINGITIS. Meningitis caused by Hib is most\ncommon in children between nine months and four yearsof age. The child usually develops upper respiratorysymptoms followed by fever, loss of appetite, vomiting,headache , and a stiff or sore neck or back. In severe\ncases, the child may have convulsions or go into shock\nor coma .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1586Hemophilus infectionsOTHER INFECTIONS. Hib is the second most com-\nmon cause of middle ear infection and sinusitis in chil-\ndren. The symptoms of sinusitis include fever, pain ,bad\nbreath , and coughing. Children may also develop infec-\ntious arthritis from Hib. The joints most frequentlyaffected are the large weight-bearing joints.\nHemophilus infections in adults\nPNEUMONIA. Hib pneumonia is the most common\nhemophilus infection in adults. The symptoms includeempyema (sputum containing pus), and fever. The\nhemophilus organism can usually be identified from spu-tum samples. Hib pneumonia is increasingly common inthe elderly.\nMENINGITIS. Meningitis caused by Hib can develop\nin adults as a complication of an ear infection or sinusi-tis. The symptoms are similar to those in children but areusually less severe in adults.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is usually based on a combination of\nthe patient’s symptoms and the results of blood counts,cultures, or antigen detection tests.\nLaboratory tests\nLaboratory tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis\nof hemophilus infections. The bacterium can be grown onchocolate agar, or identified by blood cultures or Gramstain of body fluids. Antigen detection tests can be used toidentify hemophilus infections in children. These testsinclude latex agglutination and electrophoresis.\nOther laboratory findings that are associated with\nhemophilus infections include anemia (low red bloodcell count), and a drop in the number of white blood cellsin children with severe infections. Adults often show anabnormally high level of white blood cells; cell counts of15,000–30,000/mm\n3are not unusual.\nTreatment\nBecause some hemophilus infections are potentially\nfatal, treatment is started without waiting for the resultsof laboratory tests.\nMedications\nHemophilus infections are treated with antibiotics.\nPatients who are severely ill are given ampicillin or athird-generation cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime orceftriaxone, intravenously. Patients with milder infec-tions are given oral antibiotics, including amoxicillin,cefaclor, erythromycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa-zole. Patients who are allergic to penicillin are usually\ngiven cefaclor or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\nPatients with Hib strains that are resistant to ampi-\ncillin may be given chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicolis not a first-choice drug because of its side effects,including interference with bone marrow production ofblood cells.\nThe duration of antibiotic treatment depends on the\nlocation and severity of the hemophilus infection. Adultswith respiratory tract infections, or Hib pneumonia, areusually given a 10–14 day course of antibiotics. Menin-gitis is usually treated for 10–14 days, but a seven-daycourse of treatment with ceftriaxone appears to be suffi-cient for infants and children. Ear infections are treatedfor seven to 10 days.\nSupportive care\nPatients with serious hemophilus infections require\nbed rest and a humidified environment (such as a croup\ntent) if the respiratory tract is affected. Patients withepiglottitis frequently require intubation (insertion of abreathing tube) or a tracheotomy to keep the airway open.\nPatients with inflammation of the heart membrane, pneu-monia, or arthritis may need surgical treatment to draininfected fluid from the chest cavity or inflamed joints.\nSupportive care also includes monitoring of blood\ncell counts for patients using chloramphenicol, ampi-cillin, or other drugs that may affect production of bloodcells by the bone marrow.\nPrognosis\nThe most important factors in the prognosis are the\nseverity of the infection and promptness of treatment.Untreated hemophilus infections—particularly meningi-tis, sepsis, and epiglottitis—have a high mortality rate.Bacterial sepsis of the newborn has a mortality ratebetween 13–50%. The prognosis is usually good forpatients with mild infections who are treated withoutdelay. Children who develop Hib arthritis sometimeshave lasting problems with joint function.\nPrevention\nHemophilus vaccines\nThere are three different vaccines for hemophilus\ninfections used to immunize children in the United States:PRP-D, HBOC, and PRP-OMP. PRP-D is used only inchildren older than 15 months. HBOC is administered toinfants at two, four, and six months after birth, with abooster dose at 15–18 months. PRP-OMP is administeredto infants at two and four months, with the third dose at\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1587Hemophilus infectionsthe child’s first birthday. All three vaccines are given by\nintramuscular injection. About 5% of children may devel-op fever or soreness in the area of the injection.\nOther measures\nOther preventive measures include isolating patients\nwith respiratory hemophilus infections; treating appro-priate contacts of infected patients with rifampin; main-taining careful standards of cleanliness in hospitals,including proper disposal of soiled tissues; and washinghands properly.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAbzug, Mark J. “Infectious Diseases: Bacterial, Spirochetal,\nProtozoal, Metazoal, & Mycotic.” In Handbook of Pedi-\natrics , ed.

Thepatient may or may not have chest pain .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1588HemoptysisCauses and symptoms\nHemoptysis can be caused by a range of disorders:\n• Infections. These include pneumonia ; tuberculosis ;\naspergillosis ; and parasitic diseases, including ascaria-\nsis,amebiasis , and paragonimiasis.\n• Tumors that erode blood vessel walls.\n• Drug abuse. Cocaine can cause massive hemoptysis.\n• Trauma. Chest injuries can cause bleeding into the lungs.\n• Vascular disorders, including aneurysms, pulmonary\nembolism , and malformations of the blood vessels.\n• Bronchitis. Its most common cause is long-term smok-\ning.\n• Foreign object(s) in the airway.\n• Blood clotting disorders.\n• Bleeding following such surgical procedures as\nbronchial biopsies and heart catheterization.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of hemoptysis is complicated by the\nnumber of possible causes.\nPatient history\nIt is important for the doctor to distinguish between\nblood from the lungs and blood coming from the nose,mouth, or digestive tract. Patients may aspirate, orbreathe, blood from the nose or stomach into their lungsand cough it up. They may also swallow blood from the\nchest area and then vomit. The doctor will ask aboutstomach ulcers, repeated vomiting, liver disease, alco-\nholism , smoking, tuberculosis, mitral valve disease, or\ntreatment with anticoagulant medications.\nPhysical examination\nThe doctor will examine the patient’s nose, throat,\nmouth, and chest for bleeding from these areas and forsigns of chest trauma. The doctor also listens to thepatient’s breathing and heartbeat for indications of heartabnormalities or lung disease.\nLaboratory tests\nLaboratory tests include blood tests to rule out clot-\nting disorders, and to look for food particles or other evi-dence of blood from the stomach. Sputum can be testedfor fungi, bacteria, or parasites.\nX-ray and bronchoscopy\nChest x-rays and bronchoscopy are the most impor-\ntant studies for evaluating hemoptysis.

    "title": "Hemorrhagic fevers",
    "content": "Hemorrhagic fevers\nDefinition\nHemorrhagic fevers are caused by viruses that exist\nthroughout the world. However, they are most commonin tropical areas. Early symptoms, such as muscle achesand fever , can progress to a mild illness or to a more\ndebilitating, potentially fatal disease. In severe cases, aprominent symptom is bleeding, or hemorrhaging, fromorifices and internal organs.\nDescription\nAlthough hemorrhagic fevers are regarded as emerg-\ning diseases, they probably have existed for many years.This designation isn’t meant to imply that they are newlydeveloping, but rather that human exposure to thecausative viruses is increasing to the point of concern.\nThese viruses are maintained in nature in insect,\narthropod (insects, spiders and other invertebrates withexternal hard skeletons), or animal populations—so-called disease reservoirs. Individuals within these popula-tions become infected with a virus but do not die from it.In many cases, they don’t even develop symptoms. Thenthe viruses are transmitted from a reservoir population tohumans by vectors—either members of the reservoir pop-ulation or an intervening species, such as mosquitoes.Hemorrhagic fevers are generally endemic, or\nlinked to specific locations. If many people reside in anendemic area, the number of cases may soar. For exam-ple,dengue fever , a type of hemorrhagic fever, affects\napproximately 100 million people annually. A large per-centage of those infected live in densely populatedsoutheast Asia; an area in which the disease vector, amosquito, thrives. Some hemorrhagic fevers are exceed-ingly rare, because people very infrequently encounterthe virus. Marburg hemorrhagic fever, which has affect-ed fewer than 40 people since its discovery in 1967, pro-vides one such example. Fatality rates are also variable.In cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever-dengue shocksyndrome, 1–5% of the victims perish. On the other endof the spectrum is Ebola, an African hemorrhagic fever,that kills 30–90% of those infected.\nThe onset of hemorrhagic fevers may be sudden or\ngradual, but all of them are linked by the potential forhemorrhaging. However, not all cases progress to thisvery serious symptom. Hemorrhaging may be attribut-able to the destruction of blood coagulating factors or toincreased permeability of body tissues. The severity ofbleeding ranges from petechiae, which are pinpoint hem-orrhages under the skin surface, to distinct bleeding frombody orifices such as the nose or vagina.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers are found\nmost commonly in tropical locations; however, some arefound in cooler climates. Typical disease vectors includerodents, ticks, or mosquitoes, but person-to-person trans-mission in health care settings or through sexual contactcan also occur.\nFiloviruses\nEbola is the most famous of the Filoviridae, a virus\nfamily that also includes the Marburg virus. Ebola isendemic to Africa, particularly the Republic of theCongo and Sudan; the Marburg virus is found in sub-Saharan Africa. The natural reservoir of filoviruses isunknown. The incubation period, or time between infec-tion and appearance of symptoms, is thought to last threeto eight days, possibly longer.\nSymptoms appear suddenly, and include severe\nheadache , fever, chills, muscle aches, malaise, and\nappetite loss. These symptoms may be accompanied bynausea, vomiting, diarrhea , and abdominal pain . Vic-\ntims become apathetic and disoriented. Severe bleedingcommonly occurs from the gastrointestinal tract, noseand throat, and vagina. Other bleeding symptoms includepetechiae and oozing from injection sites. Ebola is fatalin 30–90% of cases.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1590Hemorrhagic feversArenaviruses\nViruses of the Arenaviridae family cause the Argen-\ntinian, Brazilian, Bolivian, and Venezuelan hemorrhagicfevers. Lassa fever, which occurs in west Africa, also aris-es from an arenavirus. Infected rodents, the natural reser-voir, shed virus particles in their urine and saliva, whichhumans may inhale or otherwise come in contact with.\nFever, muscle aches, malaise, and appetite loss gradu-\nally appear one to two weeks after infection with the SouthAmerican viruses. Initial symptoms are followed byheadache, back pain, dizziness , and gastrointestinal upset.\nThe face and chest appear flushed and the gums begin tobleed. In about 30% of cases, the disease progresses tobleeding under the skin and from the mucous membranes,and/or to effects on the nervous system, such as delirium ,\ncoma , and convulsions. Untreated, South American hem-\norrhagic fevers have a 10–30% fatality rate.\nLassa fever also begins gradually, following an 8–14\nday incubation. Initial symptoms resemble those of theSouth American hemorrhagic fevers, followed by a sore\nthroat , muscle and joint pain, severe headache, pain\nabove the stomach, and a dry cough . The face and neck\nbecome swollen, and fluid may accumulate in the lungs.Bleeding occurs in 15–20% of infected individuals,mostly from the gums and nose. Overall, the fatality rateis lower than 2%, but hospitals may encounter 20% fatal-ity rates, treating typically the most serious of cases.\nFlaviviruses\nThe Flaviviridae family includes the viruses that\ncause yellow and dengue fevers.\nYellow fever occurs in tropical areas of the Americas\nand Africa and is transmitted from monkeys to humans bymosquitoes. The virus may produce a mild, possibly unno-ticed illness, but some individuals are suddenly strickenwith a fever, weakness, low back pain , muscle pain, nau-\nsea, and vomiting. This phase lasts one to seven days, afterwhich the symptoms recede for one to two days. Symp-toms then return with greater intensity, along with jaun-\ndice, delirium, seizures, stupor, and coma. Bleeding\noccurs from the mucous membranes and under the skinsurface, and dark blood appears in stools and vomit.\nMosquitoes also transmit the dengue virus. Dengue\nfever is endemic in southeast Asia and areas of the Amer-icas. Cases have also been reported in the Caribbean,Saudi Arabia, and northern Australia. This virus causeseither the mild dengue fever or the more serious denguehemorrhagic fever-dengue shock syndrome (DHF-DSS).\nIn children, dengue fever is characterized by a sore\nthroat, runny nose, slight cough, and a fever lasting for aweek or less. Older children and adults experience moreKEY TERMS\nAntibody —A molecule created by the body’s\nimmune system to combat a specific infectiousagent, such as a virus or bacteria.\nAntigen —A specific feature, such as a protein, on\nan infectious agent.

The skin appears flushed, andintense pain occurs in the bones and limbs. After nearly aweek, the fever subsides for one to two days beforereturning. Minor hemorrhaging, such as from the gums,or more serious gastrointestinal bleeding may occur.\nDHF-DSS primarily affects children younger than\n15 years. The symptoms initially resemble those ofdengue fever in adults, without the bone and limb pain.As the fever begins to abate, the individual’s conditionworsens and hemorrhaging occurs from the nose, gums,and injection sites. Bleeding is also seen from the gas-trointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts.\nBunyaviruses\nThe Bunyaviridae family includes several hundred\nviruses but only a few are responsible for hemorrhagicfevers in humans.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1591Hemorrhagic feversRift Valley fever is caused by the phlebovirus, found in\nsub-Saharan Africa and the Nile delta. Natural reservoirsare wild and domestic animals, and transmission occursthrough contact with infected animals or through mosquitobites. The incubation period lasts 3–12 days. Most cases ofRift Valley fever are mild and may be symptomless. Ifsymptoms develop, they include fever, backache, muscleand joint pain, and headache. Hemorrhagic symptomsoccur rarely; while death , which occurs in fewer than 3%\nof cases, is attributable to massive liver damage.\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by\nnairovirus and occurs in central and southern Africa,Asia, Eurasia, and the Middle East. The virus is found inhares, birds, ticks, and domestic animals and may betransmitted by ticks or by contact with infected animals.The nairovirus incubation period is three to 12 days; afterwhich an individual experiences fever, chills, headache,severe muscle pain, pain above the stomach, nausea,vomiting, and appetite loss. Bleeding under the skin andgastrointestinal and vaginal bleeding may develop in themost severe cases. Death rates range from 10% in south-ern Russia to 50% in parts of Asia.\nHemorrhagic fever with renal (kidney) syndrome is\ncaused by the hantaviruses: Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala,and Dobrava. Hantaan virus occurs in northern Asia, theFar East, and the Balkans; Seoul virus is found world-wide; Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia and north-ern Europe; while Dobrava virus occurs in the Balkans.Wild rodents are the natural reservoirs and transmit thevirus via their excrement or body fluids or through directcontact. Initial symptoms develop within 10–40 days andinclude fever, headache, muscle pain, and dizziness.Other symptoms are blurry vision, abdominal and backpain, nausea, and vomiting. High levels of protein in theurine signal kidney damage; hemorrhaging may alsooccur. Death rates range from 0–10%.\nDiagnosis\nSince the hemorrhagic fevers share symptoms with\nmany other diseases, positive identification of the diseaserelies on evidence of the viruses in the bloodstream—such as detection of antigens and antibodies—or isola-\ntion of the virus from the body. Disruptions in the nor-\nmal levels of bloodstream components may be helpful indetermining some, but not all, hemorrhagic fevers.\nTreatment\nLassa fever, and possibly other hemorrhagic fevers,\nrespond to ribavirin, an antiviral medication. However,most of the hemorrhagic fever viruses can only be treatedwith supportive care. Such care centers around maintain-ing correct fluid and electrolyte balances in the body and\nprotecting the patient against secondary infections.Heparin and vitamin K administration, coagulation fac-tor replacement, and blood transfusions may be effectivein lessening or stopping hemorrhage in some cases.\nPrognosis\nRecovery from some hemorrhagic fevers is more\ncertain than from others. The filoviruses are among themost lethal; fatality rates for Ebola range from 30–90%,while DHF-DSS cases result in a 1–5% fatality rate.Whether a case occurs during an epidemic or as an isolat-ed case also has a bearing on the outcome. For example,isolated cases of yellow fever have a 5% mortality rate,but 20–50% of epidemic cases may be fatal.\nPermanent disability can occur with some types of\nhemorrhagic fever. About 10% of severely ill Rift Valleyfever victims suffer retina damage and may be perma-nently blind, and 25% of South American hemorrhagicfever victims suffer potentially permanent deafness.\nProper treatment is vital. In cases of DHF-DSS,\nfatality can be reduced from 40–50% to less than 2%with adequate medical care. For individuals who survivehemorrhagic fevers, prolonged convalescence is usuallyinevitable. However, survivors seem to gain lifelongimmunity against the virus that made them ill.\nPrevention\nHemorrhagic fevers can be prevented through vector\ncontrol and personal protection measures. Attempts havebeen made in urban and settled areas to destroy mosquitoand rodent populations. In areas where such measures areimpossible, individuals can use insect repellents, mosqui-to netting, and other methods to minimize exposure.\nVaccines have been developed against yellow fever,\nArgentinian hemorrhagic fever, and Crimean-Congohemorrhagic fever.

    "content": "Hemorrhoids\nDefinition\nHemorrhoids are enlarged veins in the anus or lower\nrectum. They often go unnoticed and usually clear upafter a few days, but can cause long-lasting discomfort,bleeding and be excruciatingly painful. Effective medicaltreatments are available, however.\nDescription\nHemorrhoids (also called piles) can be divided into\ntwo kinds, internal and external. Internal hemorrhoids lieinside the anus or lower rectum, beneath the anal or rec-tal lining. External hemorrhoids lie outside the analopening. Both kinds can be present at the same time.\nHemorrhoids are a very common medical complaint.\nMore than 75% of Americans have hemorrhoids at somepoint in their lives, typically after age 30. Pregnantwomen often develop hemorrhoids, but the conditionusually clears up after childbirth . Men are more likely\nthan women to suffer from hemorrhoids that require pro-fessional medical treatment.\nCauses and symptoms\nPrecisely why hemorrhoids develop is unknown.\nResearchers have identified a number of reasons toexplain hemorrhoidal swelling, including the simple factthat people’s upright posture places a lot of pressure onthe anal and rectal veins. Aging ,obesity ,pregnancy ,\nchronic constipation or diarrhea , excessive use of ene-\nmas or laxatives , straining during bowel movements,\nand spending too much time on the toilet are consideredcontributing factors. Heredity may also play a part insome cases. There is no reason to believe that hemor-rhoids are caused by jobs requiring, for instance, heavylifting or long hours of sitting, although activities of thatkind may make existing hemorrhoids worse.\nThe commonest symptom of internal hemorrhoids is\nbright red blood in the toilet bowl or on one’s feces ortoilet paper. When hemorrhoids remain inside the anusthey are almost never painful, but they can prolapse (pro-trude outside the anus) and become irritated and sore.Sometimes, prolapsed hemorrhoids move back into theanal canal on their own or can be pushed back in, but atother times they remain permanently outside the anusuntil treated by a doctor.\nSmall external hemorrhoids usually do not produce\nsymptoms. Larger ones, however, can be painful andinterfere with cleaning the anal area after a bowel move-ment. When, as sometimes happens, a blood clot formsin an external hemorrhoid (creating what is called athrombosed hemorrhoid), the skin around the anusbecomes inflamed and a very painful lump develops. Onrare occasions the clot will begin to bleed after a fewdays and leave blood on the underwear. A thrombosedhemorrhoid will not cause an embolism .\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis begins with a visual examination of the\nanus, followed by an internal examination during whichthe doctor carefully inserts a gloved and lubricated fingerinto the anus. The doctor may also use an anoscope, asmall tube that allows him or her to see into the analcanal. Under some circumstances the doctor may wish tocheck for other problems by using a sigmoidoscope orcolonoscope, a flexible instrument that allows inspectionof the lower colon (in the case of the sigmoidoscope) orthe entire colon (in the case of the colonoscope).\nTreatment\nHemorrhoids can often be effectively dealt with by\ndietary and lifestyle changes. Softening the feces andavoiding constipation by adding fiber to one’s diet isimportant, because hard feces lead to straining during defe-cation. Fruit, leafy vegetables, and whole-grain breads andcereals are good sources of fiber, as are bulk laxatives andfiber supplements such as Metamucil or Citrucel. Exercis-ing, losing excess weight, and drinking six to eight glassesa day of water or another liquid (not alcohol) also helps.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1593Hemorrhoids\nClinical photo of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid. (Cus-\ntom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)Soap or toilet paper that is perfumed may irritate the anal\narea and should be avoided, as should excessive cleaning,rubbing, or wiping of that area. Reading in the bathroom isalso considered a bad idea, because it adds to the time onespends on the toilet and may increase the strain placed onthe anal and rectal veins. After each bowel movement, wip-ing with a moistened tissue or pad sold for that purposehelps lessen irritation. Hemorrhoid pain is often eased by\nsitting in a tub of warm water for about 10 or 15 minutestwo to four times a day ( sitz bath ). A cool compress or ice\npack to reduce swelling is also recommended (the ice packshould be wrapped in a cloth or towel to prevent direct con-tact with the skin). Many people find that over-the-counterhemorrhoid creams and foams bring relief, but these med-ications do not make hemorrhoids disappear.\nWhen painful hemorrhoids do not respond to home-\nbased remedies, professional medical treatment is neces-sary. The choice of treatment depends on the type ofhemorrhoid, what medical equipment is available, andother considerations.Rubber band ligation is probably the most widely\nused of the many treatments for internal hemorrhoids(and the least costly for the patient). This procedure isperformed in the office of a family doctor or specialist, orin a hospital on an outpatient basis. An applicator is usedto place one or two small rubber bands around the base ofthe hemorrhoid, cutting off its blood supply. After three to10 days the bands, the hemorrhoid falls off, leaving a sorethat heals in a week or two. Because internal hemorrhoidsare located in a part of the anus that does not sense pain,anesthetic is unnecessary and the procedure is painless inmost cases. Although there can be minor discomfort andbleeding for a few days after the bands are applied, com-plications are rare and most people are soon able to returnto work and other activities. If more than one hemorrhoidexists or if banding is not entirely effective the first time(as occasionally happens), the procedure may need to berepeated a few weeks later. After five years, 15–20% ofpatients experience a recurrence of internal hemorrhoids,but in most cases all that is needed is another banding.\nExternal hemorrhoids, and some prolapsed internal\nhemorrhoids, are removed by conventional surgery in ahospital. Depending on the circumstances, this requires alocal, regional, or general anesthetic. Surgery does causea fair amount of discomfort, but an overnight hospitalstay is usually not necessary. Full healing takes two tofour weeks, but most people are able to resume normalactivities at the end of a week. Hemorrhoids rarely returnafter surgery.\nAlternative treatment\nLike mainstream practitioners, alternative practition-\ners stress the importance of a high-fiber diet. To prevent\nhemorrhoids by strengthening the veins of the anus, rec-tum, and colon, they recommend blackberries, blueber-ries, cherries, vitamin C, butcher’s broom ( Ruscus\naculeatus ), and flavonoids (plant pigments found in fruit\nand fruit products, tea, and soy). Herbal teas, ointments,and suppositories, and other kinds of herbal preparations,are suggested for reducing discomfort and eliminatinghemorrhoids. In particular, pilewort ( Ranunculusficaria ),\napplied in an ointment or taken as a tea, can reduce thepain of external hemorrhoids. Acupuncture ,acupres-\nsure,aromatherapy , and homeopathy are also used to\ntreat hemorrhoids.\nPrognosis\nHemorrhoids do not cause cancer and are rarely\ndangerous or life threatening. Most clear up after a fewdays without professional medical treatment. However,because colorectal cancer and other digestive system dis-eases can cause anal bleeding and other hemorrhoid-like\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1594Hemorrhoids\nFigure BAnoscopeGrasping \nforceps\nLigatorRubberbandHemorrhoid\nFigure A\nRubber band ligation is probably the most widely used\ntreatment for internal hemorrhoids.

    "title": "Hepatitis A",
    "content": "Hepatitis A\nDefinition\nHepatitis A is an inflammation of the liver caused by\na virus, the hepatitis A virus (HA V). It varies in severity,running an acute course, generally starting within two tosix weeks after contact with the virus, and lasting nolonger than two or three months. HA V may occur in sin-gle cases after contact with an infected relative or sexpartner. Alternately, epidemics may develop when foodor drinking water is contaminated by the feces of aninfected person.\nDescription\nHepatitis A was previously known as infectious\nhepatitis because it spread relatively easily from thoseinfected to close household contacts. Once the infectionends, there is no lasting, chronic phase of illness. Howev-er it is not uncommon to have a second episode of symp-toms about a month after the first; this is called a relapse,but it is not clear that the virus persists when symptomsrecur. Both children and adults may be infected by HA V .Children are the chief victims, but very often have nomore than a flu-like illness or no symptoms at all (so-called “subclinical” infection), whereas adults are farlikelier to have more severe symptoms.\nEpidemics of HA V infection can infect dozens and\neven hundreds (or, on rare occasions, thousands) of per-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1595Hepatitis Asons. In the public’s mind, outbreaks of hepatitis A usual-\nly are linked with the eating of contaminated food at arestaurant. It is true that food-handlers, who may them-selves have no symptoms, can start an alarming, wide-spread epidemic. Many types of food can be infected bysewage containing HA V , but shellfish, such as clams andoysters, are common culprits.\nApart from contaminated food and water, certain\ngroups are at increased risk of getting infectioushepatitis:\n• Children at day care centers make up an estimated\n14–40% of all cases of HA V infection in the UnitedStates. Changing diapers transmits infection throughfecal-oral contact. Toys and other objects may remaincontaminated for some time. Often a child withoutsymptoms brings the infection home to siblings andparents.\n• Troops living under crowded conditions at military\ncamps or in the field. During World War II there werean estimated five million cases in German soldiers andcivilians.\n• Anyone living in heavily populated and squalid condi-\ntions, such as the very poor and those placed in refugeeor prisoner-of-war camps.\n• Homosexual men are increasingly at risk of HA V infec-\ntion from oral-anal sexual contact.\n• Travelers visiting an area where hepatitis A is common\nare at risk of becoming ill.Causes and symptoms\nThe time from exposure to HA V and the onset of\nsymptoms ranges from two to seven weeks and averagesabout a month. The virus is passed in the feces, especiallylate during this incubation period, before symptoms firstappear. Infected persons are most contagious starting aweek or so before symptoms develop, and remain so upuntil the time jaundice (yellowing of the skin) is noted.\nOften the first symptoms to appear are fatigue ,\naching all over, nausea, and a loss of appetite. Those wholike drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes may lose\ntheir taste for them. Mild fever is common; it seldom is\nhigher than 101°F (38.3°C). The liver often enlarges,causing pain or tenderness in the right upper part of the\nabdomen. Jaundice then develops, typically lasting sevento ten days. Many patients do not visit the doctor untiltheir skin turns yellow. As many as three out of four chil-dren have no symptoms of HA V infection, but about 85%of adults will have symptoms. Besides jaundice, thecommonest are abdominal pain, loss of appetite, andfeeling generally poorly.\nSpecial situations\nAn occasional patient with hepatitis A will remain\njaundiced for a month, two months or even longer, buteventually the jaundice will pass. Very rarely, a patientwill develop such severe hepatitis that the liver fails.HA V infection causes about 100 deaths each year in theUnited States. In developed countries, a pregnant womanwho contracts hepatitis A can be expected to do wellalthough a different form of viral hepatitis ( hepatitis E )\ncan cause severe infection in pregnant women. In devel-oping countries, however, the infection may prove fatal,probably because nutrition is not adequate.\nDiagnosis\nThe early, flu-like symptoms and jaundice, as well\nas rapid recovery, suggest infectious hepatitis withoutspecial tests being done. If there is any question, a spe-cialist in gastrointestinal disorders or infectious diseasescan confirm the diagnosis—the detection of a specificantibody, called hepatitis A IgM antibody, that developswhen HA V is present in the body. This test always regis-ters positive when a patient has symptoms, and shouldcontinue to register positive for four to six months. How-ever, hepatitis A IgM antibody will persist lifelong in theblood and is protective against reinfection.\nTreatment\nOnce symptoms appear, no antibiotics or other medi-\ncines will shorten the course of infectious hepatitis. Patients\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1596Hepatitis A\nHepatitis A virus magnified 225,000 times. (Custom Medical\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)should rest in bed as needed, take a healthy diet, and avoid\ndrinking alcohol and/or any medications that could furtherdamage the liver. If a patient feels well it is all right to returnto school or work even if some jaundice remains.\nPrognosis\nMost patients with acute hepatitis, even when severe,\nbegin feeling better in two to three weeks, and recovercompletely in four to eight weeks. After recovering fromhepatitis A, a person no longer carries the virus andremains immune for life. In the United States, serious com-plications are infrequent and deaths are very rare. In theUnited States, as many as 75% of adults over 50 years ofage will have blood test evidence of previous hepatitis A.\nPrevention\nThe single best way to keep from spreading hepatitis\nA infection is to wash the hands carefully after using thetoilet. Those who are infected should not share items thatmight carry infection. Special care should be taken toavoid transmitting infection to a sex partner. Travelersshould avoid water and ice if unsure of their purity, orthey can boil water for one minute before drinking it. Allfoods eaten should be packaged, well cooked or, in thecase of fresh fruit, peeled.\nIf exposure is a possibility, infection may be prevent-\ned by an injection of a serum fraction containing antibodyagainst HA V . This material, called immune serum globu-lin (ISG), is 90% protective even when injected afterexposure—providing it is given within two weeks. Any-one living with an infected patient should receive ISG.For long-term protection, a killed virus hepatitis A vac-cine became available in 1995. More than 95% of thosevaccinated will develop an adequate amount of anti-HA Vantibody. Those who should consider being vaccinatedinclude healthcare professionals, those working at daycare and similar facilities, frequent travelers to areas withpoor sanitation, those with any form of chronic liver dis-ease, and those who are very sexually active. Starting in2000, routine immunization with the hepatitis A vaccinewas recommended for children born in states where therate of hepatitis A was two or more times the nationalaverage (Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada,New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,and Washington) and suggested in states where the ratewas 1.5 times the national average (Arkansas, Colorado,Missouri, Montana, Texas and Wyoming).\nResources\nBOOKS\nJohnson, A.

    "content": "Hepatitis, alcoholic\nDefinition\nAlcoholic hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver\ncaused by alcohol.\nDescription\nIrritation, be it from toxins or infections, causes a\nsimilar response in body organs. The response is knownas inflammation and consists of:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1597Hepatitis, alcoholic• an increase in the blood to the affected organ\n• redness and swelling of the organ\n• influx of immune agents like white blood cells and their\narsenal of chemical weapons\n•pain\nAs the acute process subsides, there is either healing\nor lingering activity. Lingering activity—chronic dis-ease—has a milder presentation with similar ingredients.Healing often takes the form of scarring, wherein normalfunctioning tissue is replaced by tough, fibrous, and non-productive scar. Both chronic disease and healing canhappen simultaneously, so that scar tissue progressivelyreplaces normal tissue. This leads to cirrhosis , a liver so\nscarred it is unable to do its job adequately.\nAlcohol can cause either an acute or a chronic dis-\nease in the liver. The acute disease can be severe, evenfatal, and can bring with it hemolysis—blood celldestruction. Alcohol can also cause a third type ofliver disease—fatty liver, in which the continuousaction of alcohol turns the liver to useless fat. Thiscondition eventually progresses to cirrhosis if the poi-\nsoning continues.\nCauses and symptoms\nInflammation of the liver can be caused by a great\nvariety of agents—poisons, drugs, viruses, bacteria, pro-tozoa, and even larger organisms like worms. Alcohol isa poison if taken in more than modest amounts. It favorsdestroying stomach lining, liver, heart muscle, and braintissue. The liver is a primary target because alcohol trav-els to the liver after leaving the intestines. Those whodrink enough to get alcohol poisoning have a tendency tobe undernourished, since alcohol provides ample caloriesbut little nutrition . It is suspected that both the alcohol\nand the poor nutrition produce alcoholic hepatitis.KEY TERMS\nCirrhosis —Disruption of normal liver structure\nand function caused by any type of chronic dis-ease such as hepatitis and alcohol abuse.\nFatty liver —An abnormal amount of fat tissue in\nthe liver caused by alcohol abuse.\nHemolysis —Disintegration of read blood cells.\nProtozoa —One celled microscopic organisms like\namoeba.Diagnosis\nHepatitis of all kinds causes notable discomfort, loss\nof appetite, nausea, pain in the liver, and usually jaundice\n(turning yellow). Blood test abnormalities are unmistak-ably those of hepatitis, but selecting from so many theprecise cause may take additional diagnostic work.\nTreatment\nAs with all poisonings, removal of the offending\nagent is primary. There is no specific treatment for alco-hol poisoning. General supportive measures must see thepatient through until the liver has healed by itself. In thecase of fulminant (sudden and severe) disease, the livermay be completely destroyed and have to be replaced bya transplant.\nPrognosis\nThe liver is robust. It can heal without scarring after\none or a few episodes of hepatitis that resolve withoutlingering. It can, moreover, regrow from a fragment of itsformer self, provided there is not disease or poison stillinhibiting it.\nPrevention\nAlcohol is lethal in many ways when ingested in\nexcess. Research suggests that the maximum healthy doseof alcohol per day is roughly one pure ounce—the amountin two cocktails, two glasses of wine, or two beers.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBoyd, William.

Many of the tissues in thebody can be the target of such an attack. While one tissuetype predominates, others may be involved in a generalmisdirection of immune activity, perhaps because thespecific target antigen is present in differing quantities ineach of the affected tissues. There seem to be hereditarycauses for autoimmunity, since these diseases tend to runin families and have genetic markers. Among the morecommon diseases believed to fall within this category arerheumatoid arthritis ,systemic lupus erythematosus ,\nmultiple sclerosis , and psoriasis .\nThe process of autoimmune disease is very similar\nto infectious disease and allergy, so that great caution isobserved in placing a disorder in this class. Germs werefound to cause several diseases originally thought to beautoimmune. Allergens cause others. Many more may beuncovered. Autoimmunity is often believed to originatewith a virus infection.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1599Hepatitis, autoimmuneHepatitis B\nDefinition\nHepatitis B is a potentially serious form of liver\ninflammation due to infection by the hepatitis B virus(HBV). It occurs in both rapidly developing (acute) andlong-lasting (chronic) forms, and is one of the common-est chronic infectious diseases worldwide. An effectivevaccine is available which will prevent the disease inthose who are later exposed.\nDescription\nCommonly called “serum hepatitis,” hepatitis B\nranges from mild to very severe. Some people who areinfected by HBV develop no symptoms and are totallyunaware of the fact, but they may carry HBV in theirblood and pass the infection on to others. In its chronicform, HBV infection may destroy the liver through ascarring process, called cirrhosis , or it may lead to can-\ncerof the liver.\nWhen a person is infected by HBV , the virus enters\nthe bloodstream and body fluids, and is able to passthrough tiny breaks in the skin, mouth, or the male orfemale genital area. There are several ways of getting theinfection:\n• During birth, a mother with hepatitis B may pass HBV\non to her infant.\n• Contact with infected blood is a common means of trans-\nmitting hepatitis B. One way this may happen is by beingstuck with a needle. Both healthcare workers and thosewho inject drugs into their veins are at risk in this way.\n• Having sex with a person infected by HBV is an impor-\ntant risk factor (especially anal sex).\nAlthough there are many ways of passing on HBV ,\nthe virus actually is not very easily transmitted. There isno need to worry that casual contact, such as shakinghands, will expose one to hepatitis B. There is no reasonnot to share a workplace or even a bathroom with aninfected person.\nMore than 300 million persons throughout the world\nare infected by HBV . While most who become chroniccarriers of the virus live in Asia and Africa, there are nofewer than 1.5 million carriers in the United States.Because carriers represent a constant threat of transmit-ting the infection, the risk of hepatitis B is always highestwhere there are many carriers. Such areas are said to beendemic for hepatitis B. When infants or young childrenliving in an endemic area are infected, their chance ofbecoming a chronic hepatitis B carrier is at least 90%.This probably is because their bodies are not able tomake the substances (antibodies) that destroy the virus.In contrast, no more than 5% of infected teenagers andadults develop chronic infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nWith the exception of HBV , all the common viruses\nthat cause hepatitis are known as RNA viruses becausethey contain ribonucleic acid or RNA as their geneticmaterial. HBV is the only deoxyribonucleic acid or DNAvirus that is a major cause of hepatitis. HBV is made upof several fragments, called antigens, that stimulate thebody’s immune system to produce the antibodies that canneutralize or even destroy the infecting virus. It is, infact, the immune reaction, not the virus, that seems tocause the liver inflammation.\nAcute hepatitis B\nIn the United States, a majority of acute HBV infec-\ntions occur in teenagers and young adults. Half of theseyouth never develop symptoms, and only about 20%—orone in five infected patients—develop severe symptomsand yellowing of the skin ( jaundice ). Jaundice occurs\nwhen the infected liver is unable to get rid of certain col-ored substances, or pigments, as it normally does. Theremaining 30% of patients have only “flu-like” symp-toms and will probably not even be diagnosed as havinghepatitis unless certain tests are done.\nThe commonest symptoms of acute hepatitis B are\nloss of appetite, nausea, generally feeling poorly, andpain or tenderness in the right upper part of the abdomen\n(where the liver is located). Compared to patients withhepatitis A or C, those with HBV infection are less able\nto continue their usual activities and require more timeresting in bed.\nOccasionally patients with HBV infection will\ndevelop joint swelling and pain (arthritis) as well ashives or a skin rash before jaundice appears. The joint\nsymptoms usually last no longer than three to seven days.\nTypically the symptoms of acute hepatitis B do not\npersist longer than two or three months. If they continuefor four months, the patient has an abnormally long-last-ing acute infection. In a small number of patients—prob-ably fewer than 3%—the infection keeps getting worseas the liver cells die off. Jaundice deepens, and patientsmay bleed easily when the levels of coagulation factors(normally made by the liver) decrease. Large amounts offluid collect in the abdomen and beneath the skin(edema ). The least common outcome of acute HBV\ninfection, seen in fewer than 1% of patients, is fulminanthepatitis, when the liver fails entirely. Only about half ofthese patients can be expected to live.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1600Hepatitis BChronic hepatitis B\nHBV infection lasting longer than six months is said\nto be chronic. After this time it is much less likely for theinfection to disappear. Not all carriers of the virus devel-op chronic liver disease; in fact, a majority have nosymptoms. But, about one in every four HBV carriers dodevelop liver disease which gets worse over time, as theliver becomes more and more scarred and less able tocarry out its normal functions. A badly scarred liver iscalled cirrhosis. Patients are likely to have an enlargedliver and spleen, as well as tiny clusters of abnormalblood vessels in the skin that resemble spiders.\nThe most serious complication of chronic HBV\ninfection is liver cancer . Worldwide this is the common-\nest cancer to occur in men. Nevertheless, the overallchance that liver cancer will develop at any time in apatient’s life is probably much lower than 10%. Patientswith chronic hepatitis B who drink or smoke are morelikely to develop liver cancer. It is not unusual for a per-son to simultaneously have both HBV infection andinfection by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus, the\ncause of AIDS ).\nDiagnosis\nHepatitis B is diagnosed by detecting one of the\nviral antigens—called hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg)—in the blood. Later in the acute disease,\nHBsAg may no longer be present, in which case a test forantibodies to a different antigen—hepatitis B core anti-gen—is used. If HBsAg can be detected in the blood forlonger than six months, chronic hepatitis B is diagnosed.A number of tests can be done to learn how well, orpoorly, the liver is working. They include blood clottingtests and tests for enzymes which are found in abnormal-ly high amounts when any form of hepatitis is present.\nTreatment\nThere are no specific treatments for acute hepatitis\nB. Patients should rest in bed as needed, continue to eat ahealthy diet, and avoid alcohol. Any non-critical surgeryshould be postponed.\nPrognosis\nEach year an estimated 150,000 persons in the Unit-\ned States get hepatitis B. More than 10,000 will requirehospital care, and as many as 5,000 will die from compli-cations of the infection. About 90% of all those infectedwill have acute disease only. A very large majority ofthese patients will recover within three months. It is theremaining 10%, with chronic infection, who account formost serious complications and deaths from HBV infec-tion.

The use of condoms during sex isalso advisable.\nIf a person is exposed to hepatitis B, a serum prepa-\nration containing a high level of antibody against HBVmay prevent infection if given within three to seven daysof exposure.

    "title": "Hepatitis C",
    "content": "Hepatitis C\nDefinition\nHepatitis C is a form of liver inflammation that causes\nprimarily a long-lasting (chronic) disease. Acute (newlydeveloped) hepatitis C is rarely observed as the early dis-ease is generally quite mild. Spread mainly by contact withinfected blood, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes mostcases of viral liver infection not due to the A and B hepatitisviruses. In fact, before other viral types were found, hepati-tis C was referred to as “non-A, non-B hepatitis.” It is not anew infection, just newly diagnosable and has been widelypresent in the U.S. population for decades.\nDescription\nHCV is a blood-borne virus that is and always was the\nmajor cause of “transfusion hepatitis,” which can developin patients who are given blood or most blood productsexcept for gamma-globulin. The existence of a thirdhepatitis virus (besides the A and B viruses) became clearin 1974, but HCV was first identified in 1989. Thereafter,tests were devised to detect the virus in blood units beforetransfusing them. As a result, since the early 1990s trans-fused blood is less commonly the cause of hepatitis C.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1602Hepatitis CThe hepatitis C form of hepatitis is generally mild in\nits early, acute stage, but it is much likelier than hepatitis\nB(85% as compared to 10%) to produce chronic liver\ndisease. Therefore, more than two of every three personswho are infected by HCV may continue to have the virusin their blood and so become carriers, who can transmitthe infection to others.\nThe most common way of transmitting hepatitis C is\nwhen blood containing the virus enters another person’scirculation through a break in the skin or the mucosa(inner lining) of the mouth or genitals. HCV also can bepassed (although uncommonly) from an infected motherto the infant she is carrying. (The risk of infection frombreast milk is very low.) Also, HCV can be rarely spreadthrough sexual intercourse. Usually, however, the sexualcontacts of chronic carriers of hepatitis C are not infected.\nThose at increased risk of developing hepatitis C\ninclude:\n• healthcare workers who come in contact with infected\nblood from a cut or bruise, or from a device or instru-ment that has been infected (“contaminated”)\n• persons who inject illicit drugs into their veins and skin,\nespecially if they share needles and syringes with otherusers\n• anyone who gets a tattoo or has his or her skin pierced\nwith an infected needle\n• persons with hemophilia (who because they bleed very\neasily may require large amounts of blood and bloodproducts over time)\n• patients with kidney disease who have periodic dialysis—\na treatment that rids their blood of toxic substances—andoften requires the patient to have blood transfusions\nAbout one-fourth of patients with hepatitis C do not\nbelong to any of these high-risk groups. Although bloodtransfusion is a much less common cause of HCV infec-\ntion than in earlier years, cases still occur. Also, sexualtransmission is possible, and may take place with eitherheterosexual or homosexual behavior.\nCauses and symptoms\nMore than half of all patients who develop hepatitis\nC have no symptoms or signs of liver disease. Some,however, may have a minor illness with flu-like symp-toms. Any form of hepatitis may keep the liver fromeliminating certain colored (pigmented) substances as itnormally does. These pigments collect in the skin, turn-ing it yellow, and also may cause yellowing of the whitesof the eyes. About one in four patients with hepatitis Cwill develop this yellowing of the skin called jaundice\n(or yellow jaundice). Some patients lose their appetiteKEY TERMS\nAntibody —A substance formed in the body in\nresponse to a foreign body, such as a virus, whichcan attack and destroy the invading foreign bodyor virus.\nCarrier —A person who, after recovering from a\nviral infection, continues to “carry” the virus in theblood and can pass it on to others who then maydevelop infection.\nContamination —Passage of an infectious organ-\nism, such as a virus, from an infected person to anobject such as a needle, which then, when used,may pass infection to another person.\nHepatocellular carcinoma —A dangerous cancer\nof the liver that may develop in patients who havehad hepatitis, sometimes as long as 20 or 30 yearsearlier.\nPorphyria —Any of a group of disturbances of por-\nphyrin metabolism characterized by excesspophyrins (various biologically active compoundswith a distinct structure) in the urine and byextreme sensitivity to light.\nand frequently feel tired. Patients may also feel nauseous\nor even vomit.\nIn most patients, HCV can still be found in the blood\nsix months after the start of acute infection, and thesepatients are considered to be carriers. If the virus persistsfor one year, it is very unlikely to disappear. About 20%of chronic carriers develop cirrhosis (scarring) of the\nliver when the virus damages or destroys large numbersof liver cells, which are then replaced by scar tissue. Cir-rhosis may develop only after a long period of time (aslong as 20 years) and often even more has passed. Most(four in five) patients will not develop cirrhosis andinstead have a mild, chronic form of infection calledchronic persistent hepatitis and when they die, will diewith, not of, the infection.\nPatients with chronic HCV infection are at risk of\ndeveloping certain very serious complications:\n• Patients with hepatitis C who develop cirrhosis may go\non to have liver cancer—called hepatocellular carcino-ma. Patients with liver cancer have an average life\nexpectancy measured in months unless the tumor istotally removed.\n• Patients also are at risk of developing a combination of\njoint pain , weakness, and areas of bleeding into the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1603Hepatitis Cskin. The kidneys and brain also may be affected. Per-\nhaps 5% of patients with chronic HCV infection devel-op this condition, called cryoglobulinemia.\n• Patients with porphyria (metabolic disturbances charac-\nterized by extreme sensitivity to light) develop blistersin areas of their skin that are exposed to sunlight. Theskin also may be easily bruised, and, in time, canbecome discolored.\nDiagnosis\nHepatitis C should be suspected if a patient develops\njaundice and reports recent contact with the blood of aperson who may have been infected. There is a blood testto detect HCV IgG antibody, a substance that the bodymakes to combat HCV . Care is required, as the test oftendoes not show positive for up to two to three months afterinfection. Also, the test only shows whether a person hasever been infected by HCV , not whether the virus is stillpresent. A less available and more expensive test measur-ing HCV RNA (the viral gene) can be found in earlyinfection before the antibody is measurable. Simplerblood tests can be done to show how much jaundice-causing pigment is in a patient’s blood, or to measure thelevels of certain proteins made by the liver. High levelsof these “liver enzymes” (called ALT and AST) indicatethat the liver is inflamed. Rising levels could suggest thatthe infection is getting worse.\nTreatment\nPatients who fail to recover promptly may be\nadvised to see a specialist in gastrointestinal disorders(which include liver disease) or infectious diseases. Abalanced diet with little fat is best, and patients shouldlimit their alcohol intake, or, better, avoid alcohol alto-gether. Any medication that can cause liver damageshould be avoided. The amount of time in bed dependson how poorly a particular patient feels.\nA natural body protein, interferon alpha, now can be\nmade in large amounts by genetic engineering, andimproves the outlook for many patients who have chron-ic hepatitis C. The protein can lessen the symptoms ofinfection and improve liver function. Not all patientsrespond, however, and others get less benefit the longerthey take interferon. Fever and flu-like symptoms are\nfrequent side effects of this treatment. Using a high dosefor six months, nearly half of patients have respondedpositively. Half the patients who do respond well willrelapse after the drug is stopped. A newer medicationcalled ribavirin is now commonly used with interferonand, if tolerated, does increase response rates. A newerform of interferon, called pegylated interferon, is alsobeing used for treatment. Because of the problems withtreatment, many people have sought alternative medica-\ntions such as milk thistle or certain Asian herbs.\nWhen hepatitis destroys most or all of the liver, the\nonly hope may be a liver transplant. Unfortunately thenew liver usually becomes infected by HCV . On the otherhand, total liver failure is less frequent than in patientswith hepatitis B.\nPrognosis\nIn roughly one-fifth of patients who develop hepatitis\nC, the acute infection will subside, and they will recovercompletely within four to eight weeks and have no laterproblems. Other patients face two risks: they themselvesmay develop chronic liver infection and possibly seriouscomplications such as liver cancer , and, also, they will\ncontinue carrying the virus and may pass it on to others.The overall risk of developing cirrhosis, or liver scarring,is about 15% of all patients infected by HCV . Acute liverfailure is less frequent in patients with chronic hepatitis Cthan in those with other forms of hepatitis.\nPrevention\nNo vaccine has yet been developed to prevent\nhepatitis C in persons exposed to the virus. In addition,there is no role of gamma-globulin in the prevention ofthe infection. There are, however, many ways in whichinfection may be avoided:\n• Those who inject drugs should never share needles,\nsyringes, swabs, spoons, or anything else that comes incontact with bodily fluids. They should always useclean equipment.\n• Hands should be washed before and after contact with\nanother person’s blood or if the skin is penetrated.\n• The sharing of personal items should be avoided, par-\nticularly those that can puncture the skin or inside ofthe mouth, such as razors, nail files and scissors, andeven toothbrushes.\n• Condoms should be used for either vaginal or oral sex.\nIf a person does develop hepatitis C, its spread may\nbe prevented by:\n• not donating blood• not sharing personal items with others\n• wiping up any spilled blood while using gloves, house-\nhold bleach, and disposable paper towels\n• carefully covering any cut or wound with a bandaid or\ndressing\n• practicing safe sex, especially during the acute phase of\nthe infection\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1604Hepatitis CResources\nBOOKS\nEverson, Gregory T., and Hedy Weinberg.

    "title": "Hepatitis D",
    "content": "Hepatitis D\nDefinition\nHepatitis D (or delta, the Greek letter “D”), is a form\nof liver inflammation that occurs only in patients whoalso are infected by the hepatitis B virus. Infection by\nthe hepatitis delta virus (HDV) either occurs at the sametime as hepatitis B develops, or develops later wheninfection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) has entered thechronic (long-lasting) stage.\nDescription\nDelta hepatitis can be quite severe, but it is seen only\nin patients already infected by HBV . In the late 1970s,Italian physicians discovered that some patients withhepatitis B had another type of infectious agent in theirliver cells. Later the new virus—HDV—was confirmedby experimentally infecting chimpanzees. When bothviruses are present, acute infection tends to be moresevere. Furthermore, patients with both infections arelikelier than those with HBV alone to develop chronicliver disease, and, when it occurs, it is more severe.\nAbout 300 million persons worldwide carry HBV .\nOf them, at least 5% probably also have delta hepatitis.In North America HDV infection appears to be less fre-quent: 4% of all patients with acute hepatitis B haveHDV infection. The delta virus causes an estimated 2%of all cases of acute viral hepatitis in the United States.The rate of HDV infection varies widely in differentparts of the world; it is a very serious infection in somecountries and quite mild in others. Chronic delta hepatitisis a more serious disease than either chronic hepatitis Balone or hepatitis C .Certain individuals—the same ones who are at\nincreased risk of developing hepatitis B—are the primecandidates to be infected by HDV . For example:\n• Not infrequently, HDV infection occurs in patients with\nchronic HBV infection who also have hemophilia ,a\nbleeding disease. These patients are at risk because theyrequire large amounts of transfused blood and bloodproducts that may contain HDV .\n• In some areas, one-fourth to one-half of patients with\nchronic HBV infection who inject themselves withillicit drugs become infected by HDV as well. Drugabusers who share contaminated needles are likely toinfect one another.\n• Patients who get HBV infection by sexual contact may\nalso be infected by HDV , although the delta virus is lessoften spread in this way than is HBV itself. Between10–25% of homosexual men with chronic HBV infec-tion harbor the delta virus.\n• Like hepatitis B, HDV infection may develop in health-\ncare workers who are victims of a needle stick, and italso can be spread within households when personalitems such as a razor or toothbrush are shared.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe delta virus is a small and incomplete viral parti-\ncle. Perhaps this is why it cannot cause infection on itsown. Its companion virus, HBV , actually forms a cover-ing over the HDV particle. In chronically ill patients(those whose virus persists longer than six months), thecombined viruses cause inflammation throughout theliver and eventually destroy the liver cells, which are thenreplaced by scar tissue. This scarring is called cirrhosis .\nWhen HBV and HDV infections develop at the same\ntime, a condition called coinfection, recovery is the rule.Only 2–5% of patients become chronic carriers (have thevirus remain in their blood more than six months afterinfection). It may be that HDV actually keeps HBV fromreproducing as rapidly as it would if it were alone, sochronic infection is less likely.\nWhen HBV infection occurs first and is followed by\nHDV infection, the condition is called superinfection.This is a more serious situation. Between half and two-thirds of patients with superinfection develop severeacute hepatitis. Once the liver cells contain large num-bers of HBV viruses, HDV tends to reproduce moreactively. Massive infection and liver failure are morecommon in superinfection. The risk of liver cancer ,\nhowever, is no greater than from hepatitis B alone.\nAs with other forms of hepatitis, the earliest symp-\ntoms are nausea, loss of appetite, joint pains, and tired-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1605Hepatitis Dness. There may be fever (not marked) and an enlarged\nliver may cause discomfort or actual pain in the right\nupper part of the abdomen. Later, jaundice (a yellowing\nof the skin and whites of the eyes that occurs when theliver is no longer able to eliminate certain pigmentedsubstances) may develop.\nDiagnosis\nHDV infection may be diagnosed by detecting the\nantibody against the virus. Unfortunately this test can-not detect acute coinfection or superinfection as earlyas when symptoms first develop. Antibody againstHDV usually is found no sooner than 30 days aftersymptoms appear. Until recently, the virus itself couldonly be identified by testing a small sample of liver tis-sue. Scientists now are developing a blood test for HDVthat should make diagnosis faster and easier. WhenHDV is present, liver enzymes (proteins made by theliver) are present in abnormally high amounts. In somepatients with coinfection, the enzyme levels peak twice,once when HBV infection starts and again at the time ofHDV infection.\nTreatment\nAs in any form of hepatitis, patients in the acute\nstage should rest in bed as needed, eat a balanced diet,and avoid alcohol. Alpha-interferon, the natural bodysubstance which helps control hepatitis C, has generallynot been found helpful in treating hepatitis D. If the liverKEY TERMS\nAlpha-interferon —A natural body substance that\nnow can be made in large quantities and is aneffective treatment for some types of viral inflam-matory disease, including hepatitis C.\nAntibody —A substance formed in the body in\nresponse to an invading microorganism, such as avirus, which can attack and destroy the invadingvirus.\nCoinfection —Invasion of the body by two viruses\nat about the same time.\nHemophilia —A bleeding disease that may call for\nthe transfusion of large amounts of blood andblood products.\nSuperinfection —Infection by a second virus after\na previous infection by a different virus hasbecome well established.is largely destroyed and has stopped functioning, liver\ntransplantation is an option. Even when the procedure\nis successful, disease often recurs and cirrhosis mayactually develop more rapidly than before.\nPrognosis\nA large majority of patients with coinfection of\nHBV and HDV recover from an episode of acutehepatitis. However, about two-thirds of patients chroni-cally infected by HDV go on to develop cirrhosis of theliver. In one long-term study, just over half of patientswho became carriers of HDV had moderate or severeliver disease, and one-fourth of them died. If verysevere liver failure develops, the chance of a patientsurviving is no better than 50%. A liver transplant mayimprove this figure to 70%. When transplantation isdone for cirrhosis, rather than for liver failure, nearly90% of patients live five years or longer. The majorconcern with transplantation is infection of the trans-planted liver; this may occur in as many as 40% oftransplant patients.\nWhen a child with viral hepatitis develops cirrhosis,\nHDV infection is commonly responsible. A woman whodevelops delta hepatitis while pregnant will do as well asif she were not pregnant; and there is no increased riskthat the newborn will be malformed in any way.\nPrevention\nThe vaccine against hepatitis B also prevents delta\nhepatitis, since it cannot occur unless HBV infection ispresent. Hopefully, a vaccine can be developed that willkeep delta infection from developing in chronic HBVcarriers. However, if a person already has HBV infection,any exposure to blood should be strictly avoided. A highlevel of sexual activity with multiple partners is also arisk factor for delta hepatitis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nJohnson, A. Liver Disease & Gallstones.

Cramer, MD\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1606Hepatitis DHepatitis, drug-induced\nDefinition\nInflammation of the liver due to an adverse reaction\nwith a drug.\nDescription\nThe liver is a very important organ to the body. It\nis a large internal organ weighing more than threepounds in the average adult. It performs over 100 func-tions including formation of bile, detoxification of\nharmful substances, vitamin storage and metabolism ofcarbohydrates, fats and proteins. Serious complicationscould arise when the liver becomes inflamed due tohepatitis when it is not able to perform these tasks. Avirus most often causes hepatitis but certain drugs canalso induce it.\nDrug-induced hepatitis (also called toxic hepatitis)\noccurs in eight in every 10,000 people because the liverreacts abnormally during drug exposure, leading to liverdamage. This pathology causes the liver not to functionproperly and the symptoms can begin to be seen. Womentend to be affected almost twice as often as men. Olderpeople are more prone to this type of hepatitis becausetheir bodies aren’t able to repair themselves as fast asyounger people. Drugs that can be associated with drug-induced hepatitis include acetaminophen , vitamin A,\nand PTU (a drug treatment for tuberculosis ).\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are three general types of drug-induced\nhepatitis: toxic, metabolic idiosyncrasy and immunolog-ic idiosyncrasy. With toxic hepatitis liver damage as theresult of a drug complication with hepatotoxins happensto everyone who takes that particular drug. On the otherhand, hepatitis resulting from a metabolic or immunolog-ic idiosyncrasy only happens to certain people, those pre-disposed to particular idiosyncrasy.\nIn patients with a metabolic idiosyncrasy the person\nmetabolizes the drug differently than most people caus-ing a harmful by-product that damages the liver. A meta-bolic idiosyncrasy is seen in 0.1-2% of people and it iscomplicated by use of alcohol.\nWith an immunologic idiosyncrasy the patient’s\nbody recognizes the metabolized drug by-products asforeign. This leads to the destruction of liver cells con-taining the by-product via the immune system resultingin hepatitis. An immunologic idiosyncrasy is seen in lessthan one person per 10,000 (0.01%) people and is morethan twice as common in women.KEY TERMS\nHepatitis —General inflammation of the liver.\nHepatomegaly —General swelling of the liver.\nHepatotoxin —A substance that is toxic to the\nliver.\nIdiosyncrasy —A defect in that particular pathway\nresulting in an abnormality.\nThe symptoms of drug-induced hepatitis are similar\nto viral hepatitis. Drug induced hepatitis tends to beacute. If it is not caught soon enough the damage couldbe permanent resulting in chronic hepatitis. Some of thecommon symptoms are:\n• nausea\n• vomiting• headache• anorexia• jaundice\n• clay color stools\n• dark urine• hepatomegaly\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is typically made through a physical exam\nalong with a patient history to identify any possible hepa-totoxins. Blood tests are usually done as well. Anincreased white blood cell count is typical.\nTreatment\nThere isn’t any specific treatment other than imme-\ndiate discontinuance of the causative agent. Rest duringthe acute phase of the disease is vital along with theintake of fluids to maintain hydration.\nPrognosis\nUsually the symptoms will go away after the drug has\nbeen eliminated due to the liver repairing itself. A full recov-ery is typically expected unless it wasn’t treated quicklyresulting in more liver damage being done than normal.\nPrevention\nIf there is a history of liver damage certain medications\nshould not be taken.

    "title": "Hepatitis E",
    "content": "Hepatitis E\nDefinition\nThe hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a common cause of\nhepatitis that is transmitted via the intestinal tract, and isnot caused by the hepatitis A virus. Spread most often\nby contaminated drinking water, HEV infection occursmainly in developing countries.\nDescription\nHepatitis E is also known as epidemic non-A, non-B\nhepatitis. Like hepatitis A, it is an acute and short-livedillness that can sometimes cause liver failure. HEV , dis-covered in 1987, is spread by the fecal-oral route. It isconstantly present (endemic) in countries where humanwaste is allowed to get into drinking water without firstbeing purified. Large outbreaks (epidemics) haveoccurred in Asian and South American countries wherethere is poor sanitation. In the United States and Canadano outbreaks have been reported, but persons traveling toan endemic region may return with HEV .\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are at least two strains of HEV , one found in\nAsia and another in Mexico. The virus may start dividingin the gastrointestinal tract, but it grows mostly in theliver. After an incubation period (the time from when aperson is first infected by a virus until the appearance ofthe earliest symptoms) of two to eight weeks, infectedpersons develop fever , may feel nauseous, lose their\nappetite, and often have discomfort or actual pain in theright upper part of the abdomen where the liver is located.\nSome develop yellowing of the skin and the whites of theeyes ( jaundice ). Most often the illness is mild and disap-\npears within a few weeks with no lasting effects. Childrenyounger than 14 years and persons over age 50 seldomhave jaundice or show other clinical signs of hepatitis.\nHepatitis E never becomes a chronic (long-lasting)\nillness, but on rare occasions the acute illness damagesand destroys so many liver cells that the liver can nolonger function. This is called fulminant liver failure, andmay cause death . Pregnant women are at much higher\nrisk of dying from fulminant liver failure; this increasedrisk is not true of any other type of viral hepatitis. Thegreat majority of patients who recover from acute infec-tion do not continue to carry HEV and cannot pass on theinfection to others.\nDiagnosis\nHEV can be found by microscopically examining a\nstool sample, but this is not a reliable test, as the virusoften dies when stored for a short time. Like otherhepatitis viruses, HEV stimulates the body’s immunesystem to produce a substance called an antibody, whichcan swallow up and destroy the virus. Blood tests candetermine elevated antibody levels, which indicate thepresence of HEV virus in the body. Unfortunately, suchantibody blood tests are not widely available.\nTreatment\nThere is no way of effectively treating the symptoms\nof any acute hepatitis, including hepatitis E. During acuteinfection, a patient should take a balanced diet and rest inbed as needed.\nPrognosis\nIn the United States hepatitis E is not a fatal illness,\nbut elsewhere about 1–2% of those infected die ofadvanced liver failure. In pregnant women the death rateis as high as 20%. It is not clear whether having hepatitisE once guarantees against future HEV infection.\nPrevention\nMost attempts to use blood serum containing HEV\nantibody to prevent hepatitis in those exposed to HEVhave failed. Hopefully, this approach can be made towork so that pregnant women living in endemic areas canbe protected. No vaccine is available, though several arebeing tested. It also is possible that effective anti-viraldrugs will be found. The best ways to prevent hepatitis Eare to provide safe drinking water and take precautions touse sterilized water and beverages when traveling.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1608Hepatitis EResources\nBOOKS\nRosenthal, M.

    "content": "Hepatitis G\nDefinition\nHepatitis G is a newly discovered form of liver\ninflammation caused by hepatitis G virus (HGV), a dis-tant relative of the hepatitis C virus.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —A substance made by the body’s\nimmune system in response to an invading virus,the antibodies then attack and destroy the virus.\nIncubation period —The time from when a person\nis first infected by a virus until the appearance ofthe earliest symptoms.\nJaundice —Yellowing of the skin that occurs when\npigments normally eliminated by the liver collectin high amounts in the blood.\nSanitation —The process of keeping drinking\nwater, foods, or any anything else with which peo-ple come into contact free of microorganisms suchas viruses.\nVaccine —A substance prepared from a weakened\nor killed virus which, when injected, stimulatesthe immune system to produce antibodies that canprevent infection by the natural virus.Description\nHGV , also called hepatitis GB virus, was first described\nearly in 1996. Little is known about the frequency of HGVinfection, the nature of the illness, or how to prevent it.What is known is that transfused blood containing HGV hascaused some cases of hepatitis. For this reason, patients withhemophilia and other bleeding conditions who require\nlarge amounts of blood or blood products are at risk ofhepatitis G. HGV has been identified in between 1–2% ofblood donors in the United States. Also at risk are patientswith kidney disease who have blood exchange by hemodial-ysis, and those who inject drugs into their veins. It is possi-ble that an infected mother can pass on the virus to her new-born infant. Sexual transmission also is a possibility.\nOften patients with hepatitis G are infected at the\nsame time by the hepatitis B or C virus, or both. In about\nthree of every thousand patients with acute viral hepati-tis, HGV is the only virus present. There is some indica-tion that patients with hepatitis G may continue to carrythe virus in their blood for many years, and so might be asource of infection in others.\nCauses and symptoms\nSome researchers believe that there may be a group\nof GB viruses, rather than just one. Others remain doubt-ful that HGV actually causes illness. If it does, the typeof acute or chronic (long-lasting) illness that results isnot clear. When diagnosed, acute HGV infection has usu-ally been mild and brief. There is no evidence of seriouscomplications, but it is possible that, like other hepatitisviruses, HGV can cause severe liver damage resulting inliver failure. The virus has been identified in as many as20% of patients with long-lasting viral hepatitis, some ofwhom also have hepatitis C.\nDiagnosis\nThe only method of detecting HGV is a complex and\ncostly DNA test that is not widely available. Efforts areunder way, however, to develop a test for the HGV anti-body, which is formed in response to invasion by the virus.Once antibody is present, however, the virus itself general-ly has disappeared, making the test too late to be of use.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for any form of acute\nhepatitis. Patients should rest in bed as needed, avoidalcohol, and be sure to eat a balanced diet.\nPrognosis\nWhat little is known about the course of hepatitis G\nsuggests that illness is mild and does not last long. When\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1609Hepatitis Gmore patients have been followed up after the acute\nphase, it will become clear whether HGV can causesevere liver damage.\nPrevention\nSince hepatitis G is a blood-borne infection, preven-\ntion relies on avoiding any possible contact with contam-inated blood. Drug users should not share needles,syringes, or other equipment.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Liver Foundation. 1425 Pompton Ave., Cedar Grove,\nNJ 07009.

    "content": "Hepatitis virus tests\nDefinition\nViral hepatitis is any type of liver inflammation\ncaused by a viral infection. The three most commonviruses now recognized to cause liver disease are hepati-\ntis A ,hepatitis B , and hepatitis non-A, non-B (also\ncalled hepatitis C ). Several other types have been recog-\nnized: hepatitis D ,hepatitis E , and the recently identi-\nfied hepatitis G . A seventh type (hepatitis F) is suspect-\ned but not yet confirmed.\nPurpose\nThe different types of viral hepatitis produce similar\nsymptoms, but they differ in terms of transmission, courseKEY TERMS\nAntibody —A substance made by the body’s\nimmune system in response to an invading virus;antibodies then attack and destroy the virus.\nHemophilia —A bleeding disorder that often\nmakes it necessary to give patients dozens or evenhundreds of units of blood and blood productsover time.of treatment, prognosis, and carrier status. When the clini-\ncal history of a patient is insufficient for differentiation,hepatitis virus tests are used as an aid in diagnosis and inmonitoring the course of the disease. These tests arebased primarily on antigen-antibody reactions—an anti-gen being a protein foreign to the body, and an antibodyanother type of protein manufactured by lymphocytes (atype of white blood cell) to neutralize the antigen.\nDescription\nThere are five major types of viral hepatitis. The dis-\neases, along with the antigen-antibody tests available toaid in diagnosis, are described below.\nHepatitis A\nCommonly called infectious hepatitis, this is caused\nby the hepatitis A virus (HA V). It is usually a mild dis-ease, most often spread by food and water contamination,but sometimes through sexual contact. Immunologic testsare not commercially available for the HA V antigen, buttwo types of antibodies to HA V can be detected. IgM anti-body (anti-HA V/IgM), appears approximately three tofour weeks after exposure and returns to normal withinseveral months. IgG (anti-HA V/IgG) appears approxi-mately two weeks after the IgM begins to increase andremains positive. Acute hepatitis is suspected if IgM iselevated; conversely, if IgG is elevated without IgM, aconvalescent stage of HA V is presumed. IgG antibody canremain detectable for decades after infection.\nHepatitis B\nCommonly known as serum hepatitis, this is caused\nby the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The disease can be mildor severe, and it can be acute (of limited duration) orchronic (ongoing). It is usually spread by sexual contactwith another infected person, through contact withinfected blood, by intravenous drug use, or from motherto child at birth.\nHBV , also called the Dane particle, is composed of\nan inner protein core surrounded by an outer protein cap-sule. The outer capsule contains the hepatitis B surfaceantigen (HBsAg), formerly called the Australia antigen.The inner core contains HBV core antigen (HBcAg), andthe hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg). Antibodies to theseantigens are called anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HBe.Testing for these antigens and antibodies is as follows:\n• Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). This is the first\ntest for hepatitis B to become abnormal. HBsAg beginsto elevate before the onset of clinical symptoms, peaksduring the first week of symptoms, and usually disap-pears by the time the accompanying jaundice (yellow-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1610Hepatitis virus testsing of the skin and other tissues) begins to subside.\nHBsAg indicates an active HBV infection. A person isconsidered to be a carrier if this antigen persists in theblood for six or more months.\n• Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). This appears\napproximately one month after the disappearance of theHBsAg, signaling the end of the acute infection period.Anti-HBs is the antibody that demonstrates immunityafter administration of the hepatitis B vaccine. Its pres-ence also indicates immunity to subsequent infection.\n• Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). No tests are com-\nmercially available to detect this antigen.\n• Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). This appears just\nbefore acute hepatitis develops and remains elevated(although it slowly declines) for years. It is also presentin chronic hepatitis. The hepatitis B core antibody iselevated during the time lag between the disappearanceof the hepatitis B surface antigen and the appearance ofthe hepatitis B surface antibody in an interval called the“window.” During this time, the hepatitis B core anti-body is the only detectable marker of a recent hepatitisB infection.\n• Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg). This is more useful as an\nindex of infection than for diagnostic purposes. The pres-ence of this antigen correlates with early and active dis-ease, as well as with high infectivity in patients with acuteHBV infection. When HBeAg levels persist in the blood,the development of chronic HBV infection is suspected.\n• Hepatitis B e-antibody (anti-HBe). In the bloodstream,\nthis indicates a reduced risk of infectivity in patientswho have previously been HBeAg positive. Chronichepatitis B surface antigen carriers can be positive foreither HBeAg or anti-HBe, but are less infectious whenanti-HBe is present. Antibody to e antigen can persistfor years, but usually disappears earlier than anti-HBsor anti-HBc.\nHepatitis C\nPreviously known as non-A, non-B hepatitis, this\ndisease is primarily caused by the hepatitis C virus(HCV). It is generally mild, but more likely than hepati-tis B to lead to chronic liver disease, possible liver fail-ure, and the eventual need for transplant. Chronic carrierstates develop in more than 80% of patients, and chronicliver disease is a major problem. As many as 20% ofpatients with chronic hepatitis C will develop liver fail-ure or liver cancer . HCV is spread through sexual con-\ntact, as well as through sharing drug needles, althoughnearly half of infections can’t be traced as to origin.\nHepatitis C is detected by HCV serology (tests on\nblood sera). A specific type of assay called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to\ndetect antibody to hepatitis C for diagnostic purposes, aswell as for screening blood donors. Most cases of post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis are caused by HCV ,but application of this test has virtually eliminated post-transfusion hepatitis. An HCV viral titer to detect HCVRNA in the blood is now available, and recently, IgManti-HCV core is proving to be a useful acute marker forHCV infection.\nHepatitis D\nAlso called delta hepatitis, this is caused by the\nhepatitis D virus (HDV). The disease occurs only inthose who have HBV in the blood from a past or simulta-neously occurring infection. Experts believe transmis-sion may occur through sexual contact, but furtherresearch is needed to confirm that. Most cases occuramong those who are frequently exposed to blood andblood products. Many cases also occur among drug userswho share contaminated needles. Hepatitis D virus(HDV) antigen can be detected by radioimmunoassaywithin a few days after infection, together with IgM andtotal antibodies to HDV .\nHepatitis E\nCaused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), this is actual-\nly another type of non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus ismost often spread through fecally contaminated water,but the role of person-to-person transmission is unclear.This form of hepatitis is quite rare in the United States.There are currently no antigen or antibody tests widelyavailable to accurately detect HEV .\nPreparation\nHepatitis virus tests require a blood sample. It is not\nnecessary for the patient to withhold food or fluidsbefore any of these tests, unless requested to do so by thephysician.\nRisks\nRisks for these tests are minimal for the patient, but\nmay include slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,fainting or feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or\nhematoma (blood accumulating under the puncture site).\nNormal results\nReference ranges for the antigen/antibody tests are\nas follows:\n• hepatitis A antibody, IgM: Negative\n• hepatitis B core antibody: Negative\n• hepatitis B e antibody: Negative\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1611Hepatitis virus tests• hepatitis B e-antigen: Negative\n• hepatitis B surface antibody: Varies with clinical cir-\ncumstance (Note: As the presence of anti-HBs indicatespast infection with resolution of previous hepatitis Binfection, or vaccination against hepatitis B, additional\npatient history may be necessary for diagnosis.)\n• hepatitis B surface antigen: Negative• hepatitis C serology: Negative\n• hepatitis D serology: Negative.\nAbnormal results\nHepatitis A: A single positive anti-HA V test may\nindicate previous exposure to the virus, but due to theantibody persisting so long in the bloodstream, only evi-dence of a rising anti-HA V titer confirms hepatitis A.Determining recent infection rests on identifying theantibody as IgM (associated with recent infection). Anegative anti-HA V test rules out hepatitis A.\nHepatitis B: High levels of HBsAg that continue for\nthree or more months after onset of acute infection sug-gest development of chronic hepatitis or carrier status.Detection of anti-HBs signals late convalescence orrecovery from infection. This antibody remains in theblood to provide immunity to reinfection.\nHepatitis C (non-A, non-B hepatitis): Anti-HBc\ndevelops after exposure to hepatitis B. As an early indi-cator of acute infection, antibody (IgM) to core antigen(anti-HBc IgM) is rarely detected in chronic infection, soit is useful in distinguishing acute from chronic infection,and hepatitis B from non-A, non-B.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

    "content": "Chinese\nDefinition\nChinese herbalism is one of the major components of\ntraditional Chinese medicine (TCM), or Oriental medi-\ncine (OM). In TCM, herbs are often used in conjunctionwith other techniques, such as acupuncture or massage.\nChinese herbalism is a holistic medical system, meaningthat it looks at treating a patient as a whole person, lookingat the mental and spiritual health, as well as the physicalhealth, of the individual. Illness is seen as a disharmony orimbalance among these aspects of the individual. Chineseherbalism has been practiced for over 4,000 years.\nOne of the earliest and certainly the most important\nChinese herbal text is the Huang Ti Nei Ching , or Yellow\nEmperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine. It is believed to\nbe authored by Huang Ti during his reign over China,which started about 2697 B.C. Since that time, herbalpractices have been more extensively documented andrefined. In modern China, traditional Chinese herbalismis taught alongside conventional Western pharmacology.Chinese herbal remedies have been used in the West onlyrelatively recently, over the past two decades. Theseremedies are more gentle and natural that conventionalmedicines. In addition, they have fewer unpleasant sideeffects. Individuals with chronic disorders in particularare increasingly drawn to the holistic aspect of Chineseherbalism and TCM in general.\nPurpose\nBecause it is a safe, inexpensive solution to health\nproblems of all kinds, Chinese herbalism is very popularin China. In recent years, herbalism has been modernizedwith the introduction of quality control. For example,herbs are subjected to absorption spectrometry to deter-mine levels of heavy metals found in some. Because theyare standardized, Chinese herbs are safer for self-treat-ment. This puts the individual, not the physician, incharge of the individual’s health; that is a basic goal ofChinese herbalism.\nChinese herbalism offers unique advice regarding what\nfoods can help and what can hinder, and an herbalist can helpan individual discover what he is allergic to. In addition, Chi-nese herbs stimulate the immune system and provide benefi-cial nutrients, aside from their role in curing illness.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1612Herbalism, traditional ChineseAt M.D. Anderson Hospital in Texas, medical\nresearch has confirmed that patients undergoingchemotherapy were shown to have an improved degree\nof immune function when they took the tonic herbastragulus ( huang qi ). (It is well known that chemothera-\npy suppresses the immune system.) Research alsoshowed that T-cell and macrophage activity and interfer-on production was increased in patients using the Chi-nese herbs ganoderma, lentinus, and polyporous, helpingthe body fight cancer cells. Agents also found in gano-\nderma were found to inhibit platelet aggregation andthrombocyte formation, which would be helpful tocounter circulation and heart problems.\nAn ingredient of ginseng was found to promote\nadrenal function, which would give the herb properties ofenhancing many hormone functions in the body.\nDescription\nOrigins\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND. Traditional Chinese\nmedicine originated in the region of eastern Asia thattoday includes China, Tibet, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan.Tribal shamans and holy men who lived as hermits in themountains of China as early as 3500 \nB.C. practiced what\nwas called the “Way of Long Life.” This regimen includ-ed a diet based on herbs and other plants; kung-fu exer-cises; and special breathing techniques that were thoughtto improve vitality and life expectancy.\nAfter the Han dynasty, the next great age of Chinese\nmedicine was under the Tang emperors, who ruled from\nA.D. 608 to 906. The first Tang emperor established\nChina’s first medical school in A.D. 629 Under the Song\n(A.D.) 960–1279 and Ming ( A.D. 1368–1644) dynasties,\nnew medical schools were established, their curriculaand qualifying examinations were standardized, and thetraditional herbal prescriptions were written down andcollected into encyclopedias. One important differencebetween the development of medicine in China and inthe West is the greater interest in the West in surgical pro-cedures and techniques.PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND: THE COSMIC AND\nNATURAL ORDER. In Taoist thought, the Tao, or univer-\nsal first principle, generated a duality of opposing princi-ples that underlie all the patterns of nature. These princi-ples, yin and yang, are mutually dependent as well aspolar opposites. They are basic concepts in traditionalChinese medicine. Yin represents everything that is cold,moist, dim, passive, slow, heavy, and moving downwardor inward; while yang represents heat, dryness, bright-ness, activity, rapidity, lightness, and upward or outwardmotion. Both forces are equally necessary in nature andin human well-being, and neither force can exist withoutthe other. The dynamic interaction of these two princi-ples is reflected in the cycles of the seasons, the humanlife cycle, and other natural phenomena. One objective oftraditional Chinese medicine is to keep yin and yang inharmonious balance within a person.\nIn addition to yin and yang, Taoist teachers also\nbelieved that the Tao produced a third force, primordialenergy or qi (also spelled chi or ki). The interplaybetween yin, yang, and qi gave rise to the Five Elementsof water, metal, earth, wood, and fire. These entities areall reflected in the structure and functioning of thehuman body.\nTHE HUMAN BEING. Traditional Chinese physicians\ndid not learn about the structures of the human bodyfrom dissection because they thought that cutting open abody insulted the person’s ancestors. Instead they builtup an understanding of the location and functions of themajor organs over centuries of observation, and then cor-related them with the principles of yin, yang, qi, and theFive Elements. Thus wood is related to the liver (yin) andthe gall bladder (yang); fire to the heart (yin) and thesmall intestine (yang); earth to the spleen (yin) and thestomach (yang); metal to the lungs (yin) and the largeintestine (yang); and water to the kidneys (yin) and thebladder (yang). The Chinese also believed that the bodycontains Five Essential Substances, which include blood,spirit, vital essence (a principle of growth and develop-ment produced by the body from qi and blood), Fluids(all body fluids other than blood, such as saliva, spinalfluid, sweat, etc.), and qi.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1613Herbalism, traditional Chinese\nFive Popular Chinese Herbs Used In The U.S.\nHerb Purpose\nAstragalus (huang chi) Builds immune system, offsets side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments\nDon Quai (dang qui) Stimulates the production of red blood cells and bone marrow; increases cardiovascular \nendurance; regulates menstrual disorders\nGinseng (ren shen) Increases physical stamina; general tonicReishi mushroom (ling zhi) Eliminates toxins; increases physical staminaSchisandra (wu wei zu) Prevents fluid loss, e.g., excessive sweating, runny nose, incontinenceChinese herbal treatment differs from Western herbal-\nism in several respects. In Chinese practice, several differ-ent herbs may be used, according to each plant’s effect onthe individual’s qi and the Five Elements. There are manyformulas used within traditional Chinese medicine to treatcertain common imbalance patterns. These formulas canbe modified to fit specific individuals more closely.\nA traditional Chinese herbal formula typically con-\ntains four classes of ingredients, arranged in a hierarchicalorder: a chief (the principal ingredient, chosen for thepatient’s specific illness); a deputy (to reinforce thechief’s action or treat a coexisting condition); an assistant(to counteract side effects of the first two ingredients);and an envoy (to harmonize all the other ingredients andconvey them to the parts of the body that they are to treat).\nMethods of diagnosis\nA Chinese herbalist will not prescribe a particular\nherb on the strength of symptoms only, but will take intoconsideration the physical condition, emotional health,and mental state of the patient. He or she may look at thecondition of the patient’s hair, skin, and tongue, as wellas the appearance of the eyes, lips, and general complex-ion. The practitioner then listens to the sounds the bodymakes when breathing. He or she may smell the breath,body odor, or sputum in diagnosis.\nTCM practitioners take an extensive medical history\nof a patient. He or she may ask about dietary habits,lifestyle, and sleep patterns. The patient will be ques-tioned about chief medical complaints, as well as on hisor her particular emotional state and sexual practices.\nChinese herbalists employ touch as a diagnostic tool.\nThey may palpate the body or use light massage to assessthe patient’s physical health. Another chief component ofChinese medical diagnosis is pulse diagnosis, or sphyg-mology. This is a very refined art that takes practitionersyears to master. Some practitioners can detect 12 differentpulse points that correspond to the 12 major organs inChinese medicine. There are over 30 pulse qualities thatpractitioners are able to detect on each point. Thestrength, speed, quality, and rhythm of the pulse, to namea few, will be determined before a diagnosis is given.\nHerbs\nChinese herbs may be used alone or in combination.\nRelatively few are used alone for medicinal purposes.Practitioners believe that illness can be effectively treatedby combining herbs based on their various characteristicsand the patient’s overall health. Every herb has four basichealing properties: nature, taste, affinity, and effect.\nAn herb’s nature is described according to its yin or\nyang characteristics. Yang, or warming, herbs treat colddeficiencies. They are frequently used in the treatment of\nthe upper respiratory tract, skin, or extremities. Yin, orcooling, herbs, treat hot excess conditions. They are mostoften used to treat internal conditions and problems withorgans. Herbs can also be neutral in nature.\nAn herb’s taste does not refer to its flavor, but to its\neffect on qi, blood, fluids, and phlegm. Sour herbs have aconcentrating action. They are prescribed to treat bodilyexcess conditions, such as diarrhea , and concentrate qi.\nBitter herbs have an eliminating or moving downwardaction. They are used to treat coughs, constipation , and\nheart problems. Sweet or bland herbs have a harmonizingaction. They are used as restorative herbs and to treatpain . Spicy herbs have a stimulating action. They are\nprescribed to improve blood and qi circulation. Saltyherbs have a softening action. They are used to treat con-stipation and other digestion problems.\nAn herb’s affinity describes its action on a specific\nbodily organ. (Note that Chinese medicine does not havethe anatomical correlation for organ names. They corre-spond more closely to the organ’s function.) Sour herbshave an affinity for the liver and gallbladder. Bitter herbsact on the heart and small intestine. Sweet and blandherbs affect the stomach and spleen. Spicy herbs have anaffinity for lungs and large intestine, whereas salty herbsact on the kidneys and bladder.\nChinese herbs are lastly classified according to their\nspecific actions, which are divided into four effects.Herbs that dispel are used to treat an accumulation, slug-gishness, or spasm by relaxing or redistributing. Herbswith an astringent action are used to consolidate orrestrain a condition characterized by discharge or exces-sive elimination. Herbs that purge treat an obstruction or“poison” by encouraging elimination and detoxification .\nTonifying herbs nourish, support, and calm where thereis a deficiency.\nTreatment of diabetes\nThe incidence of diabetes has increased quite dra-\nmatically in recent years, especially in the United States,where in general people take less exercise , and food is\ntaken in greater quantity with a general reduction in qual-ity. This has lead to a scramble to find new solutions tothe problem, and many researchers have focused theirinterest on Chinese herbal remedies. In the search formore effective and more convenient treatments, the alka-loid berberine has come under close scrutiny for its manyuses, among them the treatment of diabetes. In trials, ratsgiven a mixture of berberine and alloxan showed lesslikelihood of incurring a rise in blood sugar. Patients suf-fering from type II diabetes who were given between 300and 600 mg of berberine daily for between one and three\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1614Herbalism, traditional Chinesemonths, showed a reduction in blood sugar levels, when\ntaken in conjunction with a controlled diet.\nTreatment of AIDS and cancer\nIndependent researchers are investigating indica-\ntions that Chinese herbalism can reduce the toxicity ofchemotherapy and other medications, in addition to stim-ulating immune responses.\nPreparations\nThose who are unfamiliar with Chinese herbs and\ntheir uses should consult a practitioner before startingany treatment. Once a remedy is prescribed, it may befound at Oriental markets or health food stores. Theremedies used in Chinese herbalism are standardized andsold prepared for use, with instructions for dosage. AChinese herbalist may prescribe herbs to be made intotea, or taken as capsules.\nPrecautions\nWhen treating a patient, the herbalist will aim to gen-\ntly “nudge” the system into shape, rather than producingany immediate reaction. A return to health, therefore, maytake time, and it is important that the patient realizes theprinciple of the treatment. Some practitioners estimatethat treatment will take a month for every year that achronic condition has existed. The advantage of the slowpace is that if there is a bad reaction to any herb, which israre, it will be mild because the treatment itself is gentle.\nAs with most naturopathic therapies, Chinese herbal\nremedies work best when taken in conjunction with ahealthy lifestyle and program of exercise.\nSide effects\nSome Chinese herbs are incompatible with certain\nprescription drugs, certain foods, or should not be takenduring pregnancy . To be certain, a Chinese herbalist\nshould be consulted.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAt present, there is renewed interest in the West in\ntraditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbalism. Ofthe 700 herbal remedies used by traditional Chinese prac-titioners, over 100 have been tested and found effective bythe standards of Western science. Several United Statesagencies, including the National Institutes of Health, theOffice of Alternative Medicine, and the Food and DrugAdministration are currently investigating Chinese herbalmedicine as well as acupuncture and Tui na massage.

    "content": "Herbalism, Western\nDefinition\nWestern herbalism is a form of the healing arts that\ndraws from herbal traditions of Europe and the Americ-as, and that emphasizes the study and use of Europeanand Native American herbs in the treatment and preven-tion of illness. Western herbalism is based on physicians’\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1615Herbalism, Westernand herbalists’ clinical experience and traditional knowl-\nedge of medicinal plant remedies preserved by oral tradi-tion and in written records over thousands of years. West-ern herbalism, like the much older system of traditional\nChinese medicine , relies on the synergistic and curative\nproperties of the plant to treat symptoms and disease andmaintain health.\nWestern herbalism is based upon pharmocognosy,\nthe study of natural products. Pharmocognosy includesthe identification, extraction methods, and applicationsof specific plant constituents responsible for specifictherapeutic actions, such as the use of digoxin from Digi-talis leaf for heart failure . These constituents are\nextracted, purified and studied in vitro, in vivo, and inclinical research. They may be concentrated to deliverstandardized, set doses. Sometimes, the natural con-stituent can be synthesized in the lab, or changed andpatented. Practitioners may choose to use fresh medici-nal plants, simple extracts, or standardized extracts.\nIn standardized extracts, a specific quantity of a con-\nstituent is called a marker compound, and it may or maynot be the active constituent(s) in the plant medicine.There are preparations with standardized active con-stituent quantities, and preparations with greater empha-sis on quality of crude plant material and traditionalpreparation methodology than on finalized total quantityof marker compounds. The preference between the twofor precision dosing is philosophical, practical and vari-able. When using plant extracts in which the active con-stituents and their cofactors are well established, or thetherapeutic and lethal dose are close, standardized prod-ucts are often preferred. When using plant extracts whoseactive constituents remain obscure, or the active con-stituents when purified produce weaker therapeuticresults or more undesirable side effects, the products pro-duced under good manufacturing processes and accord-ing to the traditional National Formulary U. S. Dispen-\nsatory or U. S. Pharmacopeia are preferred.\nPurpose\nThe benefits of botanical medicine may be subtle or\ndramatic, depending on the remedy used and the symp-tom or problem being addressed. Herbal remedies usual-ly have a much slower effect than pharmaceutical drugs.Some herbal remedies have a cumulative effect and workslowly over time to restore balance, and others are indi-cated for short-term treatment of acute symptoms. Whencompared to the pharmaceutical drugs, herbal remediesprepared from the whole plant have relatively few sideeffects. This is due to the complex chemistry and syner-gistic action of the full range of phytochemicals presentin the whole plant, and the relatively lower concentra-tions. They are generally safe when used in properly des-\nignated therapeutic dosages, and less costly than the iso-lated chemicals or synthetic prescription drugs availablefrom western pharmaceutical corporations.\nDescription\nOrigins\nOver 2,500 years ago Hippocrates wrote, “In medi-\ncine one must pay attention not to plausible theorizingbut to experience and reason together.” This Greek physi-cian and herbalist from the fourth century \nB.C. is consid-\nered the father of western medicine. He stressed theimportance of diet, water quality, climate, and socialenvironment in the development of disease. Hippocratesbelieved in treating the whole person, rather than merelyisolating and treating symptoms. He recognized theinnate capacity of the body to heal itself, and emphasizedthe importance of keen observation in the medical prac-tice. He recommended simple herbal remedies to assistthe body in restoring health.\nAncient Greek medicine around the fifth century\nB.C. was a fertile ground for contrasting philosophies and\nreligions. Greek physicians were influenced by the accu-mulated medical knowledge from Egypt, Persia, andBabylon. Medical advances flourished and practitionersand scholars were free to study and practice without reli-gious and secular constraints. In the fourth century \nB.C.,\nTheophrastus wrote the Historia Plantarum , considered\nto be the founding text in the science of botany.\nDuring the first century A.D. Dioscorides, a Greek\nphysician who traveled with the Roman legions, pro-duced five medical texts. His herbal text, known as theDe Materia Medica is considered to be among the most\ninfluential of all western herbal texts. It became a stan-dard reference for practitioners for the next 1,500 years.This influential book also included information on medi-cinal herbs and treatments that had been used for cen-turies in Indian Ayurvedic medicine . Galen of Perga-\nmon, who also lived in the first century \nA.D., was a\nRoman physician and student of anatomy and physiolo-gy. He authored a recipe book containing 130 antidotesand medicinal preparations. These elaborate mixtures,known as galenicals, sometimes included up to one hun-dred herbs and other substances. This complex approachto herbal medicine was a dramatic change from the sim-ple remedies recommended by Hippocrates andemployed by traditional folk healers. Galen developed arigid system of medicine in which the physician, with hisspecialized knowledge of complex medical formulas,was considered the ultimate authority in matters of healthcare. The Galenic system, relying on theory and scholar-ship rather than observation, persisted throughout the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1616Herbalism, WesternMiddle Ages. The galenical compounds, along with\nbloodletting, and purging, were among the drastic tech-niques practiced by the medical professionals duringthose times; however, traditional herbal healers persistedoutside the mainstream medical system.\nDuring the eighth century a medical school was estab-\nlished in Salerno, Italy, where the herbal knowledge accu-mulated by Arab physicians was preserved. The ArabianMuslims conducted extensive research on medicinal herbsfound in Europe, Persia, India, and the Far East. Arab busi-nessmen opened the first herbal pharmacies early in theninth century. The Leech Book of Bald , the work of a\nChristian monk, was compiled in the tenth century. It pre-served important medical writings that had survived fromthe work of physicians in ancient Greece and Rome.\nThe Middle Ages in Europe were a time of wide-\nspread death by plagues and pestilence. The Black\nPlague of 1348, particularly, and other health catastro-\nphes in later years, claimed so many lives that survivorsbegan to lose faith in the dominant Galenic medical sys-tem. Fortunately, the knowledge of traditional herbalmedicine had not been lost. Medieval monks who culti-vated extensive medicinal gardens on the monasterygrounds, also patiently copied the ancient herbal andmedical texts. Folk medicine as practiced in Europe bytraditional healers persisted, even though many womenherbalists were persecuted as witches and enemies of theCatholic church and their herbal arts were suppressed.\nThe growing spice trade and explorations to the New\nWorld introduced exotic plants, and a whole new realm ofbotanical medicines became available to Europeans. Fol-lowing the invention of the printing press in the fifteenthcentury, a large number of herbal texts, also simply calledherbals, became available for popular use. Among themwere the beautifully illustrated works of the Germanbotanists Otto Brunfels and Leonhard Fuchs published in1530, and the Dutch herbal of Belgian physician RembertDodoens, a popular work that was later reproduced inEnglish. In 1597, the physician and gardener John Gerardpublished one of the most famous of the English herbals,still in print today. Gerard’s herbal, known as The Herball\nor General Historie of Plantes was not an original work.\nMuch of the content was taken from the translated text ofhis Belgian predecessor Dodoens. Gerard did, however,include descriptions of some of the more than one thou-sand species of rare and exotic plants and English florafrom his own garden.\nThe correspondence of astrology with herbs was\ntaught by Arab physicians who regarded astrology as ascience helpful in the selection of medicines and in thetreatment of diseases. This approach to western herbalismwas particularly evident in the herbal texts published inthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One of the most\npopular and controversial English herbals is The English\nPhysician Enlarged published in 1653. The author,\nNicholas Culpeper, was an apothecary by trade. He alsopublished a translation of the Latin language London\nPharmacopoeia into English. Culpeper was a noncon-\nformist in loyalist England, and was determined to makemedical knowledge more accessible to the apothecaries,the tradesmen who prescribed most of the herbal reme-dies. Culpeper’s herbal was criticized by the medicalestablishment for its mix of magic and astrology withbotanical medicine, but it became one of the most popularcompendiums of botanical medicine of its day. Culpeperalso accepted the so-called “Doctrine of Signatures,”practiced by medieval monks in their medicinal gardens.This theory teaches that the appearance of plants is theclue to their curative powers. Plants were chosen for treat-ment of particular medical conditions based on their asso-ciations with the four natural elements and with a planetor sign. The place where the plant grows, its dominantphysical feature, and the smell and taste of an herb deter-mined the plant’s signature. Culpeper’s herbal is still inprint in facsimile copies, and some pharmocognosists andherbalists in the twenty-first century voice the same criti-cisms that Culpeper’s early critics did.\nEuropean colonists brought their herbal knowledge\nand plant specimens to settlements in North Americawhere they learned from the indigenous Americans howto make use of numerous nutritive and medicinal plants,native to the New World. Many European medicinalplants escaped cultivation from the early settlements andhave become naturalized throughout North America.

(Photo Researchers, Inc.\nReproduced by permission.)first record of Native American herbalism is found in the\nmanuscript of the native Mexican Indian physician, JuanBadianus published in 1552. The American Folk traditionof herbalism developed as a blend of traditional Europeanmedicine and Native American herbalism. The pioneernecessity for self-reliance contributed to the perseveranceof folk medicine well into the twentieth century.\nIn Europe in the seventeenth century, the alchemist\nParacelsus changed the direction of western medicinewith the introduction of chemical and mineral medicines.He was the son of a Swiss chemist and physician.Paracelsus began to apply chemicals, such as arsenic,mercury, sulfur, iron, and copper sulfate to treat disease.His chemical approach to the treatment of disease was aforerunner to the reliance in the twentieth century onchemical medicine as the orthodox treatment prescribedin mainstream medical practice.\nThe nineteenth and twentieth centuries brought a\nrenewed interest in the practice of western herbalism andthe development of natural therapies and health care sys-tems that ran counter to the mainstream methods of com-bating disease symptoms with synthetic pharmaceuticals.\nIn the late eighteenth century, the German physician\nSamuel Hahnemann developed a system of medicineknown as homeopathy . This approach to healing\nembraces the philosophy of “like cures like.” Homeopathyuses extremely diluted solutions of herbs, animal products,and chemicals that are believed to hold a “trace memory”or energetic imprint of the substance used. Homeopathicremedies are used to amplify the patient’s symptoms withremedies that would act to produce the same symptom in ahealthy person. Homeopathy holds that the symptoms ofillness are evidence of the body’s natural process of heal-ing and eliminating the cause of the disease.\nIn 1895, the European medical system known as\nNaturopathy was introduced to the North America. Likehomeopathy, this medical approach is based on the Hip-pocratic idea of eliminating disease by assisting thebody’s natural healing abilities. The naturopath uses non-toxic methods to assist the body’s natural healingprocesses, including nutritional supplements, herbalremedies, proper diet, and exercise to restore health.\nWestern herbalism is regaining popularity at a time\nwhen the world is assaulted by the stress of overpopula-\ntion and development that threatens the natural biodiver-sity necessary for these valuable medicinal plants to sur-vive. The American herb market is growing rapidly andincreasing numbers of individuals are choosing alterna-tive therapies over the mainstream allopathic westernmedicine. It is projected that by the year 2002 consumerswill spend more than seven billion dollars a year onherbal products. An estimated 2,400 acres of native planthabitat are lost to development every day. As much as\n29% of all plant life in North America is in danger ofextinction, including some of the most important nativemedicinal plants, according to the 1997 World Conserva-tion Union Red List of Threatened Plants.\nThough research into the efficacy and safety of tradi-\ntional herbal remedies is increasing, it has been limited bythe high costs of clinical studies and laboratory research,and by the fact that whole plants and their constituents arenot generally patentable (therefore, there is no drug profitafter market introduction). Outside the United States,herbalism has successfully combined with conventionalmedicine, and in some countries is fully integrated into thenations’ health care systems. At the beginning of the twen-ty-first century, 80% of the world’s population continuesto rely on herbal treatments. The World Health Organiza-tion, an agency of the United Nations, promotes traditionalherbal medicine for treatment of many local health prob-lems, particularly in the third world where it is affordableand already well-integrated into the cultural fabric.\nIn the United States, the re-emergence in interest in\nholistic approaches to health care is evident. Citizens aredemanding access to effective, safe, low-cost, natural medi-cine. Legislative and societal change is needed, however,before natural therapies can be fully integrated into theorthodox allopathic health care system and provide citizenswith a wide range of choices for treatment. If the currenttrend continues, U. S. citizens will benefit from a choiceamong a variety of safe and effective medical treatments.\nHerbs are generally defined as any plant or plant part\nthat may be used for medicinal, nutritional, culinary, orother beneficial purposes. The active constituents ofplants (if known) may be found in varying amounts in theroot, stem, leaf, flower, and fruit, etc. of the plant. Herbsmay be classified into many different categories. Somewestern herbalists categorize herbal remedies accordingto their strength, action, and characteristics. Categoriesmay include sedatives, stimulants, laxatives , febrifuges\n(to reduce fever ), and many others. One system of classi-\nfication is based on a principle in traditional Chinesemedicine that categorizes herbs into four classes: tonics,specifics, heroics, or cleansers and protectors. Withinthese broad classifications are the numerous medicinalactions of the whole herb which may be due to a specificchemical or combination of chemicals in the plant.\n• Tonics. Herbs in this classification are also known as\nalteratives in western herbalism. They are generallymild in their action and act slowly in the body, provid-ing gentle stimulation and nutrition to specific organs\nand systems. Tonic herbs act over time to strengthenand nourish the whole body. These herbs are generallysafe and may be used regularly, even in large quantities.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1618Herbalism, WesternThese tonic herbs are known as “superior” remedies in\ntraditional Chinese medicine. The therapeutic dose oftonic remedies is far removed from the possible toxicdose. American ginseng is an example of a tonic herb.\n• Specifics. Herbs in this classification are strong and\nspecific in their therapeutic action. They are generallyused for short periods of time in smaller dosages totreat acute conditions. Herbs classified as specifics arenot used beyond the therapeutic treatment period. Echi-\nnacea is a specific herb.\n• Heroic. These herbs offer high potency but are poten-\ntially toxic, and should not be used in self-treatment.Because the therapeutic dosage may be close to thelethal dosage, these herbs are presented cautiously andclosely monitored or avoided by trained clinicians.They should not be used continuously or without expertsupervision. Poke ( Phytolacca americana ) is an exam-\nple of a heroic remedy.\n• Cleansers and protectors. These herbs, plants, and plant\ntissues remove wastes and pollutants, while minimallyaffecting regular body processes. An example of acleanser is pectin. Pectins are the water soluble sub-stances that bind cell walls in plant tissues, and somebelieve that they help remove heavy metals and envi-ronmental toxins from the body.\nPreparations\nHerbal preparations are commercially available in a\nvariety of forms including tablets or capsules, tinctures,teas, fluid extracts, douches, washes, suppositories, driedherbs, and many other forms. The medicinal properties ofherbs are extracted from the fresh or dried plant parts by theuse of solvents appropriate to the particular herb. Alcohol,oil, water, vinegar, glycerin, and propylene glycol are someof the solvents used to extract and concentrate the medicinalproperties. Steam distillation and cold-pressing techniquesare used to extract the essential oils. The quality of anyherbal remedy and the potency of the phytochemicals foundin the herb depends greatly on the conditions of weather andsoil where the herb was grown, the timing and care in har-vesting, and the manner of preparation and storage.\nPrecautions\nHerbal remedies prepared by infusion, decoction, or\nalcohol tincture from the appropriate plant part, such asthe leaf, root, or flower are generally safe when ingestedin properly designated therapeutic dosages. However,many herbs have specific contraindications for use whencertain medical conditions are present. Not all herbalremedies may be safely administered to infants or smallchildren. Many herbs are not safe for use by pregnant orlactating women. Some herbs are toxic, even deadly, inKEY TERMS\nIn vitro —A biological reaction occurring in a lab-\noratory apparatus.\nIn vivo —Occurring in a living organism.\nPhyto-, as in phytochemical, phytomedicinal, and\nphytotherapy —Meaning, or pertaining to, a plant\nor plants.\nWildcrafting —Gathering of herbs or other natural\nmaterials.\nlarge amounts, and there is little research on the chronic\ntoxicity that may result from prolonged use. Herbalremedies are sold in the United States as dietary supple-ments and are not regulated for content or efficacy. Self-diagnosis and treatment with botanical medicinals maybe risky. A consultation with a clinical herbalist, Naturo-pathic physician, or certified clinical herbalist is prudentbefore undertaking a course of treatment.\nEssential oils are highly concentrated and should not\nbe ingested as a general rule. They should also be dilutedin water or in a non-toxic carrier oil before application tothe skin to prevent contact dermatitis or photo-sensitiza-\ntion. The toxicity of the concentrated essential oil variesdepending on the chemical constituents of the herb.\nThe American Professor of Pharmacognosy, Varro\nE. Tyler, believes that “herbal chaos” prevails in the Unit-ed States with regard to herbs and phytomedicinals. Inpart he blames the herb producers and marketers of crudeherbs and remedies for what he terms unproven hyper-bolic, poor quality control, deceptive labeling, resistanceto standardization of dosage forms, and continued sale ofherbs determined to be harmful.\nSide effects\nHerbs have a variety of complex phytochemicals\nthat act on the body as a whole or on specific organs andsystems. Some of these chemical constituents are mildand safe, even in large doses. Other herbs contain chemi-cals that act more strongly and may be toxic in largedoses or when taken continuously. Drug interactions arepossible with certain herbs when combined with certainpharmaceutical drugs. Some herbs are tonic in a smallamount and toxic in larger dosages.\nResearch and general acceptance\nWestern herbalism is experiencing a revival of popu-\nlar and professional interest. The number of training\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1619Herbalism, Westernschools and qualified herbal practitioners is growing to\nmeet the demand. Western herbalism is incorporated intothe medical practice of licensed Naturopathic doctors, whoreceive special training in clinical herbalism. Folk herbal-ists, heir to the continuing oral traditions passed from gen-eration to generation in many rural areas, as well as ama-teur, self-taught herbalists, keep the practice of botanicalmedicine alive at the grassroots level. Traditional westernherbalism relies on traditional use and materia medica,folk wisdom, and recent clinical research and advances inthe extraction processes. These advances provideincreased quality control on the concentration and potencyof the active ingredients. Western physicians, educated inallopathic medicine, typically receive no training in theuse of herbs. These doctors rely on pharmaceutical drugsfor their patients, and some cite the following reasons forcontinuing to do so: lack of standardized dosages, lack ofquality control in the preparation of herbal medicinals, andthe dearth of clinical research verifying the safety andeffectiveness of many traditional herbal remedies.\nHerbalism is widely practiced throughout Europe,\nparticularly in England, France, Italy, and Germany wherephytomedicinals are available in prescription form and asover-the-counter remedies. In Germany, plant medicinesare regulated by a special government body known as theCommission E. In the United States, however, despiteincreasing popularity, traditional herbalism is not integrat-ed into the allopathic medical system. Phytomedicinals aresold as dietary supplements rather than being adequatelyresearched and recognized as safe and effective drugs. TheDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 cir-cumvented a U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)effort to effectively remove botanicals from the market-place and implement regulations restricting sale. Massivepopular outcry against the proposed regulations on the saleof herbs and phytomedicinals resulted in this Congression-al action. In 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton, by execu-tive order, created the White House Commission on Alter-native Medicine in an effort to hold alternative medicinetherapies “to the same standard of scientific rigor as moretraditional health care interventions.” That Commission ischarged with recommending federal guidelines and legis-lation regarding the use of alternative medical therapies inthe twenty-first century.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Burton Goldberg Group.

Fructose intolerance is a dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1620Hereditary fructose intoleranceorder caused by the body’s inability to produce an\nenzyme called aldolase B (also called fructose 1-phos-phate aldolase) that is necessary for absorption of fruc-tose. The undigested fructose collects in the liver andkidneys, eventually causing liver and kidney failure. Oneperson in about 20,000 is born with this disorder. It isreported more frequently in the United States and North-ern European countries than in other parts of the world. Itoccurs with equal frequency in males and females.\nCauses and symptoms\nFructose intolerance is an inherited disorder passed\non to children through their parents’ genes. Both themother and father have the gene that causes the condition,but may not have symptoms of fructose intolerance them-selves. (This is called an autosomal recessive pattern ofinheritance.) The disorder will not be apparent until theinfant is fed formula, juice, fruits, or baby foods that con-tain fructose. Initial symptoms include vomiting, dehy-\ndration , and unexplained fever . Other symptoms include\nextreme thirst and excessive urination and sweating.There will also be a loss of appetite and a failure to grow.Tremors and seizures caused by low blood sugar can\noccur. The liver becomes swollen and the patient becomesjaundiced with yellowing of the eyes and skin. Leftuntreated, this condition can lead to coma and death .\nDiagnosis\nUrine tests can be used to detect fructose sugar in\nthe urine. Blood tests can also be used to detect hyper-\nbilirubinemia and high levels of liver enzymes in the\nblood. A liver biopsy may be performed to test for levels\nof enzymes present and to evaluate the extent of damageto the liver. A fructose-loading test where a dose of fruc-tose is given to the patient in a well-controlled hospital orclinical setting may also be used to confirm fructoseintolerance. Both the biopsy and the loading test can bevery risky, particularly in infants that are already sick.\nTreatment\nOnce diagnosed, fructose intolerance can be suc-\ncessfully treated by eliminating fructose from the diet.Patients usually respond within three to four weeks andcan make a complete recovery if fructose-containingfoods are avoided.

Hereditaryhemorrhagic telangiectasia is also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease.\nDescription\nThe term telangiectasia refers to a spot formed, usu-\nally on the skin, by a dilated capillary or terminal artery.In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia these spotsoccur because the blood vessel is fragile and bleeds easi-ly. The bleeding may appear as small, red or reddish-vio-let spots on the face, lips, inside the mouth and nose orthe tips of the fingers and toes. Other small telangiec-tasias may occur in the digestive tract.\nUnlike hemophilia , where bleeding is caused by an\nineffective clotting mechanism in the blood, bleeding inhereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is caused by frag-ile blood vessels. However, like hemophilia, bleedingmay be extensive and can occur without warning.\nCauses and symptoms\nHereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, an autosomal\ndominant inherited disorder, occurs in one in 50,000 people.\nRecurrent nosebleeds are a nearly universal symptom\nin this condition. Usually the nosebleeds begin in child-hood and become worse with age. The skin changes beginat puberty , and the condition becomes progressively\nworse until about 40 years of age, when it stabilizes.\nDiagnosis\nThe physician will look for red spots on all areas of\nthe skin, but especially on the upper half of the body, andin the mouth and nose and under the tongue.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for hereditary hemor-\nrhagic telangiectasia. The bleeding resulting from the con-dition can be stopped by applying compresses or directpressure to the area. If necessary, a laser can be used todestroy the vessel. In severe cases, the leaking artery canbe plugged or covered with a graft from normal tissue.\nPrognosis\nIn most people, recurrent bleeding results in an iron\ndeficiency. It is usually necessary to take iron supplements.KEY TERMS\nAutosomal dominant —A pattern of inheritance in\nwhich the dominant gene on any non-sex chromo-some carries the defect.\nChromosome —A threadlike structure in the cell\nwhich transmits genetic information.\nPrevention\nHereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherit-\ned disorder and cannot be prevented.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Medical Association. 515 N.

    "title": "Hernia",
    "content": "Hernia\nDefinition\nHernia is a general term used to describe a bulge or\nprotrusion of an organ through the structure or musclethat usually contains it.\nDescription\nThere are many different types of hernias. The most\nfamiliar type are those that occur in the abdomen, inwhich part of the intestines protrude through the abdomi-nal wall. This may occur in different areas and, depend-ing on the location, the hernia is given a different name.\nAn inguinal hernia appears as a bulge in the groin\nand may come and go depending on the position of theperson or their level of physical activity. It can occur with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1622Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasiaor without pain . In men, the protrusion may descend into\nthe scrotum. Inguinal hernias account for 80% of all her-nias and are more common in men.\nFemoral hernias are similar to inguinal hernias but\nappear as a bulge slightly lower. They are more commonin women due to the strain of pregnancy .\nA ventral hernia is also called an incisional hernia\nbecause it generally occurs as a bulge in the abdomen atthe site of an old surgical scar. It is caused by thinning orstretching of the scar tissue, and occurs more frequentlyin people who are obese or pregnant.\nAn umbilical hernia appears as a soft bulge at the\nnavel (umbilicus). It is caused by a weakening of the areaor an imperfect closure of the area in infants. This type ofhernia is more common in women due to pregnancy, andin Chinese and black infants. Some umbilical hernias ininfants disappear without treatment within the first year.\nA hiatal or diaphragmatic hernia is different from\nabdominal hernias in that it is not visible on the outsideof the body. With a hiatal hernia, the stomach bulgesupward through the muscle that separates the chest fromthe abdomen (the diaphragm). This type of hernia occursmore often in women than in men, and it is treated differ-ently from other types of hernias.\nCauses and symptoms\nMost hernias result from a weakness in the abdomi-\nnal wall that either develops or that an infant is bornwith (congenital). Any increase in pressure in theabdomen, such as coughing, straining, heavy lifting, orpregnancy, can be a considered causative factor in devel-oping an abdominal hernia. Obesity or recent excessive\nweight loss, as well as aging and previous surgery, are\nalso risk factors.\nMost abdominal hernias appear suddenly when the\nabdominal muscles are strained. The person may feeltenderness, a slight burning sensation, or a feeling ofheaviness in the bulge. It may be possible for the personto push the hernia back into place with gentle pressure,or the hernia may disappear by itself when the personreclines. Being able to push the hernia back is calledreducing it. On the other hand, some hernias cannot bepushed back into place, and are termed incarcerated orirreducible.\nA hiatal hernia may also be caused by obesity,\npregnancy, aging, or previous surgery. About 50% of allpeople with hiatal hernias do not have any symptoms. Ifsymptoms exist they will include heartburn , usually\n30–60 minutes following a meal. There may be somemid chest pain due to gastric acid from the stomachbeing pushed up into the esophagus. The pain andheartburn are usually worse when lying down. Frequent\nbelching and feelings of abdominal fullness may alsobe present.\nDiagnosis\nGenerally, abdominal hernias need to be seen and\nfelt to be diagnosed. Usually the hernia will increase insize with an increase in abdominal pressure, so the doc-tor may ask the person to cough while he or she feels the\narea. Once a diagnosis of an abdominal hernia is made,the doctor will usually send the person to a surgeon for aconsultation. Surgery provides the only cure for a herniathrough the abdominal wall.\nWith a hiatal hernia, the diagnosis is based on the\nsymptoms reported by the person. The doctor may thenorder tests to confirm the diagnosis. If a barium swallowis ordered, the person drinks a chalky white barium solu-tion, which will help any protrusion through thediaphragm show up on the x ray that follows. Currently, adiagnosis of hiatal hernia is more frequently made byendoscopy. This procedure is done by a gastroenterologist(a specialist in digestive diseases). During an endoscopythe person is given an intravenous sedative and a smalltube is inserted through the mouth, then into the esopha-gus and stomach where the doctor can visualize the her-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1623Hernia\nAn illustration of an epigastric (abdominal) hernia in an\nadult male.The torso is shown with its skin removed.

It is done on an outpatient basis.\nTreatment\nOnce an abdominal hernia occurs it tends to increase\nin size. Some patients with abdominal hernias wait andwatch for a while prior to choosing surgery. In thesecases, they must avoid strenuous physical activity such asheavy lifting or straining with constipation . They may\nalso wear a truss, which is a support worn like a belt tokeep a small hernia from protruding. People can tell iftheir hernia is getting worse if they develop severe con-stant pain, nausea and vomiting , or if the bulge does not\nreturn to normal when lying down or when they try togently push it back in place. In these cases they shouldconsult with their doctor immediately. But, ultimately,surgery is the treatment in almost all cases.\nThere are risks to not repairing a hernia surgically.\nLeft untreated, a hernia may become incarcerated, whichmeans it can no longer be reduced or pushed back intoplace. With an incarcerated hernia the intestines becometrapped outside the abdomen. This could lead to a block-age in the intestine. If it is severe enough it may cut offthe blood supply to the intestine and part of the intestinemight actually die.\nWhen the blood supply is cut off, the hernia is\ntermed “strangulated.” Because of the risk of tissuedeath (necrosis) and gangrene , and because the hernia\ncan block food from moving through the bowel, a stran-gulated hernia is a medical emergency requiring immedi-KEY TERMS\nEndoscopy —A diagnostic procedure in which a\ntube is inserted through the mouth, into the esoph-agus and stomach.

Treatments include:\n• avoiding reclining after meals\n• avoiding spicy foods, acidic foods, alcohol, and tobacco\n• eating small, frequent, bland meals\n• eating a high-fiber diet\nThere are also several types of medications that help\nto manage the symptoms of a hiatal hernia. Antacids are\nused to neutralize gastric acid and decrease heartburn.Drugs that reduce the amount of acid produced in thestomach (H2 blockers) are also used. This class of drugsincludes famotidine (sold under the name Pepcid), cime-tidine (Tagamet), and ranitidine (Zantac). Omeprazole(Prilosec) is not an H2 blocker, but is another drug thatsuppresses gastric acid secretion and is used for hiatalhernias.

    "title": "Hernia repair",
    "content": "Hernia repair\nDefinition\nHernia repair is a surgical procedure to return an\norgan that protrudes through a weak area of muscle to itsoriginal position.\nPurpose\nHernias occur when a weakness in the wall of the\nabdomen allows an organ, usually the intestines, to bulgeout of place. Hernias may result from a genetic predispo-sition toward this weakness. They can also be the resultof weakening the muscle through improper exercise or\npoor lifting techniques. Both children and adults get her-nias. Some are painful, while others are not.\nThere are three levels of hernias. An uncomplicated\nhernia is one where the intestines bulge into the peri-toneum (the membrane lining the abdomen), but they canstill be manipulated back into the body (although theydon’t stay in place without corrective surgery). This istermed a reducible hernia.\nIf the intestines bulge through the hernia defect and\nbecome trapped, this is called an incarcerated hernia. Ifthe blood supply to an incarcerated hernia is shut off, thehernia is called a strangulated hernia. Strangulated her-nias can result in gangrene .\nBoth incarcerated and strangulated hernias are med-\nical emergencies and require emergency surgery to cor-rect. For this reason, doctors generally recommend therepair of an uncomplicated hernia, even if it causes nodiscomfort to the patient.\nPrecautions\nHernia repair can be performed under local, region-\nal, or general anesthesia. The choice depends on the ageand health of the patient and the type of hernia. General-ly hernia repair is very safe surgery, but—as with anysurgery—the risk of complications increases if thepatient smokes, is obese, is very young or very old, usesalcohol heavily, or uses illicit drugs.\nDescription\nHernia repairs are performed in a hospital or outpa-\ntient surgical facility by a general surgeon. Depending onthe patient’s age, health, and the type of hernia, patientsmay be able to go home the same day or may remainhospitalized for up to three to five days.\nThere are two types of hernia repair. A herniorrhaphy\nis used for simpler hernias. The intestines are returned totheir proper place and the defect in the abdominal wall ismended. A hernioplasty is used for larger hernias. In thisprocedure, plastic or steel mesh is added to the abdominalwall to repair and reinforce the weak spot.\nThere are five kinds of common hernia repairs. They\nare named for the part of the body closest to the hernia,or bulge.\nFemoral hernia repair\nThis procedure repairs a hernia that occurs in the\ngroin where the thigh meets the abdomen. It is called a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1625Hernia repairfemoral hernia repair because it is near the spot where\nthe femoral artery and vein pass from the leg into thetrunk of the body. Sometimes this type of hernia creates anoticeable bulge.\nAn incision is made in the groin area. The tissues are\nseparated from the hernia sac, and the intestines arereturned to the abdomen. The area is often reinforcedwith webbing before it is sewn shut. The skin is closedwith sutures or metal clips that can be removed in aboutone week.\nInguinal hernia repair\nInguinal hernia repair closes a weakness in the\nabdominal wall that is near the inguinal canal, the spotwhere the testes descend from the body into the scrotum.This type of hernia occurs in about two percent of adultmales.\nAn incision is made in the abdomen, then the hernia\nis located and repaired. The surgeon must be alert not toinjure the spermatic cord, the testes, or the blood supplyto the testes. If the hernia is small, it is simply repaired. Ifit is large, the area is reinforced with mesh to prevent arecurrence. External skin sutures can be removed inabout a week. Patients should not resume sexual activityuntil being cleared by their doctor.\nUmbilical hernia repair\nThis procedure repairs a hernia that occurs when the\nintestines bulge through the abdomen wall near thenavel. Umbilical hernias are most common in infants.An incision is made near the navel. The hernia is\nlocated and the intestines are returned to the abdomen.The peritoneum is closed, then the large abdominal mus-cle is pulled over the weak spot in such a way as to rein-force the area. External sutures or skin clips can beremoved in about 10 days.\nIncisional hernia repair\nIncisional hernias occur most frequently at the site\nof a scar from earlier abdominal surgery. Once again, theabdomen is opened and the intestines returned to theirproper place. The area is reinforced with mesh, and theabdominal wall is reconstructed to prevent another herniafrom developing. External sutures can be removed inabout a week.\nHiatal hernia\nA hiatal hernia repair is slightly different from the\nother hernias described here, because it corrects a weak-ness or opening in the diaphragm, the muscle that sepa-rates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. Thissurgery is done to prevent the stomach from shifting upinto the chest cavity and to prevent the stomach fromspilling gastric juices into the esophagus, causing pain\nand scarring.\nAn incision is made in the abdomen or chest, and the\nhole or weakness in the diaphragm is located andrepaired. The top of the stomach is wrapped around thebottom of the esophagus, and they are sutured together tohold the stomach in place.

(Illustration by Electron-\nic Illustrators Group.)produces. External sutures can be removed in about one\nweek. This type of hernia repair often requires a longerhospital stay than the other types, although techniquesare being improved that reduce invasiveness of thesurgery and the length of the hospital stay.\nPreparation\nBefore the operation, the patient will have blood and\nurine collected for testing. X rays are taken of the affect-ed area. In a hiatal hernia, an endoscopy (a visual inspec-tion of the organs) is done.\nPatients should meet with the anesthesiologist before\nthe operation to discuss any medications or conditions thatmight affect the administration of anesthesia. Patients maybe asked to temporarily discontinue certain medications.The day of the operation, patients should not eat or drinkanything. They may be given an enema to clear the bowels.\nAftercare\nPatients should eat a clear liquid diet until the gas-\ntrointestinal tract begins functioning again. Normally thisis a short period of time. After that, they are free to eat ahealthy, well-balanced diet of their choice. They maybathe normally, using a gentle, unscented soap. Anantibiotic ointment may be prescribed for the incision.After the operation, a hard ridge will form along the inci-sion line. With time, this ridge softens and becomes lessnoticeable. Patients who remain in the hospital will haveblood drawn for follow-up studies.\nPatients should begin easy activities, such as walk-\ning, as soon as they are comfortable, but should avoidstrenuous exercise for four to six weeks, and especiallyavoid heavy lifting. Learning and practicing proper lift-ing techniques is an important part of patient educationafter the operation. Patients may be given a laxative orstool softener so that they will not strain to have bowelmovements. They should discuss with their doctor whento resume driving and sexual activity.\nRisks\nAs with any surgery, there exists the possibility of\nexcessive bleeding and infection after the surgery. Ininguinal and femoral hernia repair, a slight risk of dam-age to the testicles or their blood supply exists for malepatients.

    "title": "Herniated disk",
    "content": "Herniated disk\nDefinition\nDisk herniation is a rupture of fibrocartilagenous\nmaterial (annulus fibrosis) that surrounds the interverte-bral disk. This rupture involves the release of the disk’scenter portion containing a gelatinous substance calledthe nucleus pulposus. Pressure from the vertebrae aboveand below may cause the nucleus pulposus to be forcedoutward, placing pressure on a spinal nerve and causingconsiderable pain and damage to the nerve. This condi-\ntion most frequently occurs in the lumbar region and isalso commonly called herniated nucleus pulposus, pro-lapsed disk, ruptured intervertebral disk, or slipped disk.\nDescription\nThe spinal column is made up of 26 vertebrae that\nare joined together and permit forward and backward\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1627Herniated diskbending, side bending, and rotation of the spine. Five dis-\ntinct regions comprise the spinal column, including thecervical (neck) region, thoracic (chest) region, lumbar(low back) region, sacral and coccygeal (tailbone)region. The cervical region consists of seven vertebrae,the thoracic region includes 12 vertebrae, and the lumbarregion contains five vertebrae. The sacrum is composedof five fused vertebrae, which are connected to four fusedvertebrae forming the coccyx . Intervertebral disks lie\nbetween each adjacent vertebra.\nEach disk is composed of a gelatinous material in the\ncenter, called the nucleus pulposus, surrounded by ringsof a fiberous tissue (annulus fibrosus). In disk herniation,an intervertebral disk’s central portion herniates or slipsthrough the surrounding annulus fibrosus into the spinalcanal, putting pressure on a nerve root. Disk herniationmost commonly affects the lumbar region between thefifth lumbar vertebra and the first sacral vertebra. Howev-er, disk herniation can also occur in the cervical spine.The incidence of cervical disk herniation is most commonbetween the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. The secondmost common area for cervical disk herniation occursbetween the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae. Diskherniation is less common in the thoracic region.\nPredisposing factors associated with disk herniation\ninclude age, gender, and work environment. The peakage for occurrence of disk herniation is between 20–45years of age. Studies have shown that males are morecommonly affected than females in lumbar disk hernia-tion by a 3:2 ratio. Prolonged exposure to a bent-forwardwork posture is correlated with an increased incidence ofdisk herniation.\nThere are four classifications of disk pathology:\n• A protrusion may occur where a disk bulges without\nrupturing the annulus fibrosis.\n• The disk may prolapse where the nucleus pulposus\nmigrates to the outermost fibers of the annulus fibrosis.\n• There may be a disk extrusion, which is the case if the\nannulus fibrosis perforates and material of the nucleusmoves into the epidural space.\n• The sequestrated disk may occur as fragments from the\nannulus fibrosis and nucleus pulposus are outside thedisk proper.\nCauses and symptoms\nAny direct, forceful, and vertical pressure on the lum-\nbar disks can cause the disk to push its fluid contents intothe vertebral body. Herniated nucleus pulposus may occursuddenly from lifting, twisting, or direct injury, or it canoccur gradually from degenerative changes with episodesof intensifying symptoms. The annulus may also become\nweakened over time, allowing stretching or tearing andleading to a disk herniation. Depending on the location ofthe herniation, the herniated material can also press direct-ly on nerve roots or on the spinal cord, causing a shock-like pain ( sciatica ) down the legs, weakness, numbness, or\nproblems with bowels, bladder, or sexual function.\nDiagnosis\nSeveral radiographic tests are useful for confirming\na diagnosis of disk herniation and locating the source ofpain. These tests also help the surgeon indicate the extentof the surgery needed to fully decompress the nerve. Xrays show structural changes of the lumbar spine. Myel-\nography is a special x ray of the spine in which a dye or\nair is injected into the patient’s spinal canal. The patientlies strapped to a table as the table tilts in various direc-tions and spot x rays are taken. X rays showing a nar-rowed dye column in the intervertebral disk area indicatepossible disk herniation.\nComputed tomography scan (CT or CAT scans)\nexhibit the details of pathology necessary to obtain con-sistently good surgical results. Magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) analysis of the disks can accurately\ndetect the early stages of disk aging and degeneration.\nElectomyograms (EMGs) measure the electrical activityof the muscle contractions and possibly show evidence ofnerve damage. An EMG is a powerful tool for assessingmuscle fatigue associated with muscle impairment with\nlow back pain .\nTreatment\nDrugs\nUnless serious neurologic symptoms occur, herniated\ndisks can initially be treated with pain medication and upto 48 hours of bed rest. There is no proven benefit fromresting more than 48 hours. Patients are then encouragedto gradually increase their activity. Pain medications,including antiinflammatories, muscle relaxers, or insevere cases, narcotics, may be continued if needed.\nEpidural steroid injections have been used to\ndecrease pain by injecting an antiinflammatory drug,usually a corticosteroid, around the nerve root to reduceinflammation and edema (swelling). This partly relieves\nthe pressure on the nerve root as well as resolves theinflammation.\nPhysical therapy\nPhysical therapists are skilled in treating acute back\npain caused by the disk herniation. The physical therapist\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1628Herniated diskcan provide noninvasive therapies, such as ultrasound or\ndiathermy to project heat deep into the tissues of the backor administer manual therapy, if mobility of the spine isimpaired. They may help improve posture and developan exercise program for recovery and long-term protec-\ntion. Appropriate exercise can help take pressure offinflamed nerve structures, while improving overall pos-ture and flexibility. Traction can be used to try to\ndecrease pressure on the disk. A lumbar support can behelpful for a herniated disk at this level as a temporarymeasure to reduce pain and improve posture.\nSurgery\nSurgery is often appropriate for conditions that do\nnot improve with the usual treatment. In this event, astrong, flexible spine is important for a quick recoveryafter surgery. There are several surgical approaches totreating a herniated disk, including the classic discecto-my, microdiscectomy, or percutanteous discectomy. Thebasic differences among these procedures are the size ofthe incision, how the disk is reached surgically, and how\nmuch of the disk is removed.\nDiscectomy is the surgical removal of the portion of\nthe disk that is putting pressure on a nerve causing theback pain. In the classic disectomy, the surgeon firstenters through the skin and then removes a bony portionof the vertebra called the lamina, hence the termlaminectomy. The surgeon removes the disk material thatis pressing on a nerve. Rarely is the entire lamina or diskentirely removed. Often, only one side is removed andthe surgical procedure is termed hemi-laminectomy.\nIn microdiscectomy, through the use of an operating\nmicroscope, the surgeon removes the offending bone ordisk tissue until the nerve is free from compression orstretch. This procedure is possible using local anesthesia.Microsurgery techniques vary and have several advan-tages over the standard discectomy, such as a smallerincision, less trauma to the musculature and nerves, andeasier identification of structures by viewing into thedisk space through microscope magnification.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1629Herniated disk\nSpinal cord\nVertebra\nDiskSpinal nerve\nA herniated disk refers to the rupture of fibrocartilagenous material, called the annulus fibrosis, that surrounds the interver-\ntebral disk. When this occurs, pressure from the vertebrae above and below may force the disk’s center portion, a gel-likesubstance, outward, placing additional pressure on the spinal nerve and causing pain and damage to the nerve. (Illustration\nby Electronic Illustrators Group.)KEY TERMS\nAnnulus fibrosis —The outer portion of the interver-\ntebral disk made primarily of fibrocartilage rings.\nEpidural space —The space immediately surround-\ning the outermost membrane of the spinal cord.\nExcision —The process of excising, removing, or\namputating.\nFibrocartilage —Cartilage that consists of dense\nfibers.\nNucleus pulposus —The center portion of the\nintervertebral disk that is made up of a gelatinoussubstance.\nPercutaneous —Performed through the skin.Percutaneous disk excision is performed on an out-\npatient basis, is less expensive than other surgical proce-dures, and does not require a general anesthesia. The pur-pose of percutaneous disk excision is to reduce the vol-ume of the affected disk indirectly by partial removal ofthe nucleus pulposus, leaving all the structures importantto stability practically unaffected. In this procedure, largeincisions are avoided by inserting devices that have cut-ting and suction capability. Suction is applied and thedisk is sliced and aspirated.\nArthroscopic microdiscectomy is similar to percuta-\nneous discectomy, however it incorporates modified arthro-scopic instruments, including scopes and suction devices.A suction irrigation of saline solution is establishedthrough two entry sites. A video discoscope is introducedfrom one site and the deflecting instruments from the oppo-site side. In this way, the surgeon is able to search andextract the nuclear fragments under direct visualization.\nLaser disk decompression is performed using simi-\nlar means as percutaneous excision and arthroscopicmicrodiscectomy, however laser energy is used toremove the disk tissue. Here, laser energy is percutan-teously introduced through a needle to vaporize a smallvolume of nucleus pulposus, thereby dropping the pres-sure of the disk and decompressing the involved neuraltissues. One disadvantage of this procedure is the highinitial cost of the laser equipment. It is important to real-ize that only a very small percentage of people with her-niated lumbar disks go on to require surgery. Further,surgery should be followed by appropriate rehabilita-\ntion to decrease the chance of reinjury.\nChemonucleolysis\nChemonucleolysis is an alternative to surgical exci-\nsion. Chymopapain, a purified enzyme derived from thepapaya plant, is injected percutaneously into the diskspace to reduce the size of the herniated disks. It hydrol-yses proteins, thereby decreasing water-binding capacity,when injected into the nucleus pulposus inner disk mate-rial. The reduction in size of the disk relieves pressure onthe nerve root.\nSpinal fusion\nSpinal fusion is the process by which bone grafts\nharvested from the iliac crest (thick border of the iliumlocated on the pelvis) are placed between the interverte-bral bodies after the disk material is removed. Thisapproach is used when there is a need to reestablish thenormal bony relationship between the vertebrae. A totaldiscectomy may be needed in some cases because lum-bar spinal fusion can help prevent recurrent lumbar diskherniation at a particular level.Alternative treatment\nAcupuncture involves the use of fine needles inserted\nalong the pathway of the pain to move energy locally andrelieve the pain. An acupuncturist determines the locationof the nerves affected by the herniated disk and positionsthe needles appropriately. Massage therapists may also pro-vide short-term relief from a herniated disk. Followingmanual examination and x-ray diagnosis, chiropractic\ntreatment usually includes manipulation to correct muscleand joint malfunctions, while care is taken not to place anadditional strain on the injured disk. If a full trial of conser-vative therapy fails, or if neurologic problems (weakness,bowel or bladder problems, and sensory loss) develop, thenext step is usually evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon.\nPrognosis\nOnly 5–10% of patients with unrelenting sciatica\nand neurological involvement, leading to chronic pain ofthe lumbar spine, need to have a surgical procedure per-formed. This strongly suggests that many patients withherniated disks at the lumbar level respond well to con-servative treatment. For those patients who do requiresurgery for lumbar disk herniation, the reviewed proce-dures of nerve root decompression caused by disk herni-ation is favorable. Results of studies varied from 60–90%success rates. Disk surgery has progressively evolved inthe direction of decreasing invasiveness. Each surgicalprocedure is not without possible complications, whichcan lead to chronic low back pain and restricted lifestyle.\nPrevention\nProper exercises to strengthen the lower back and\nabdominal muscles are key in preventing excess stress\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1630Herniated diskand compressive forces on lumbar disks.

    "title": "Hiccups",
    "content": "Hiccups\nDefinition\nHiccups are the result of an involuntary, spasmodic\ncontraction of the diaphragm followed by the closing ofthe throat.\nDescription\nHiccups are one of the most common, but thankfully\nmildest, disorders to which humans are prey. Virtuallyeveryone experiences them at some point, but they rarelylast long or require a doctor’s care. Occasionally, a boutof hiccups will last longer than two days, earning it thename “persistent hiccups.” Very few people will experi-ence intractable hiccups, in which hiccups last longerthan one month.\nA hiccup involves the coordinated action of the\ndiaphragm and the muscles that close off the windpipe(trachea). The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle sepa-rating the chest and abdomen, normally responsible forexpanding the chest cavity for inhalation. Sensation fromthe diaphragm travels to the spinal cord through thephrenic nerve and the vagus nerve, which pass throughthe chest cavity and the neck. Within the spinal cord,nerve fibers from the brain monitor sensory informationand adjust the outgoing messages that control contrac-tion. These messages travel along the phrenic nerve.\nIrritation of any of the nerves involved in this loop\ncan cause the diaphragm to undergo involuntary contrac-tion, or spasm, pulling air into the lungs. When thisoccurs, it triggers a reflex in the throat muscles. Lessthan a tenth of a second afterward, the trachea is closedoff, making the characteristic “hic” sound.\nCauses and symptoms\nHiccups can be caused by central nervous system\ndisorders, injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagusnerves, and toxic or metabolic disorders affecting thecentral or peripheral nervous systems. They may be ofunknown cause or may be a symptom of psychologicalstress . Hiccups often occur after drinking carbonated\nbeverages or alcohol. They may also follow overeating orrapid temperature changes. Persistent or intractable hic-cups may be caused by any condition which irritates ordamages the relevant nerves, including:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1631Hiccups• overstretching of the neck\n• laryngitis\n• heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux)\n• irritation of the eardrum (which is innervated by the\nvagus nerve)\n• general anesthesia\n• surgery• bloating\n• tumor\n• infection\n• diabetes\nDiagnosis\nHiccups are diagnosed by observation, and by hear-\ning the characteristic sound. Diagnosing the cause ofintractable hiccups may require imaging studies, bloodtests, pH monitoring in the esophagus, and other tests.\nTreatment\nMost cases of hiccups will disappear on their own.\nHome remedies which interrupt or override the spasmodicnerve circuitry are often effective. Such remedies include:\n• holding one’s breath for as long as possible\n• breathing into a paper bag\n• swallowing a spoonful of sugar\n• bending forward from the waist and drinking water\nfrom the wrong side of a glass\nTreating any underlying disorder will usually cure the\nassociated hiccups. Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) relievesintractable hiccups in 80% of cases. Metoclopramide(Reglan), carbamazepam, valproic acid (Depakene), andphenobarbital are also used. As a last resort, surgery toblock the phrenic nerve may be performed, although itmay lead to significant impairment of respiration.\nPrognosis\nMost cases of hiccups last no longer than several\nhours, with or without treatment.\nPrevention\nSome cases of hiccups can be avoided by drinking in\nmoderation, avoiding very hot or very cold food, andavoiding cold showers. Carbonated beverages whendrunk through a straw deliver more gas to the stomachthan when sipped from a container; therefore, avoidusing straws.KEY TERMS\nNerve —Fibers that carry sensory information,\nmovement stimuli, or both from the brain andspinal cord to other parts of the body and backagain.

    "content": "High-risk pregnancy\nDefinition\nA high risk pregnancy is one in which some condi-\ntion puts the mother, the developing fetus, or both athigher-than-normal risk for complications during or afterthe pregnancy and birth.\nDescription\nA pregnancy can be considered a high-risk pregnan-\ncy for a variety of reasons. Factors can be divided intomaternal and fetal. Maternal factors include age (youngerthan age 15, older than age 35); weight (pre-pregnancyweight under 100 lb or obesity ); height (under five feet);\nhistory of complications during previous pregnancies(including stillbirth , fetal loss, preterm labor and/or\ndeliver small-for-gestational age baby, large baby, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia); more than five previous preg-nancies; bleeding during the third trimester; abnormalitiesof the reproductive tract; uterine fibroids ; hypertension ;\nRh incompatability; gestational diabetes ; infections of\nthe vagina and/or cervix; kidney infection; fever ; acute\nsurgical emergency ( appendicitis , gallbladder disease,\nbowel obstruction); post-term pregnancy; pre-existingchronic illness (such as asthma , autoimmune disease,\ncancer , sickle cell anemia, tuberculosis , herpes, AIDS ,\nheart disease, kidney disease, Crohn’s disease ,ulcera-\ntive colitis , diabetes). Fetal factors include exposure to\ninfection (especially herpes simplex, viral hepatitis,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1632High-risk pregnancymumps ,rubella , varicella, syphilis ,toxoplasmosis , and\ninfections caused by coxsackievirus); exposure to damag-ing medications (especially phenytoin, folic acid antago-\nnists, lithium, streptomycin, tetracycline, thalidomide,and warfarin); exposure to addictive substances (cigarettesmoking , alcohol intake, and illicit or abused drugs). A\npregnancy is also considered high-risk when prenataltests indicate that the baby has a serious health problem(for example, a heart defect). In such cases, the motherwill need special tests, and possibly medication, to carrythe baby safely through to delivery. Furthermore, certainmaternal or fetal problems may prompt a physician todeliver a baby early, or to choose a surgical delivery(cesarean section) rather than a vaginal delivery.\nMost women will see one healthcare provider during\npregnancy, either an obstetrician, a midwife, or a nursepractitioner. Women who have a medical problem mayneed to see a medical specialist as well. Women diag-nosed with a high-risk pregnancy may also need theexpert advice and care of a perinatologist. A perinatolo-gist is a medical doctor (obstetrician) who specializes inthe care of women who are at high risk for having prob-lems during pregnancy. Perinatologists care for womenwho have pre-existing medical problems as well aswomen who develop complications during pregnancy.\nDiagnosis\nA woman with a high-risk pregnancy will need clos-\ner monitoring than the average pregnant woman. Suchmonitoring may include more frequent visits with theprimary caregiver, tests to monitor the medical problem,blood tests to check the levels of medication, amniocen-\ntesis , serial ultrasound examination, and fetal monitor-\ning. These tests are designed to track the original condi-tion, survey for complications, verify that the fetus isgrowing adequately, and make decisions regardingwhether labor may need to be induced to allow for earlydelivery of the fetus.\nTreatment\nTreatment varies widely with the type of disease, the\neffect that pregnancy has on the disease, and the effectthat the disease has on pregnancy. Additional tests mayhelp determine the need for changes in medication oradditional treatment.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends in large part on the specific\nmedical condition. Some medical conditions make it dif-ficult to get pregnant and lead to a higher risk of prob-lems in the baby. An example of this type of condition isthyroid disease. In thyroid disease, the thyroid gland\n(located in the neck) may produce too much or too littlethyroid hormone. Abnormal levels of thyroid hormonecan cause problems in pregnancy and affect the health ofthe baby. Fortunately, thyroid disease can be treated withmedication. As long as the level of thyroid hormone iscontrolled throughout pregnancy, there should be noproblems for mother or baby.\nThere are many medical conditions that usually do\nnot interfere with pregnancy, but are themselves affectedby pregnancy. This group includes asthma, epilepsy, andulcerative colitis. For example, some women with ulcera-tive colitis experience a worsening of their symptoms dur-ing pregnancy, while others will have no change or mayget better during pregnancy. The same is true of asthma;some women notice that their asthma symptoms are betterduring pregnancy, some find their asthma worse, andsome women notice no change in symptoms during preg-nancy. No one understands why this is so, but due to thisunpredictability, all women with chronic illnesses shouldbe monitored carefully throughout pregnancy.\nThere is also a group of medical conditions that can\nhave a major impact on pregnancy. Women with lupus(disease caused by alterations in the immune system thatresult in inflammation of connective tissue and organs)or kidney disease face real risks during pregnancy. Preg-nancy can cause their symptoms to worsen significantlyand can lead to serious illness. Because these diseasescan affect the mother’s ability to supply oxygen andnutrients to the baby through the placenta, they can causeproblems for the baby as well. These babies may not beable to grow and gain weight properly ( intrauterine\ngrowth retardation ). There is also an increased risk of\nstillbirth.\nDiabetes is a medical condition that is both affected\nby pregnancy and affects pregnancy. Diabetes can lead tomiscarriages, birth defects , and stillbirths. When a\nwoman monitors her blood sugar carefully and treatshigh levels with insulin, the risk of these negative out-comes drops a great deal. Unfortunately, pregnancymakes diabetes much harder to control. In general, bloodsugar and the need for insulin to control it rise through-out pregnancy.\nMost medical conditions do not lead to complications\nin pregnancy. With frequent visits to healthcare providers,and careful attention to medication, women with medicalproblems usually enjoy healthy, successful pregnancies.There are a few medical conditions that can cause healthrisks to both mother and baby during pregnancy. Womenwith these medical problems should consider these risksbefore deciding to become pregnant. Many of thesewomen will benefit from the care of a perinatologist dur-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1633High-risk pregnancying pregnancy. Only rarely (in the case of severe heart dis-\nease, for example) are the risks to the mother so high thatshe should not consider pregnancy at all.\nPrevention\nA pre-pregnancy visit with a healthcare provider is\nespecially important for a woman who has a medicalproblem. The doctor will discuss how women with thiscondition usually fare during pregnancy. For some dis-eases (such as lupus), pregnancy can mean increased riskof health problems for mother and baby.\nSometimes, the medication a woman needs to con-\ntrol a medical condition can cause problems for the baby.There may be another medication available that is saferfor use in pregnancy. In some cases there is no othermedication, and a woman must weigh the risks to thebaby when deciding whether or not to become pregnant.\nA woman who has not had a pre-pregnancy visit\nshould contact a healthcare provider as soon as she learnsshe is pregnant. Often, the provider will schedule the firstprenatal visit within a day or two, instead of waiting untileight to 10 weeks of pregnancy. This is because certainmedical conditions can increase the risk of miscarriage .\nThe provider will want to be sure that any medication isadjusted properly to increase the chance of having a suc-cessful pregnancy.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“High-Risk Pregnancies.” In The Merck Manual of Diagnosis\nand Therapy, edited by Mark H.

In upto 10% of children, however, the entire colon and part ofthe small intestine are involved.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1634Hirschsprung’s diseaseHirschprung’s disease occurs once in every 5,000\nlive births, and it is about four times more common inmales than females. Between 4% and 50% of siblings arealso afflicted. The wide range for recurrence is due to thefact that the recurrence risk depends on the gender of theaffected individual in the family (i.e., if a female isaffected, the recurrence risk is higher) and the length ofthe aganglionic segment of the colon (i.e., the longer thesegment that is affected, the higher the recurrence risk).\nCauses and symptoms\nHirschsprung’s disease occurs early in fetal develop-\nment when, for unknown reasons, there is either failure ofnerve cell development, failure of nerve cell migration, orarrest in nerve cell development in a segment of bowel.The absence of these nerve fibers, which help control themovement of bowel contents, is what results in intestinalobstruction accompanied by other symptoms.\nThere is a genetic basis to Hirschsprung’s disease,\nand it is believed that it may be caused by differentgenetic factors in different subsets of families. Proof thatgenetic factors contribute to Hirschprung’s disease is thatit is known to run in families, and it has been seen inassociation with some chromosome abnormalities. Forexample, about 10% of children with the disease haveDown syndrome (the most common chromosome\nabnormality). Molecular diagnostic techniques haveidentified many genes that cause susceptibility to Hirsch-prung’s disease. As of 200l, there are a total of six genes:the RET gene, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophicfactor gene, the endothelin-B receptor gene, endothelinconverting enzyme, the endothelin-3 gene, and the Sry-related transcription factor SOX10. Mutations that inacti-vate the RET gene are the most frequent, occurring in50% of familial cases (cases which run in families) and15-20% of sporadic (non-familial) cases. Mutations inthese genes do not cause the disease, but they make thechance of developing it more likely. Mutations in othergenes or environmental factors are required to developthe disease, and these other factors are not understood.\nFor persons with a ganglion growth beyond the sig-\nmoid segment of the colon, the inheritance pattern isautosomal dominant with reduced penetrance (risk closerto 50%). For persons with smaller segments involved, theinheritance pattern is multifactorial (caused by an inter-action of more than one gene and environmental factors,risk lower than 50%) or autosomal recessive (one diseasegene inherited from each parent, risk closer to 25%) withlow penetrance.\nThe initial symptom is usually severe, continuous\nconstipation . A newborn may fail to pass meconium (the\nfirst stool) within 24 hours of birth, may repeatedlyvomit yellow or green colored bile and may have a dis-\ntended (swollen, uncomfortable) abdomen. Occasionally,infants may have only mild or intermittent constipation,often with diarrhea .\nWhile two-thirds of cases are diagnosed in the first\nthree months of life, Hirschsprung’s disease may also bediagnosed later in infancy or childhood. Occasionally,even adults are diagnosed with a variation of the disease.In older infants, symptoms and signs may includeanorexia (lack of appetite or inability to eat), lack of theurge to move the bowels or empty the rectum on physi-\ncal examination , distended abdomen, and a mass in the\ncolon that can be felt by the physician during examina-tion. It should be suspected in older children with abnor-mal bowel habits, especially a history of constipationdating back to infancy and ribbon-like stools.\nOccasionally, the presenting symptom may be a\nsevere intestinal infection called enterocolitis, which islife threatening. The symptoms are usually explosive,watery stools and fever in a very ill-appearing infant. It\nis important to diagnose the condition before the intesti-nal obstruction causes an overgrowth of bacteria thatevolves into a medical emergency. Enterocolitis can leadto severe diarrhea and massive fluid loss, which cancause death from dehydration unless surgery is done\nimmediately to relieve the obstruction.\nDiagnosis\nHirschsprung’s disease in the newborn must be dis-\ntinguished from other causes of intestinal obstruction.The diagnosis is suspected by the child’s medical historyand physical examination, especially the rectal exam.The diagnosis is confirmed by a barium enema x ray,\nwhich shows a picture of the bowel. The x ray will indi-cate if a segment of bowel is constricted, causing dilationand obstruction. A biopsy of rectal tissue will reveal theabsence of the nerve fibers. Adults may also undergomanometry, a balloon study (device used to enlarge theanus for the procedure) of internal anal sphincter pres-sure and relaxation.\nTreatment\nHirschsprung’s disease is treated surgically. The\ngoal is to remove the diseased, nonfunctioning segmentof the bowel and restore bowel function. This is oftendone in two stages. The first stage relieves the intestinalobstruction by performing a colostomy . This is the cre-\nation of an opening in the abdomen (stoma) throughwhich bowel contents can be discharged into a wastebag. When the child’s weight, age, or condition isdeemed appropriate, surgeons close the stoma, remove\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1635Hirschsprung’s diseasethe diseased portion of bowel, and perform a “pull-\nthrough” procedure, which repairs the colon by connect-ing functional bowel to the anus. This usually establishesfairly normal bowel function.\nPrognosis\nOverall, prognosis is very good. Most infants with\nHirschsprung’s disease achieve good bowel control aftersurgery, but a small percentage of children may have lin-gering problems with soilage or constipation. Theseinfants are also at higher risk for an overgrowth of bacte-ria in the intestines, including subsequent episodes ofenterocolitis, and should be closely followed by a physi-cian. Mortality from enterocolitis or surgical complica-tions in infancy is 20%.\nPrevention\nHirschsprung’s disease is a congenital abnormality\nthat has no known means of prevention.

    "content": "Hirsutism\nDefinition\nExcessive growth of facial or body hair in women is\ncalled hirsutism.\nDescription\nHirsutism is not a disease. The condition usually\ndevelops during puberty and becomes more pronounced\nas the years go by. However, an inherited tendency, over-production of male hormones (androgens), medication,or disease, can cause it to appear at any age.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1636HirsutismWomen who have hirsutism usually have irregular\nmenstrual cycles. They sometimes have small breasts anddeep voices, and their muscles and genitals may becomelarger than women without the condition.\nTypes of hirsutism\nIdiopathic hirsutism is probably hereditary, because\nthere is usually a family history of the disorder. Womenwith idiopathic hirsutism have normal menstrual cyclesand no evidence of any of the conditions associated withsecondary hirsutism.\nSecondary hirsutism is most often associated with\npolycystic ovary syndrome (an inherited hormonal dis-\norder characterized by menstrual irregularities, biochem-ical abnormalities, and obesity ). This type of hirsutism\nmay also be caused by:\n• malfunctions of the pituitary or adrenal glands\n• use of male hormones or minoxidil (Loniten), a drug\nused to widen blood vessels\n• adrenal or ovarian tumors\nCauses and symptoms\nHirsutism is rarely caused by a serious underlying\ndisorder. Pregnancy occasionally stimulates its develop-\nment. Hirsutism triggered by tumors is very unusual.\nHair follicles usually become enlarged, and the hairs\nthemselves become larger and darker. A woman whosehirsutism is caused by an increase in male hormones hasa pattern of hair growth similar to that of a man. Awoman whose hirsutism is not hormone-related has long,fine hairs on her face, arms, chest, and back.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on a family history of hirsutism,\na personal history of menstrual irregularities, and mascu-line traits. Laboratory tests are not needed to assess thestatus of patients whose menstrual cycles are normal andwho have mild, gradually progressing hirsutism.\nA family physician or endocrinologist may order\nblood tests to measure hormone levels in women withlong-standing menstrual problems or more severe hir-sutism.

    "title": "Histiocytosis X",
    "content": "Histiocytosis X\nDefinition\nHistiocytosis X is a generic term that refers to an\nincrease in the number of histiocytes, a type of whiteblood cell, that act as scavengers to remove foreign materi-al from the blood and tissues. Since recent researchdemonstrated Langerhan cell involvement as well as histi-ocytes, this led to a proposal that the term Langerhans CellHistiocytosis (LCH) be used in place of histiocytosis X.Either term refers to three separate illnesses (listed in orderof increasing severity): eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schuller-Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe disease.\nDescription\nEpidermal (skin) Langerhans cells (a form of den-\ndritic cell) accumulate with other immune cells in vari-ous parts of the body and cause damage by the release ofchemicals. Normally, Langerhans cells recognize foreignmaterial, including bacteria, and stimulate the immunesystem to react to them. Langerhans cells are usuallyfound in skin, lymph nodes, lungs, and the gastrointesti-nal tract. Under abnormal conditions these cells affectskin, bone, and the pituitary gland as well as the lungs,intestines, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and brain. There-fore, the disease is not confined to areas where Langer-hans cells are normally found. The disease is more com-mon in children than adults and tends to be most severein very young children.\nHistiocytosis X or LCH is a family of related condi-\ntions characterized by a distinct inflammatory and pro-liferative process but differs from each other in whichparts of the body are involved. The least severe of thehistiocytosis X/LCH family is eosinophilic granuloma.Approximately 60–80% of all diagnosed cases are inthis classification, which usually occurs in children agedfive to 10 years. The bones are involved 50–75% of thetime, which includes the skull, or mandible, and the longbones. If the bone marrow is involved, anemia canresult. With skull involvement, growths can occurbehind the eyes, bulging them forward. The lungs areinvolved less than 10% of the time, and this involvementsignals the worst prognosis.\nNext in severity is Hand-Schuller-Christian disease, a\nchronic, scattered form of histiocytosis. It occurs most\ncommonly from the age of one to three years and is aslowly progressive disease that affects the softened areasof the skull, other flat bones, the eyes, and skin. Letterer-Siwe disease is the acute form of this series of diseases. Itis generally found from the time of birth to one year ofage. It causes an enlarged liver, bruising and skin lesions ,\nanemia, enlarged lymph glands, other organ involvement,and extensive skull lesions.\nCauses and symptoms\nThis is a rare disorder affecting approximately 1 in\n200,000 children or adults each year. Because it is so rare,little research has been done to determine the cause. Overtime, it may lessen in its assault on the body but there arestill problems from damage to the tissues. There are noapparent inheritance patterns in these diseases with theexception of a form involving the lymphatic system.\nThe symptoms of histiocytosis are caused by sub-\nstances called cytokines and prostaglandins, which are nor-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1638Histiocytosis Xmally produced by histiocytes and act as messengers\nbetween cells. When these chemicals are produced in excessamounts and in the wrong places, they cause tissue swellingand abnormal growth. Thus, symptoms may include painfullumps in the skull and limbs as well as rashes on the skin.\nGeneral symptoms may include: poor appetite, failure togain weight, recurrent fever , and irritability. Symptoms\nfrom other possible sites of involvement include:\n• gums: Swelling, usually without significant discomfort\n• ear: Chronic discharge\n• liver or spleen: Abdominal discomfort or swelling• pituitary: This gland at the base of the brain is affected\nat some stage in approximately 20%–30% of childrencausing a disturbance in water balance to produce thirstand frequent urination.\n• eyes: Due to the bony disease, behind-the-eye bulging\nmay occur (exophthalmos)\n• lungs: Breathing problems\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis can only be made by performing a\nbiopsy, that is, taking a tissue sample under anesthesiafrom a site in the patient thought to be involved. Bloodand urine tests, chest and other x rays, magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography\nscans (CAT scans) (to check the extent of involvement),\nand possibly bone marrow or breathing tests may berequired to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nAlthough this disease is not cancer , most patients are\ntreated in cancer clinics. There are two reasons for this:\n• Historically, cancer specialists treated it before the cause\nwas known.\n• The treatment requires the use of drugs typically re-\nquired to treat cancer.\nAny cancer drugs utilized are usually given in small-\ner doses, which diminishes the severity of their sideeffects. Radiation therapy is rarely used, and special\ndrugs may be prescribed for skin symptoms. If there isonly one organ affected, steroids may be injected locally,or a drug called indomethacin may be used. Indomethacinis an anti-inflammatory medication that may achieve asimilar response with less severe side effects.\nPrognosis\nThe disease fluctuates markedly. If only one system\nis involved, the disease often resolves by itself. Multisys-tem disease usually needs treatment although it may dis-\nappear spontaneously. The disease is not normally fatalunless organs vital to life are damaged. In general, theyounger the child at diagnosis and the more organsinvolved, the poorer the outlook. If the condition resolves,there could still be long-term complications because ofthe damage done while the disease was active.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBehrman, Richard E., Robert Kliegman, and Hal B.

    "title": "Histoplasmosis",
    "content": "Histoplasmosis\nDefinition\nHistoplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by\ninhaling the microscopic spores of the fungus Histoplas-\nma capsulatum . The disease exists in three forms. Acute\nor primary histoplasmosis causes flu-like symptoms.Most people who are infected recover without medicalintervention. Chronic histoplasmosis affects the lungsand can be fatal. Disseminated histoplasmosis affectsmany organ systems in the body and is often fatal, espe-cially to people with acquired immunodeficiency syn-\ndrome ( AIDS ).\nDescription\nHistoplasmosis is an airborne infection. The spores\nthat cause this disease are found in soil that has been con-taminated with bird or bat droppings. In the United\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1639HistoplasmosisStates, the disease is most common in eastern and mid-\nwestern states and is widespread in the upper Mississip-pi, Ohio, Missouri, and St. Lawrence river valleys.Sometimes histoplasmosis is called Ohio Valley disease,Central Mississippi River Valley disease, AppalachianMountain disease, Darling’s disease, or Histoplasma\ncapsulatum infection.\nAnyone can get histoplasmosis, but people who\ncome in contact with bird and bat excrement are morelikely to be infected. This includes farmers, gardeners,bridge inspectors and painters, roofers, chimney cleaners,demolition and construction workers, people installing orservicing heating and air conditioning units, peoplerestoring old or abandoned buildings, and people whoexplore caves.\nThe very young and the elderly, especially if they\nhave a pre-existing lung disease or are heavy smokers,are more likely to develop symptoms that are moresevere. People who have a weakened immune system,either from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as theresult of medications they take ( corticosteroids ,\nchemotherapy drugs), are more likely to develop chron-\nic or disseminated histoplasmosis.Causes and symptoms\nWhen the spores of H. capsulatum are inhaled, they\nlodge in the lungs where they divide and cause lesions.This is known as acute or primary histoplasmosis. It isnot contagious.\nMany otherwise healthy people show no symptoms\nof infection at all. When symptoms do occur, they appear3–17 days after exposure (average time is 10 days). Thesymptoms are usually mild and resemble those of a coldor flu; fever , dry cough , enlarged lymph glands, tired-\nness, and a general feeling of ill health. A small numberof people develop bronchopneumonia. About 95% ofpeople who are infected either experience no symptomsor have symptoms that clear up spontaneously. Thesepeople then have partial immunity to re-infection.\nIn some people, the spores that cause the disease con-\ntinue to live in the lungs. In about 5% of people who areinfected, usually those with chronic lung disease, diabetesmellitis, or weakened immune systems, the disease pro-gresses to chronic histoplasmosis. This can take months oryears. Symptoms of chronic histoplasmosis resemble thoseof tuberculosis . Cavities form in the lung tissue, parts of\nthe lung may collapse, and the lungs fill with fluid. Chronichistoplasmosis is a serious disease that can result in death .\nThe rarest form of histoplasmosis is disseminated\nhistoplasmosis. Disseminated histoplasmosis is seenalmost exclusively in patients with AIDS or other immunedefects. In disseminated histoplasmosis the infection maymove to the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or adrenal glands.Symptoms include a worsening of those found in chronichistoplasmosis, as well as weight loss, diarrhea , the\ndevelopment of open sores in the mouth and nose, andenlargement of the spleen, liver, and adrenal gland.\nDiagnosis\nA simple skin test similar to that given for tuberculosis\nwill tell if a person has previously been infected by the fun-gus H. capsulatum . Chest x rays often show lung damage\ncaused by the fungus, but do not lead to a definitive diagno-sis because the damage caused by other diseases has a sim-ilar appearance on the x ray. Diagnosis of chronic or dis-seminated histoplasmosis can be made by culturing a sam-ple of sputum or other body fluids in the laboratory to iso-late the fungus. The urine, blood serum, washings from thelungs, or cerebrospinal fluid can all be tested for the pres-ence of an antigen produced in response to the infection.Most cases of primary histoplasmosis go undiagnosed.\nTreatment\nAcute primary histoplasmosis generally requires no\ntreatment other than rest. Non-prescription drugs such as\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1640Histoplasmosis\nHistoplasmosis capsulatum\nHistoplasma capsulatum . If a person inhales the spores of\nthis fungus, they may contract histoplasmosis, an infec-tious disease which can exist in three forms: acute or pri-mary histoplasmosis, which causes flu-like symptoms;chronic histoplasmosis, which affects the lungs and can befatal; and disseminated histoplasmosis, which can affectmultiple body systems and is often fatal. (Illustration by Elec-\ntronic Illustrators Group.)acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used to treat pain and\nrelieve fever. Avoiding smoke and using a cool airhumidifier may ease chest pain.\nPatients with an intact immune system who develop\nchronic histoplasmosis are treated with the drug keto-conazole (Nizoral) or amphotericin B (Fungizone).Patients with suppressed immune systems are treatedwith amphotericin B, which is given intravenously.Because of its potentially toxic side effects, hospitaliza-tion is often required. The patient may also receive otherdrugs to minimize the side effects of the amphotericin B.\nPatients with AIDS must continue to take the drug\nitraconazole (Sporonox) orally for the rest of their livesin order to prevent a relapse. If the patient can not toler-ate itraconazole, the drug fluconazole (Diflucan) can besubstituted.\nAlternative treatment\nIn non-immunocompromised patients, alternative\ntherapies can be very successful. Alternative treatmentfor fungal infections focuses on creating an environmentwhere the fungus cannot survive. This is accomplishedby maintaining good health and eating a diet low in dairyproducts, sugars, including honey and fruit juice, andfoods like beer that contain yeast. This is complementedby a diet high in raw food. Supplements of antioxidantvitamins C, E, and A, along with B complex, may also\nbe added to the diet. Lactobacillus acidophilus andBifi-\ndobacteria will replenish the good bacteria in the\nintestines. Antifungal herbs, like garlic, can be consumedin relatively large does and for an extended period oftime in order to be most effective.\nPrognosis\nMost people recover from primary histoplasmosis in\na few weeks without medical intervention. Patients withchronic histoplasmosis who are treated with antifungaldrugs generally recover rapidly if they do not have anunderlying serious disease. When left untreated, or ifserious disease is present, histoplasmosis can be fatal.\nAIDS patients with disseminated histoplasmosis vary\nin their response to amphotericin B, depending on theirgeneral health and how well they tolerate the side effectsof the drug. Treatment often suppresses the infection tem-porarily, but patients with AIDS are always in danger of arelapse and must continue to take medication for the restof their lives to keep the infection at bay. New combina-tions of therapies and new drugs are constantly beingevaluated, making hard statistics on prognosis difficult tocome by. AIDS patients have problems with multipleopportunistic infections, making it difficult to isolatedeath rates due to any one particular fungal infection.KEY TERMS\nAcidophilus —The bacteria Lactobacillus aci-\ndophilus, usually found in yogurt.\nAdrenal gland —A pair of organs located above\nthe kidneys.

    "title": "Hives",
    "content": "Hives\nDefinition\nHives is an allergic skin reaction causing localized\nredness, swelling, and itching .\nDescription\nHives is a reaction of the body’s immune system that\ncauses areas of the skin to swell, itch, and become red-dened (wheals). When the reaction is limited to smallareas of the skin, it is called “urticaria.” Involvement oflarger areas, such as whole sections of a limb, is called“angioedema.”\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nHives is an allergic reaction. The body’s immune\nsystem is normally responsible for protection from for-eign invaders. When it becomes sensitized to normallyharmless substances, the resulting reaction is called anallergy. An attack of hives is set off when such a sub-stance, called an allergen, is ingested, inhaled, or other-wise contacted. It interacts with immune cells calledmast cells, which reside in the skin, airways, and diges-tive system. When mast cells encounter an allergen, theyrelease histamine and other chemicals, both locally andinto the bloodstream. These chemicals cause blood ves-sels to become more porous, allowing fluid to accumu-late in tissue and leading to the swollen and reddishappearance of hives. Some of the chemicals released sen-sitize pain nerve endings, causing the affected area to\nbecome itchy and sensitive.\nA wide variety of substances may cause hives in\nsensitive people, including foods, drugs, and insect bitesor stings. Common culprits include:\n• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and Brazil nuts• fish, mollusks, and shellfish• eggs• wheat• milk\n• strawberries\n• food additives and preservatives• penicillin or other antibiotics• flu vaccines\n• tetanus toxoid vaccine\n• gamma globulin\n• bee, wasp, and hornet stings\n• bites of mosquitoes, fleas, and scabies\nSymptoms\nUrticaria is characterized by redness, swelling, and\nitching of small areas of the skin. These patches usuallygrow and recede in less than a day, but may be replacedby others in other locations. Angioedema is characterizedby more diffuse swelling. Swelling of the airways maycause wheezing and respiratory distress. In severe cases,\nairway obstruction may occur.\nDiagnosis\nHives are easily diagnosed by visual inspection. The\ncause of hives is usually apparent, but may require acareful medical history in some cases.\nTreatment\nMild cases of hives are treated with antihistamines ,\nsuch as diphenhydramine (Benadryl). More severe casesmay require oral corticosteroids , such as prednisone. Top-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1642Hivesical corticosteroids are not effective. Airway swelling may\nrequire emergency injection of epinephrine (adrenaline).\nAlternative treatment\nAn alternative practitioner will try to determine what\nallergic substance is causing the reaction and help thepatient eliminate or minimize its effects. To deal with thesymptoms of hives, an oatmeal bath may help to relieveitching. Chickweed ( Stellaria media ), applied as a poul-\ntice (crushed or chopped herbs applied directly to theskin) or added to bath water, may also help relieve itch-ing. Several homeopathic remedies, including Urtica\nurens and Apis (Apis mellifica ), may help relieve the itch,\nredness, or swelling associated with hives.\nPrognosis\nMost cases of hives clear up within one to seven\ndays without treatment, providing the cause (allergen) isfound and avoided.\nPrevention\nPreventing hives depends on avoiding the allergen\ncausing them. Analysis of new items in the diet or newdrugs taken may reveal the likely source of the reaction.Chronic hives may be aggravated by stress ,caffeine ,\nalcohol, or tobacco; avoiding these may reduce the fre-quency of reactions.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLawlor Jr., G.

Hodgkin clearly differentiated between this diseaseand the much more common non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.Prior to 1970, few individuals survived Hodgkin’s disease.Now, however, the majority of individuals with this cancercan be cured.\nThe lymphatic system\nThe lymphatic system is part of the body’s immune\nsystem, for fighting disease, and a part of the blood-pro-ducing system. It includes the lymph vessels and nodes,and the spleen, bone marrow, and thymus. The narrowlymphatic vessels carry lymphatic fluid from throughoutthe body. The lymph nodes are small organs that filter thelymphatic fluid and trap foreign substances, includingviruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. The spleen, in theupper left abdomen, removes old cells and debris fromthe blood. The bone marrow, the tissue inside the bones,produces new red and white blood cells.\nLymphocytes are white blood cells that recognize\nand destroy disease-causing organisms. Lymphocytesare produced in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone mar-row. They circulate throughout the body in the bloodand lymphatic fluid. Clusters of immune cells also existin major organs.\nHodgkin’s lymphoma\nHodgkin’s disease is a type of lymphoma in which\nantibody-producing cells of the lymphatic system beginto grow abnormally. It usually begins in a lymph nodeand progresses slowly, in a fairly predictable way,spreading via the lymphatic vessels from one group oflymph nodes to the next. Sometimes it invades organsthat are adjacent to the lymph nodes. If the cancer cellsspread to the blood, the disease can reach almost any sitein the body. Advanced cases of Hodgkin’s disease mayinvolve the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lungs.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1643Hodgkin’s diseaseThere are different subtypes of Hodgkin’s disease:\n• nodular sclerosis (30–60% of cases)• mixed cellularity (20–40% of cases)• lymphocyte predominant (5–10% of cases)\n• lymphocyte depleted (less than 5% of cases)\n• unclassified\nDemographics\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that there\nwill be 7,400 new cases of Hodgkin’s disease in the Unit-ed States in 2001—3,500 in females and 3,900 in males.It is estimated that 700 men and 600 women in the Unit-ed States will die of the disease in 2001.\nHodgkin’s disease can occur at any age. However,\nthe majority of cases develop in early adulthood (ages15–40) and late adulthood (after age 55). Approximately10–15% of cases are in children under age 17. It is morecommon in boys than in girls under the age of 10. Thedisease is very rare in children under five.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of Hodgkin’s disease is not known. It is\nsuspected that some interaction between an individual’sgenetic makeup, environmental exposures, and infectiousagents may be responsible. Immune system deficienciesalso may be involved.\nEarly symptoms of Hodgkin’s disease may be simi-\nlar to those of the flu:\n• fevers, night sweats, chills•fatigue\n• loss of appetite• weight loss• itching\n• pain after drinking alcoholic beverages\n• swelling of one or more lymph nodes\nSudden or emergency symptoms of Hodgkin’s dis-\nease include:\n• sudden high fever• loss of bladder and/or bowel control• numbness in the arms and legs and a loss of strength\nAs lymph nodes swell, they may push on other\nstructures, causing a variety of symptoms:\n• pain due to pressure on nerve roots\n• loss of function in muscle groups served by compressed\nnerves• coughing or shortness of breath due to compression of\nthe windpipe and/or airways, by swollen lymph nodesin the chest\n• kidney failure from compression of the ureters, the\ntubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder\n• swelling in the face, neck, or legs, due to pressure on\nveins\n• paralysis in the legs due to pressure on the spinal cord\nAs Hodgkin’s disease progresses, the immune sys-\ntem becomes less effective at fighting infection. Thus,patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma become more sus-ceptible to both common infections caused by bacteriaand unusual (opportunistic) infections. Later symptomsof Hodgkin’s disease include the formation of tumors.\nSignificantly, as many as 75% of individuals with\nHodgkin’s disease do not have any typical symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nAs with many forms of cancer, diagnosis of Hodg-\nkin’s disease has two major components.\n• identification of Hodgkin’s lymphoma as the cause of\nthe patient’s disease\n• staging of the disease to determine how far the cancer\nhas spread\nThe initial diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease often results\nfrom abnormalities in a chest x ray that was performed\nbecause of nonspecific symptoms. The physician thentakes a medical history to check for the presence of symp-toms and conducts a complete physical examination .\nLymph node biopsy\nThe size, tenderness, firmness, and location of\nswollen lymph nodes are determined and correlated withany signs of infection. In particular, lymph nodes that donot shrink after treatment with antibiotics may be a\ncause for concern. The lymph nodes that are most oftenaffected by Hodgkin’s disease include those of the neck,above the collarbone, under the arms, and in the chestabove the diaphragm.\nDiagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease requires either the\nremoval of an entire enlarged lymph node (an excisionalbiopsy) or an incisional biopsy, in which only a smallpart of a large tumor is removed. If the node is near theskin, the biopsy is performed with a local anesthetic.However, if it is inside the chest or abdomen, generalanesthesia is required.\nThe sample of biopsied tissue is examined under a\nmicroscope. Giant cells called Reed-Sternberg cells mustbe present to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1644Hodgkin’s diseaseThese cells, which usually contain two or more nuclei,\nare named for the two pathologists who discovered them.Normal cells have only one nucleus (the organelle withinthe cell that contains the genetic material). Affectedlymph nodes may contain only a few Reed-Sternbergcells and they may be difficult to recognize. Characteris-tics of other types of cells in the biopsied tissue help todiagnose the subtype of Hodgkin’s disease.\nA fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, in which a\nthin needle and syringe are used to remove a smallamount of fluid and bits of tissue from a tumor, has theadvantage of not requiring surgery. An FNA may be per-formed prior to an excisional or incisional biopsy, tocheck for infection or for the spread of cancer fromanother organ. However an FNA biopsy does not provideenough tissue to diagnose Hodgkin’s disease.\nOccasionally, additional biopsies are required to\ndiagnose Hodgkin’s disease. In rare instances, other tests,that detect certain substances on the surfaces of cancercells or changes in the DNA of cells, are used to distin-guish Hodgkin’s disease from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\nClinical staging\nStaging is very important in Hodgkin’s disease. This\nis because the cancer usually spreads in a predictable pat-tern, without skipping sets of lymph nodes until late inthe progression of the disease.\nIMAGING. Imaging of the abdomen, chest, and\npelvis is used to identify areas of enlarged lymph nodesand abnormalities in the spleen or other organs. Comput-erized axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans use a rotat-ing x ray beam to obtain pictures. Magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) uses magnetic fields and radio waves to\nproduce images of the body. Chest x rays also may betaken. These images will reveal rounded lumps callednodules in the affected lymph nodes and other organs.\nAnother imaging technique for Hodgkin’s disease is\na gallium scan, in which the radioactive element galliumis injected into a vein. The cancer cells take up the galli-um and a special camera that detects the gallium is usedto determine the location and size of tumors. Galliumscans are used when Hodgkin’s disease is in the chestand may be hard to detect by other methods. Galliumscans also are used to monitor progress during treatment.\nA lymphangiogram, a radiograph of the lymphatic\nvessels, involves injecting a dye into a lymphatic vesselin the foot. Tracking of the dye locates the disease in theabdomen and pelvis. This method is used less frequentlyand is usually not used with children.\nPositron emission tomography (PET ) scans are an\nextremely accurate method for staging Hodgkin’s disease.DOROTHY MENDENHALL\n(1874–1964)\nDorothy Reed Mendenhall, the last of three chil-\ndren, was born September 22, 1874, in Columbus,Ohio, to William Pratt Reed, a shoe manufacturer, andGrace Kimball Reed, both of whom had descendedfrom English settlers who came to America in the seven-teenth century. Mendenhall attended Smith College andobtained a baccalaureate degree. Although she initiallycontemplated a career in journalism, Mendenhall’sinterest in medicine was inspired by a biology courseshe attended.\nDorothy Reed Mendenhall was a well respected\nresearcher, obstetrician, and pioneer in methods ofchildbirth. She was the first to discover that Hodgkin’sdisease was not a form of tuberculosis, as had beenthought. This finding received international acclaim. Asa result of her work, the cell type characteristic ofHodgkin’s disease bears her name. The loss of her firstchild due to poor obstetrics changed her research careerto a lifelong effort to reduce infant mortality rates.Mendenhall’s efforts paid off with standards being setfor weight and height for children ages birth to six andalso in programs that stressed the health of both themother and child in the birthing process.\nA very low dose of radioactive glucose, a sugar, is inject-\ned into the body. The glucose travels to metabolically-active sites, including cancerous regions that require largeamounts of glucose. The PET scan detects the radioactivi-ty and produces images of the entire body that distinguishbetween cancerous and non-cancerous tissues.\nBONE MARROW. Anemia (a low red-blood-cell\ncount), fevers, or night sweats are indications thatHodgkin’s disease may be in the bone marrow. In thesecases, a bone-marrow biopsy, in which a large needle isused to remove a narrow, cylindrical piece of bone, maybe necessary to determine the spread of the cancer. Alter-natively, an aspiration, in which a needle is used toremove small bits of bone marrow, may be used. Themarrow usually is removed from the back of the hip orother large bone.\nPathological staging\nSometimes further staging, called pathological stag-\ning or a staging laparotomy, is used for Hodgkin’s dis-ease. In this operation, a surgeon checks the abdominallymph nodes and other organs for cancer and removessmall pieces of tissue. A pathologist examines the tissuesamples for Hodgkin’s disease cells. Usually the spleen\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1645Hodgkin’s diseaseis removed (a splenectomy ) during the laparotomy. The\nsplenectomy helps with staging Hodgkin’s disease, aswell as removing a disease site.\nTreatment\nThe stages\nAll of the available treatments for Hodgkin’s disease\nhave serious side effects, both short and long-term. How-ever, with accurate staging, physicians and patients oftencan choose the minimum treatment that will cure the dis-ease. The staging system for Hodgkin’s disease is theAnn Arbor Staging Classification, also called theCotswold System or the Revised Ann Arbor System.\nHodgkin’s disease is divided into four stages, with\nadditional substages:\n• Stage I: The disease is confined to one lymph node area\n• Stage IE: The disease extends from the one lymph node\narea to adjacent regions\n• Stage II: The disease is in two or more lymph node\nareas on one side of the diaphragm (the muscle belowthe lungs)\n• Stage IIE: The disease extends to adjacent regions of at\nleast one of these nodes\n• Stage III: The disease is in lymph node areas on both\nsides of the diaphragm\n• Stage IIIE/IIISE: The disease extends into adjacent\nareas or organs (IIIE) and/or the spleen (IIISE)\n• Stage IV: The disease has spread from the lymphatic\nsystem to one or more other organs, such as the bonemarrow or liver\nTreatment for Hodgkin’s disease depends both on\nthe stage of the disease and whether or not symptoms arepresent. Stages are labeled with an A if no symptoms arepresent. If symptoms are present, the stage is labeledwith a B. These symptoms include:\n• loss of more than 10% of body weight over the previous\nsix months\n• fevers above 100°F (37.7°C)\n• drenching night sweats\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy and/or chemotherapy (drug\ntherapy) are the standard treatments for Hodgkin’s dis-ease. If the disease is confined to one area of the body,radiotherapy is usually used. This treatment, with x raysor other high-energy rays, also is used when the diseaseis in bulky areas such as the chest, where chemothera-peutic drugs cannot reach all of the cancer. External-beam radiation, a focused beam from an external\nmachine, is used to irradiate only the affected lymphnodes. This procedure is called involved field radiation.\nMore advanced stages of Hodgkin’s disease may be\ntreated with mantle field radiation, in which the lymphnodes of the neck, chest, and underarms are irradiated.Inverted Y field radiation is used to irradiate the spleenand the lymph nodes in the upper abdomen and pelvis.Total nodal irradiation includes both mantle field andinverted Y field radiation.\nSince external-beam radiation damages healthy tissue\nnear the cancer cells, the temporary side effects of radio-therapy can include sunburn-like skin damage, fatigue,nausea, and diarrhea . Other temporary side effects may\ninclude a sore throat and difficulty swallowing. Long-\nterm side effects depend on the dose and the location ofthe radiation and the age of the patient. Since radiation ofthe ovaries causes permanent sterility (the inability to haveoffspring), the ovaries of girls and young women are pro-tected during radiotherapy. Sometimes the ovaries are sur-gically moved from the region to be irradiated.\nChemotherapy\nIf the Hodgkin’s disease has progressed to additional\nlymph nodes or other organs, or if there is a recurrence ofthe disease within two years of radiation treatment,chemotherapy is used.\nChemotherapy utilizes a combination of drugs, each\nof which kills cancer cells in a different way. The mostcommon chemotherapy regimens for Hodgkin’s diseaseare MOPP (either mechlorethamine or methotrexate withOncovin, procarbazine, prednisone) and ABVD (Adri-amycin or doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacar-bazine). Each of these consists of four different drugs.ABVD is used more frequently than MOPP because ithas fewer severe side effects. However MOPP is used forindividuals who are at risk for heart failure . The\nchemotherapeutic drugs may be injected into a vein ormuscle, or taken orally, as a pill or liquid.\nChildren who are sexually mature when they develop\nHodgkin’s disease, and whose muscle and bone mass arealmost completely developed, usually receive the sametreatment as adults. Younger children usually are treatedwith chemotherapy, since radiation will adversely affectbone and muscle growth. However, radiation may be usedin low dosages, in combination with chemotherapy. Thechemotherapy for children with Hodgkin’s disease usual-ly includes more drugs than ABVD and MOPP.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy for Hodgkin’s dis-\nease depend on the dose of drugs and the length of time theyare taken. Since these drugs target rapidly dividing cancer\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1646Hodgkin’s diseasecells, they also affect normal cells that grow rapidly. These\ninclude the cells of the bone marrow, the linings of themouth and intestines, and hair fo llicles. Damage to bone\nmarrow leads to lower white blood cell counts and lowerresistance to infection. It also leads to lower red blood cellcounts, which can result in fatigue and easy bleeding andbruising. Damage to intestinal cells leads to a loss ofappetite, nausea, and vomiting. Mouth sores and hair lossalso are common side effects of chemotherapy. These sideeffects disappear when the chemotherapy is discontinued.Some drugs can reduce or prevent the nausea and vomiting .\nChemotherapy for Hodgkin’s disease may lead to\nlong-term complications. The drugs may damage theheart, lungs, kidneys, and liver. In children, growth maybe impeded. Some chemotherapy can cause sterility, somen may choose to have their sperm frozen prior to treat-ment. Women may stop ovulating and menstruating dur-ing chemotherapy. This may or may not be permanent.\nTreatment for higher-stage Hodgkin’s disease often\ninvolves a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.Following three or four chemotherapy regimens, involvedfield radiation may be directed at the most affected areas ofthe body. The long-term side effects often are more severewhen radiation and chemotherapy are used in combination.\nThe development of a second type of cancer is the\nmost serious risk from radiation and chemotherapy treat-ment for Hodgkin’s disease. In particular, there is a riskof developing leukemia, breast cancer , bone cancer, or\nthyroid cancer . Chemotherapy, particularly MOPP, or\nchemotherapy in conjunction with radiotherapy, signifi-cantly increases the risk for leukemia.\nRESISTANT, PROGRESSIVE, AND RECURRENT HODG-\nKIN’S DISEASE. Following treatment, the original diagnos-\ntic tests for Hodgkin’s disease are repeated, to determinewhether all traces of the cancer have been eliminated andto check for long-term side effects of treatment. In resis-tant Hodgkin’s disease, some cancer cells remain follow-ing treatment. If the cancer continues to spread duringtreatment, it is called progressive Hodgkin’s disease. If thedisease returns after treatment, it is known as recurrentHodgkin’s disease. It may recur in the area where it firststarted or elsewhere in the body. It may recur immediatelyafter treatment or many years later.\nAdditional treatment is necessary with these types of\nHodgkin’s disease. If the initial treatment was radiationtherapy alone, chemotherapy may be used, or vice versa.Chemotherapy with different drugs, or higher doses, maybe used to treat recurrent Hodgkin’s. However, radiationto the same area is never repeated.\nBONE MARROW AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM\nCELL TRANSPLANTATIONS. An autologous bone marrow\nand/or a peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(PBSCT) often is recommended for treating resistant or\nrecurrent Hodgkin’s disease, particularly if the diseaserecurs within a few months of a chemotherapy-inducedremission. These transplants are autologous because theyutilize the individual’s own cells. The patient’s bone mar-row cells or peripheral blood stem cells (immature bonemarrow cells found in the blood) are collected and frozenprior to high-dosage chemotherapy, which destroys bonemarrow cells. A procedure called leukapheresis is used tocollect the stem cells. Following the high-dosagechemotherapy, and possibly radiation, the bone marrowcells or stem cells are reinjected into the individual.\nAlternative treatment\nMost complementary therapies for Hodgkin’s dis-\nease are designed to stimulate the immune system todestroy cancer cells and repair normal cells that havebeen damaged by treatment. These therapies are used inconjunction with standard treatment.\nImmunologic therapies , also known as immuno-\ntherapies, biological therapies, or biological responsemodifier therapies, utilize substances that are produced bythe immune system. These include interferon (an immunesystem protein), monoclonal antibodies (specially engi-neered antibodies), colony-stimulating (growth) factors(such as filgrastim), and vaccines. Many immunothera-pies for Hodgkin’s disease are experimental and available\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1647Hodgkin’s disease\nA scanning electron micrograph (SEM) image of dividing\nHodgkin’s cells from the pleural effusions (abnormal accu-mulations of fluid in the lungs) of a 55-year-old male patient.(Photograph by Dr. Andrejs Liepins, Photo Researchers, Inc.Reproduced by permission.)only through clinical trials. These biological agents may\nhave side effects.\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and polysaccharide K\n(PSK) are being evaluated for their ability to stimulatethe immune system and protect healthy tissue, as well aspossible anti-cancer activities. Camphor, also known as714-X, green tea, and hoxsey (which is a mixture of anumber of substances), have been promoted as immunesystem enhancers.

    "title": "Holistic medicine",
    "content": "Holistic medicine\nDefinition\nHolistic medicine is a term used to describe thera-\npies that attempt to treat the patient as a whole person.That is, instead of treating an illness, as in orthodoxallopathy, holistic medicine looks at an individual’s over-all physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1649Holistic medicinebefore recommending treatment. A practitioner with a\nholistic approach treats the symptoms of illness as wellas looking for the underlying cause of the illness. Holis-tic medicine also attempts to prevent illness by placing agreater emphasis on optimizing health. The body’s sys-tems are seen as interdependent parts of the person’swhole being. Its natural state is one of health, and an ill-ness or disease is an imbalance in the body’s systems.Holistic therapies tend to emphasize proper nutrition\nand avoidance of substances—such as chemicals—thatpollute the body. Their techniques are non-invasive.\nSome of the world’s health systems that are holistic\nin nature include naturopathic medicine ,homeopathy ,\nand traditional Chinese medicine . Many alternative or\nnatural therapies have a holistic approach, although thatis not always the case. The term complementary medi-cine is used to refer to the use of both allopathic andholistic treatments. It is more often used in Great Britain,but is gaining acceptance in the United States.\nThere are no limits to the range of diseases and dis-\norders that can be treated in a holistic way, as the princi-ple of holistic healing is to balance the body, mind, spirit,and emotions so that the person’s whole being functionssmoothly. When an individual seeks holistic treatmentfor a particular illness or condition, other health prob-lems improve without direct treatment, due to improve-ment in the performance of the immune system, which isone of the goals of holistic medicine.\nOrigins\nThe concept of holistic medicine is not new. In the\n4th century B.C., Socrates warned that treating one part of\nthe body only would not have good results. Hippocratesconsidered that many factors contribute to the health orotherwise of a human being, weather, nutrition, emotion-al factors, and in our time, a host of different sources ofpollution can interfere with health. And of course, holis-tic medicine existed even before ancient Greece in someancient healing traditions, such as those from India andChina, which date back over 5,000 years. However, theterm “holistic” only became part of everyday language inthe 1970s, when Westerners began seeking an alternativeto allopathic medicine.\nInterestingly, it was only at the beginning of the twen-\ntieth century that the principles of holistic medicine fell outof favor in Western societies, with the advent of majoradvances in what we now call allopathic medicine. Para-doxically, many discoveries of the twentieth century haveonly served to confirm many natural medicine theories. Inmany cases, researchers have set out to debunk holisticmedicine, only to find that their research confirms it, as hasbeen the case, for example, with many herbal remedies.Purpose\nMany people are now turning to holistic medicine,\noften when suffering from chronic ailments that have notbeen successfully treated by allopathic means. Althoughmany wonderful advances and discoveries have beenmade in modern medicine, surgery and drugs alone havea very poor record for producing optimal health becausethey are designed to attack illness. Holistic medicine isparticularly helpful in treating chronic illnesses andmaintaining health through proper nutrition and stress\nmanagement.\nDescription\nThere are a number of therapies that come under the\numbrella of “holistic medicine.” They all use basicallythe same principles, promoting not only physical health,but also mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Mostemphasize quality nutrition. Refined foods typicallyeaten in modern America contain chemical additives andpreservatives, are high in fat, cholesterol, and sugars, andpromote disease. Alternative nutritionists counter that byrecommending whole foods whenever possible and mini-mizing the amount of meat—especially red meat—that isconsumed. Many alternative therapies promote vegetari-\nanism as a method of detoxification .\nThe aim of holistic medicine is to bring all areas of\nan individual’s life, and most particularly the energyflowing through the body, back into harmony. Ultimate-ly, of course, only the patient can be responsible for this,for no practitioner can make the necessary adjustments todiet and lifestyle to achieve health. The practice of holis-tic medicine does not rule out the practice of allopathicmedicine; the two can complement each other.\nA properly balanced holistic health regimen, which\ntakes into consideration all aspects of human health andincludes noninvasive and nonpharmaceutical healingmethods, can often completely eradicate even acutehealth conditions safely. If a patient is being treated withallopathic medicine, holistic therapies may at least sup-port the body during treatment, and alleviate the symp-toms that often come with drug treatments and surgery.In addition, holistic therapies aim at the underlyingsource of the illness, to prevent recurrence.\nHere are some of the major holistic therapies:\n• herbal medicine• homeopathy\n• naturopathic medicine\n• traditional Chinese medicine\n• Ayurvedic medicine\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1650Holistic medicine• nutritional therapies\n•chiropractic\n• stress reduction\n• psychotherapy• massage\nBecause holistic medicine aims to treat the whole\nperson, holistic practitioners sometimes may advise treat-ment from more than one type of practitioner. This is toensure that all aspects of health are addressed. Some prac-titioners also specialize in more than one therapy, and somay be able to offer more comprehensive assistance.\nPreparations\nHow to choose a holistic practitioner\n• How did you hear of this therapist? A personal referral\ncan sometimes be more reliable than a professionalone. What do other professionals say about this thera-\npist? What qualifications, board certification, or affilia-tions does this practitioner have?\n• How do you feel personally about this practitioner? Do\nyou feel comfortable in his/her office and with his/herstaff? Is your sense of well being increased? Are youkept waiting for appointments?\n• Do you have confidence in this practitioner, does he/she\nrespect you as a person? Does he/she show an interestin your family, lifestyle, and diet? Are various treatmentoptions explained to you?\n• Is your personal dignity respected?\n• Do you feel that this practitioner is sensitive to your\nfeelings and fears regarding treatment?\n• Is this practitioner a good advertisement for his/her pro-\nfession? Signs of stress or ill health may mean that youwould be better off choosing another practitioner.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1651Holistic medicine\nANDREW WEIL (1942– )\nDr. Andrew Weil, a Harvard-educated physician,\nadds credibility and expertise to the natural healing meth-ods he espouses in his best-selling books, on his InternetWeb site, in his talk show appearances, and in his popu-lar audio CD of music and meditation . Weil’s Sponta-\nneous Healing spent more than a year on the best-sellerlist, and his 1997 book, Eight Weeks to Optimum Health ,\nalso was a runaway best-seller. Perhaps the best-knownproponent of naturalistic healing methods, Weil has beentrying to establish a field he calls integrative medicine. Heis director of Tucson’s Center for Integrative Medicine,which he founded in 1993. In 1997, he began trainingdoctors in the discipline at the University of Arizona,where he teaches.\nAfter getting his bachelor’s degree in botany from\nHarvard University, Weil applied for admission to HarvardMedical School in 1964. During his second year, he led agroup of students who argued they could succeed betterstudying on their own than going to classes; in fact, thegroup got higher scores on their final exams than theirclassmates. After graduating from Harvard MedicalSchool, he volunteered at the notorious counter- culturalHaight-Asbury Free Clinic in San Francisco, CA. Later in1969, Weil got a job in Washington, DC, with the Nation-al Institute of Mental Health’s Drug Studies Division. From1971 to 1975, he traveled extensively in South Americaand Africa, soaking up information about medicinalplants, shamanism , and natural healing techniques. He\nnever returned to the practice of conventional medicine.\nHis approach to alternative medicine is eclectic,\nmingling traditional medicine with herbal therapy,acupuncture , homeopathy , chiropractic , hypnotism, cra-\nnial manipulation, and other alternative healing methods.Though his books discuss the benefits of everything fromhealing touch to herbal cures, Weil doesn’t dismiss thebenefits of standard Western medicine when appropriate.\n(Photograph by M. Greenberg. Gamma Liaison. Reproduced\nby permission.)• Do you feel that you are rushed into decisions, or do\nyou feel that you are allowed time to make an informedchoice regarding treatment?\n• Are future health goals outlined for you? And do you feel\nthat the practitioner is taking your progress seriously?\n• Do you feel unconditionally accepted by this practitioner?\n• Would you send your loved ones to this practitioner?\nIf you answered yes to all the above, then you have\nfound a suitable practitioner. The cost of treatment by aholistic therapist varies widely, depending on the level ofqualification and the discipline, so it is best to discusshow much treatment can be expected to cost with a prac-titioner before beginning a course. Some forms of holis-tic treatment may be covered by health insurance.\nPrecautions\nMany people who try holistic therapies focus on one\narea of their health only, often detoxification and nutri-tion. However, practitioners stress that it is only when allareas of a person’s potential well being are tackled thattotal health and happiness can be achieved. They stressthat the spiritual and emotional health contribute just asmuch as physical and mental health to a person’s overallstate of well-being.\nWhen seeking treatment from a holistic practitioner, it\nis important to ensure that they are properly qualified. Cre-dentials and reputation should always be checked. In addi-tion, it is important that allopathic physicians and alterna-tive physicians communicate about a patient’s care.\nSide effects\nOne of the main advantages of holistic therapies is\nthat they have few side effects when used correctly. If areputable practitioner is chosen, and guidelines areadhered to, the worst that typically happens is that whenlifestyle is changed, and fresh nutrients are provided, thebody begins to eliminate toxins that may have accumu-lated in the cells over a lifetime.\nOften this results in what is known in alternative\nmedicine circles as a “healing crisis.” This comes aboutwhen the cells eliminate poisons into the blood stream allat the same time, throwing the system into a state of toxicoverload until it can clear the “backlog.” Symptoms suchas nausea, headaches, or sensitivities to noise and otherstimulations may be experienced.\nThe answer to most otherwise healthy patients is\noften just to lie quietly in a darkened room and takeherbal teas. However, in the case of someone who has aserious illness, such as arthritis, colitis, diabetes, or can-\ncer, (the list is much longer than this), it is stronglyadvised that they seek the help of a qualified practitioner.\nTherapists can help patients achieve detoxification in away that causes the least stress to their bodies.\nResearch and general acceptance\nTraditionally, holistic medicine, in all its different\nforms, has been regarded with mistrust and skepticism onthe part of the allopathic medical profession. This situa-tion is gradually changing. As of the year 2000, manyinsurance companies will provide for some form of alter-native, or complementary treatment.\nIn addition, many allopathic physicians, recognizing\nthe role alternative medicine can play in overall healthand well being, are actually referring patients to reputablepractitioners, particularly chiropractic and relaxation ther-apists, for help with a varied range of complaints.\nTraining and certification\nHolistic or alternative medicine practitioners are\nusually affiliated with an organization in their field.Training varies tremendously with the category, andranges from no qualifications at all—experience only—to holding a Ph.D. from an accredited university. Again,credentials and memberships should be checked byprospective patients.\nAn excellent source for qualified practitioners is the\nAmerican Board of Holistic Medicine, (AHBM), whichwas incorporated in 1996. Also, the American HolisticMedicine Association has a comprehensive list of practi-tioners in all types of therapies across the United States,which they call “the holistic doctor finder.” However,they stress that it is the responsibility of the patient tocheck each practitioner’s credentials prior to treatment.\nThe ABHM has established the core curriculum\nupon which board certification for holistic medicine willbe based. It includes the following twelve categories:\nBody\nPhysical and environmental health\n• nutritional medicine\n• exercise medicine• environmental medicine\nMind\nMental and emotional health\n• behavioral medicine\nSpirit\nSpiritual health\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1652Holistic medicine• spiritual attunement\n• social health\nThe six specialized areas:\n• biomolecular diagnosis and therapy\n• botanical medicine• energy medicine• ethno-medicine—including traditional Chinese medi-\ncine, Ayurveda, and Native American medicine\n• homeopathy• manual medicine\nFounded in 1978 for the purpose of uniting practition-\ners of holistic medicine, membership of the AHMA isopen to licensed medical doctors (MDs) and doctors ofosteopathic medicine (DOs) from every specialty, and tomedical students studying for those degrees. Associatemembership is open to health care practitioners who arecertified, registered or licensed in the state in which theypractice. The mission of the AHMA is to support practi-tioners in their personal and professional development ashealers, and to educate physicians about holistic medicine.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGoldberg, Burton.

Patients wear the Holter monitorwhile carrying out their usual daily activities.\nPurpose\nHolter monitoring is used to help determine whether\nsomeone has an otherwise undetected heart disease, suchas abnormal heart rhythm (cardiac arrhythmia), or inade-quate blood flow through the heart. Specifically, it candetect abnormal electrical activity in the heart that mayoccur randomly or only under certain circumstances, suchas during sleep or periods of physical activity or stress ,\nwhich may or may not be picked up by standard, short-term electrocardiography performed in a doctor’s office.\nTraditionally, an exercise stress test has been used\nto screen people for “silent” heart disease (heart diseasewith none of the usual symptoms). However, an exercisestress test is not completely foolproof, often producingfalse negative results (indicating no heart disease whenheart disease is actually present) and false positives (indi-cating heart disease when there is none). Furthermore,some people cannot undergo exercise stress testingbecause of other medical conditions, such as arthritis.\nHolter monitoring, also known as ambulatory or 24-\nhour electrocardiography, offers an alternate means oftesting people for heart disease. By monitoring electro-cardiographic activity throughout the day, Holter moni-toring can uncover heart problems that occur during thepatient’s everyday activities. It can also help to recognizeany activities that may be causing the heart problems.And it can define and correlate symptoms that may becaused by irregularities of the heart.\nPrecautions\nHolter monitoring is an extremely safe procedure\nand no special precautions are required.\nDescription\nThe technician affixes electrodes on the surface of\nthe skin at specific areas of the patient’s chest, usingadhesive patches with special gel that conducts electricalimpulses. Typically, electrodes are placed under eachcollarbone and each bottom rib, and several electrodesare placed across the chest in a rough outline of the heart.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1653Holter monitoringThe electrodes are attached to a portable electrocardio-\ngraphic device called a Holter monitor, which records theelectrical activity of the heart over 24–48 hours. Thedevice is worn over the patient’s shoulder or attached to abelt around the waist.\nThe Holter monitor records the continuous electrical\nactivity throughout the course of the day, while the patientcarries out his or her daily activities. During this time, thepatient also keeps a detailed log or diary, recording his orher various activities, such as exercise, eating, sleeping,straining, breathing too hard (hyperventilating), and anystressful situations. The patient also notes the time andcircumstances of any symptoms—especially chest pain ,\ndizziness ,shortness of breath , heart palpitations , and\nany other signs of heart trouble. Some Holter monitorsallow patients to record their symptoms electronically,highlighting the portion of the electrocardiogram record-ed while the symptoms are occurring.After 24–48 hours, the Holter monitor is removed. A\ncomputer-assisted analysis is performed on the electro-cardiographic recording, and the doctor compares therecording against the patient’s log to see if there is anycorrelation between electrocardiographic abnormalitiesand any of the patient’s activities or symptoms. Thephysician makes a final interpretation.\nPreparation\nIn the doctor’s office, electrodes are attached to the\npatient’s chest. In some cases, the patient’s chest hairmay have to be shaved to facilitate attaching the elec-trodes. The patient then begins carrying the monitor on ashoulder harness, in a pocket, or on the belt while carry-ing out his or her usual daily routine. The patient shouldinform the doctor of any drugs he or she may be taking,because certain drugs can alter heart rhythms and mayaffect the results of the test.\nAftercare\nThe patient returns to the doctor’s office to have the\nmonitor and electrodes removed. No special measuresneed to be taken following Holter monitoring. The testresults are usually available within a few days after themonitor is removed.\nRisks\nThere are no known risks associated with Holter mon-\nitoring. The main complaint that people have with Holtermonitoring is that the monitor may be cumbersome andinterfere with certain activities, especially sleeping.Bathing and showering are not allowed during the study.\nNormal results\nA normal Holter monitoring test shows relatively\nnormal electrical activity in the heart around the clockand no evidence of silent ischemia (deprivation of oxy-\ngen-rich blood).\nAbnormal results\nAn abnormal result on Holter monitoring may indicate\nischemia to the heart muscle or heart rhythm disturbances.Abnormalities are especially likely to show up during peri-ods of stress or heavy activity, but sometimes seriousabnormalities are recorded while the patient is sleeping.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFaculty Members of the Yale University School of Medicine.\nThe Patient’s Book of Medical Tests.

    "title": "Holtzman ink blot test",
    "content": "Holtzman ink blot test\nDefinition\nThe Holtzman Inkblot Technique (HIT) is a projec-\ntive personality assessment test for persons ages fiveand up.\nPurpose\nThe HIT is used to assess the personality structure of\na test subject. It is sometimes used as a diagnostic tool inassessing schizophrenia , depression, addiction , and\ncharacter disorders.\nPrecautions\nPsychometric testing requires a clinically trained\nexaminer. The HIT should be administered and interpret-ed by a trained psychologist, psychiatrist, or appropriate-ly trained mental health professional.\nSome consider projective tests to be less reliable\nthan objective personality tests. If the examiner is notwell-trained in psychometric evaluation, subjective inter-pretations may affect the outcome of the test.\nDescription\nThe HIT, developed by psychologist Wayne Holtz-\nman and colleagues, was introduced in 1961. The testwas designed to overcome some of the deficiencies of itsfamous predecessor, the Rorschach Inkblot Test.\nUnlike the Rorschach, the Holtzman is a standard-\nized measurement with clearly defined objective scor-ing criteria. The HIT consists of 45 inkblots. The testadministrator, or examiner, has a stack of 47 cards withKEY TERMS\nProjective personality assessment —A test in\nwhich the subject is asked to interpret ambiguousstimuli, such as an inkblot. The subject’s responsesprovide insight into his or her thought processes.\nStandardization —The process of determining\nestablished norms and procedures for a test to actas a standard reference point for future test results.\ninkblots (45 test cards and 2 practice cards) face down\nin front of him or her. The examiner hands each card tothe subject and asks the test subject what he or she seesin the inkblot. Only one response per inkblot isrequested. Occasionally, the examiner may ask the testsubject to clarify or elaborate on a response. TheAdministration of the HIT typically takes 50–80 min-utes. The HIT is then scored against 22 personality-related characteristics.\nThe HIT can also be administered in a group set-\nting. In group testing, 30–45 inkblots are projected ontoa screen and test subjects provide written responses toeach inkblot.\nThe 1997 Medicare reimbursement rate for psycho-\nlogical and neuropsychological testing is $58.35 anhour. Billing time typically includes test administration,scoring and interpretation, and reporting. Many insur-ance plans cover all or a portion of diagnostic psycho-logical testing.\nNormal results\nBecause of the complexity of the scoring process\nand the projective nature of the test, results for the HITshould only be interpreted by a clinically trained psy-chologist, psychiatrist, or appropriately trained mentalhealth professional.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMaddox, Taddy.

In homeopathic medicine,acute refers primarily to the speed of onset and self-limit-ing character of the disorder rather than its seriousness.Colds, influenza , sore throats, insect stings, cuts, bruis-\nes, vomiting, diarrhea ,fever , muscle aches, and short-\nterm insomnia are all examples of conditions that are\ntreated by acute prescribing. The remedies given in acutehomeopathic prescribing are intended to stimulate thebody’s internal ability to heal itself; they do not killgerms or suppress symptoms. Acute prescribing can bedone—within limits—by patients at home, as well as byhomeopathic practitioners. Study courses, self-treatmentguides, and homeopathic home medicine kits are nowavailable by mail order from homeopathic pharmaciesand educational services.\nPurpose\nHomeopathic physicians seek to cure their patients on\nphysical, mental, and emotional levels, and each treatmentis tailored to a patient’s individual needs. Homeopathy isgenerally a safe treatment, as it uses medicines in extreme-ly diluted quantities, and there are usually minimal sideeffects. Its non-toxicity makes it a good choice for thetreatment of children. Another benefit of homeopathy isthe cost of treatments; homeopathic remedies are inexpen-sive, often a fraction of the cost of conventional drugs.\nAcute homeopathic prescribing is thought to benefit a\nwide range of ailments. These include altitude sickness ,\nBell’s palsy , the common cold ,allergies , coughing,\ndengue fever , dysentery, earaches, migraine headaches,\nfever, food poisoning , grief, influenza, motion sickness ,\nshock ,sore throat , surgical complications, and reactions\nto vaccinations and drug therapy. Acute remedies may alsobe prescribed to treat insect stings, animal bites, and prob-lems related to poison oak and poison ivy. It may be fur-ther employed in treating injuries including black eyes,burns , bruises, concussions, cuts, damaged tendons and\nligaments, dislocations, fractures , herniated discs, nose-\nbleeds, puncture wounds , sprains, and strains.\nDescription\nOrigins\nHomeopathy is a gentle, painless, holistic system of\nhealing developed during the 1790s by Samuel Hahne-mann, a German physician. Experimenting on himselfwith the anti-malarial drug quinine, Hahnemann noticedthat large doses of the medicine actually caused malaria-like symptoms, while smaller doses cured the symptoms.From this, he advanced his concept of Similia similibus\ncurentur , or “let like be cured with like.” Hahnemann\nthen developed an extensive system of medicine basedon this concept. He named it homeopathy, from theGreek words homoios (the same) and pathos (suffering).\nHomeopathic remedies are almost always made\nfrom natural materials—plant, animal, or mineral sub-stances—that have been treated to form mother tincturesor nonsoluble powders. Liquid extracts are then poten-tized, or increased in power, by a series of dilutions andsuccussions, or shakings. It is thought that succussion isnecessary to transfer the energy of the natural substanceto the solution. In addition, the potency of the remedy isregarded as increasing with each dilution. After the tinc-ture has been diluted to the prescribed potency, theresulting solution is added to a bottle of sucrose/lactosetablets, which are stored in a cool, dark place. If the rem-edy is not soluble in water, it is ground to a fine powderand triturated with powdered lactose to achieve thedesired potency.\nProponents of homeopathy over the years have\nincluded Louisa May Alcott, Charles Dickens, BenjaminDisraeli, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, NathanielHawthorne, William James, Henry Wadsworth Longfel-low, Pope Pius X, John D. Rockefeller, Harriet BeecherStowe, William Thackeray, Daniel Webster, and W. B.Yeats. England’s Royal Family has employed homeo-pathic practitioners since the 1830s.\nHomeopathic prescribing differs in general from\nallopathic medicine in its tailoring of remedies to thepatient’s overall personality type and totality of symp-toms, rather than to the disease. Whereas a conventionalphysician would prescribe the same medication or treat-ment regimen to all patients with the common cold, forexample, a homeopathic practitioner would ask detailedquestions about each patient’s symptoms and the modali-ties, or factors, that make them better or worse. As a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1656Homeopathy medicine, acute prescribingresult, the homeopath might prescribe six different reme-\ndies for six different patients with the same illness. Inacute prescribing homeopathy, consultations are morebrief compared to constitutional homeopathic prescrib-ing. A typical patient might spend just 10–15 minuteswith the practitioner, compared to more than an hour forconstitutional prescribing.\nHomeopathic classification of symptoms\nHomeopathic practitioners use the word symptom in\na more inclusive fashion than traditional medicine. Inhomeopathy, symptoms include any change that thepatient experiences during the illness, including changesin emotional or mental patterns.\nHomeopaths classify symptoms according to a hier-\narchy of four categories for purposes of acute prescribing:\n• Peculiar symptoms. These are symptoms unique to the\nindividual that do not occur in most persons with theacute disease. Homeopaths make note of peculiarsymptoms because they often help to determine theremedy.\n• Mental and emotional symptoms. These are important\ngeneral symptoms that inform the homeopath about thepatient’s total experience of the disorder.\n• Other general symptoms. These are physical symptoms\nfelt throughout the patient’s body, such as tiredness,changes in appetite, or restlessness.\n• Particular symptoms. Particular symptoms are localized\nin the body; they include such symptoms as nausea,skin rashes ,headache , etc.\nDuring homeopathic case-taking, the practitioner\nwill evaluate the intensity of the patient’s symptoms,assess their depth within the patient’s body, note anypeculiar symptoms, evaluate the modalities of eachsymptom, and make a list of key symptoms to guide theselection of the proper medicine.\nHomeopathic remedies\nThere are several hundred homeopathic remedies.\nHomeopathic medicines are usually formulated fromdiluted or triturated natural substances, including plants,minerals , or even venom from snakes or stinging insects.\nSome remedies may be given in a spray, ointment, orcream, but the most common forms of administration areliquid dilutions and two sizes of pellets, or cylindricaltablets (for triturated remedies). A dose consists of onedrop of liquid; 10–20 small pellets; or 1–3 large pellets.Since the remedies are so dilute, the exact size of the doseis not of primary importance. The frequency of dosing isconsidered critical, however; patients are advised not totake further doses until the first has completed its effect.KEY TERMS\nAcute prescribing —Homeopathic treatment for\nself-limiting illnesses with abrupt onset.\nAllopathy —Conventional medical treatment of\ndisease symptoms that uses substances or tech-niques to oppose or suppress the symptoms.\nLaw of similars —The basic principle of homeo-\npathic medicine that governs the selection of aspecific remedy. It holds that a substance of natur-al origin that produces certain symptoms in ahealthy person will cure those same symptoms ina sick person.\nModalities —The factors and circumstances that\ncause a patient’s symptoms to improve or worsen.\nMother tincture —The first stage in the preparation\nof a homeopathic remedy, made by soaking aplant, animal, or mineral product in a solution ofalcohol.\nPotentization —The process of increasing the\npower of homeopathic preparations by successivedilutions and succussions of a mother tincture.\nSuccussion —The act of shaking diluted homeo-\npathic remedies as part of the process of potenti-zation.\nTrituration —The process of diluting a nonsoluble\nsubstance for homeopathic use by grinding it to afine powder and mixing it with lactose powder.\nHomeopathic remedies can be kept indefinitely with\nproper handling. Proper handling includes storing theremedies in the original bottles and discarding them ifthey become contaminated by sunlight or other intenselight; temperatures over 100°F (37.8°C); vapors fromcamphor, mothballs, or perfume; or from other homeo-pathic remedies being opened in the same room at thesame time.\nPreparations\nCase-taking\nThe first step in acute prescribing is a lengthy inter-\nview with the patient, known as case-taking. In additionto noting the character, location, and severity of thepatient’s symptoms, the homeopath will ask about theirmodalities. The modalities are the circumstances or fac-tors (e.g., weather, time of day, body position, behavioror activity, etc.) that make the symptoms either better or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1657Homeopathic medicine, acute prescribingworse. Case-taking can be done by the patient or a family\nmember as well as by a homeopath.\nSelection and administration of a remedy\nThe choice of a specific remedy is guided by the\npatient’s total symptom profile rather than by the illness.Homeopathic remedies are prescribed according to the lawof similars, which holds that a substance that produces spe-cific symptoms in healthy people cures those symptoms insick people when given in highly diluted forms. For exam-ple, a patient with influenza who is irritable, headachy, andsuffering from joint or muscle pains is likely to be givenbryonia (wild hops), because this plant extract would cause\nthis symptom cluster in a healthy individual.\nPatients are instructed to avoid touching homeopath-\nic medicines with their fingers. The dose can be pouredonto a piece of white paper or the bottle’s cap and tippeddirectly into the mouth. Homeopathic remedies are nottaken with water; patients should not eat or drink any-thing for 15–20 minutes before or after taking the dose.\nPrecautions\nHomeopathic acute prescribing is not recommended\nfor the treatment of chronic conditions requiring consti-tutional prescribing, for severe infections requiringantibiotic treatment, or for conditions requiring majorsurgery. It is also not recommended for the treatment ofmental health problems.\nPersons who are treating themselves with homeo-\npathic remedies should follow professional guidelinesregarding the limitations of home treatment. Most home-opathic home treatment guides include necessary infor-mation regarding symptoms and disorders that requireprofessional attention.\nHomeopathic remedies may lose their potency if\nused at the same time as other products. Some homeo-pathic practitioners recommend the avoidance of mintand mentholated products (toothpastes, candies, chewinggum, mouth rinses), as well as camphor and camphoratedproducts (including eucalyptus and Tiger Balm),patchouli and other essential oils, moth balls, strong per-fumes, aftershaves, scented soaps, stress , x rays, coffee,\nnicotine, recreational drugs (marijuana) and certain ther-apeutic drugs (most notably cortisone and prednisone)during treatment. Patients are also advised to avoid elec-tric blankets and dental work, as these are thought toadversely affect homeopathic therapy. Homeopathicremedies should never be placed near magnets.\nPractitioners caution that high-potency preparations\nshould be used only under the supervision of a homeo-pathic practitioner.Side effects\nHomeopathic medicines are so diluted that some-\ntimes no trace of the original substance can be detected.These medicines are therefore considered non-toxic andgenerally free of harmful side effects. There may, howev-er, be individual reactions to homeopathic medicine.\nAn intensified healing response may occur as treat-\nment begins, which causes symptoms to worsen, but thephenomenon is temporary. In some patients, old symp-toms may re-appear from past conditions from whichrecovery was not complete. Such phenomena are takenas positive indications that the healing process has com-menced.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAs Samuel Hahnemann’s healing system grew in\npopularity during the 1800s, it quickly attracted vehementopposition from the medical and apothecary professions.Since the early 1900s, when the American Medical Asso-ciation and pharmacists waged a battle against it, home-opathy has been neglected and sometimes ridiculed bymainstream medicine. Aside from politics, part of the rea-son for this is that there are some aspects of homeopathywhich have not been completely explained scientifically.For instance, homeopaths have found that the more theydilute and succuss a remedy, the greater effect it seems tohave on the body. Some homeopathic remedies are sodiluted that not even a single molecule of the active agentremains in a solution, yet homeopaths maintain it stillworks; some studies have demonstrated this paradox, yetcannot explain it. Also, homeopathy puts an emphasis onanalyzing symptoms and then applying remedies to thesesymptoms, rather than working by classifying diseases.Thus, some people with the same disease may require dif-ferent homeopathic medicines and treatments. Further-more, conventional medicine strives to find out how med-icines work in the body before they use them; homeopa-thy is less concerned with the intricate biochemistryinvolved than with whether a remedy ultimately worksand heals holistically. For all these reasons, conventionalmedicine claims that homeopathy is not scientific, buthomeopaths are quick to reply that homeopathy has beenscientifically developed and studied for centuries, withmuch documentation and success.\nThere continue to be many studies that affirm the\neffectiveness of homeopathic treatments. Among themost celebrated, the British Medical Journal in 1991\npublished a large analysis of homeopathic treatments thatwere given over the course of 25 years. This projectinvolved over 100 studies of patients with problemsranging from vascular diseases, respiratory problems,infections, stomach problems, allergies, recovery from\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1658Homeopathic medicine, acute prescribingsurgeries, arthritis, trauma, psychological problems, dia-\nbetes, and others. The study found improvement withhomeopathic treatment in most categories of problems,and concluded that the evidence was “sufficient forestablishing homeopathy as a regular treatment for cer-tain indications.”\nIn the United Kingdom and other countries where\nhomeopathy is especially popular, some medical doctorsincorporate aspects of acute prescribing homeopathy intotheir practices. Countries in which homeopathy is popu-lar include France, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, andArgentina. Large homeopathic hospitals exist in Londonand Glasgow, and homeopathic medical centers can befound in India and South America.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCummings, Stephen, and Dana Ullman.

Unlike acutehomeopathic prescribing, constitutional prescribingrefers to the selection and administration of homeopathicpreparations over a period of time for treatment related towhat practitioners call miasmic disorders, those causedby an inherited predisposition to a disease. The termmiasm comes from a Greek word meaning stain or pollu-tion. As in acute prescribing, constitutional prescribing isholistic in that it is intended to treat the patient on theemotional and spiritual levels of his or her being as wellas the physical. Constitutional prescribing is also aimedat eventual cure of the patient, not just suppression orrelief of immediate symptoms.\nPurpose\nHomeopathic physicians seek to cure their patients\non physical, mental, and emotional levels, and each treat-ment is tailored to a patient’s individual needs. Home-\nopathy is generally a safe treatment, as it uses medicines\nin extremely diluted quantities, and there are usuallyminimal side effects. Its non-toxicity makes it a goodchoice for the treatment of children. Another benefit ofhomeopathy is the cost of treatments; homeopathic reme-dies are inexpensive, often a fraction of the cost of con-ventional drugs.\nClassical homeopathy has been used to treat a wide\nrange of diseases and conditions, most of which tend tobe long-term. These include: alcoholism ,allergies ,anxi-\nety, arthritis, asthma , bladder conditions, chronic\nfatigue syndrome , depression, drug dependencies, gas-\ntrointestinal problems, Gulf War sickness, headache ,\nhearing problems, herpes, hypersensitivity, immune dis-orders, insomnia , joint problems, kidney conditions, liver\nproblems, Lyme disease , lower back problems, malaria ,\nmenopause , menstrual problems, migraine, multiple\nsclerosis ,paralysis ,phobias ,shingles , sinus problems,\nskin disorders, repetitive stress injury, rheumatism, verti-\ngo, vision problems, and yeast infections.\nDescription\nOrigins\nHomeopathy was developed during the 1790s by\nSamuel Hahnemann, a German physician. Experimentingon himself with the anti-malarial drug quinine, Hahnemannnoticed that large doses of the medicine actually causedmalaria-like symptoms, while smaller doses cured thesymptoms. From this, he advanced his concept of Similia\nsimilibus curentur , or “let like be cured with like.” Hahne-\nmann then developed an extensive system of medicinebased on this concept.

It is thought that succussion is necessary to transferthe energy of the natural substance to the solution. Inaddition, the potency of the remedy is regarded asincreasing with each dilution. After the tincture has beendiluted to the prescribed potency, the resulting solution isadded to a bottle of sucrose/lactose tablets, which arestored in a cool, dark place.

Rockefeller, Harriet BeecherStowe, William Thackeray, Daniel Webster, and W. B.Yeats. England’s Royal Family has employed homeo-pathic practitioners since the 1830s.\nConstitutional prescribing is based on the patient’s\nsymptom profile and specific aspects of homeopathictheory.\nHomeopathic classification of symptoms\nHomeopathic practitioners use the word symptom in\na more inclusive fashion than traditional medicine. Inhomeopathy, symptoms include any change that thepatient experiences during the illness, including changesin emotional or mental patterns.\nHomeopaths classify symptoms according to a hier-\narchy of four categories:\n• Peculiar symptoms. These are symptoms unique to the\nindividual that do not occur in most persons. Home-opaths make note of peculiar symptoms because theyoften help to determine the remedy.\n• Mental and emotional symptoms. These are important\ngeneral symptoms that inform the homeopath about thepatient’s total experience of the disorder.\n• Other general symptoms. These are physical symptoms\nfelt throughout the patient’s body, such as tiredness,changes in appetite, or restlessness.\n• Particular symptoms. Particular symptoms are localized\nin the body; they include such symptoms as nausea,skin rashes , or headaches.\nMiasms\nHomeopaths regard the patient’s symptom profile as\na systemic manifestation of an underlying chronic disor-der called a miasm. Miasms are serious disturbances ofwhat homeopaths call the patient’s vital force that are\ninherited from parents at the time of conception. Hahne-mann believed that the parents’ basic lifestyle, their emo-tional condition and habitual diet, and even the atmos-pheric conditions at the time of conception would affectthe number and severity of miasms passed on to the child.Hahnemann himself distinguished three miasms: thepsoric, which he considered the most universal source ofchronic disease in humans; the syphilitic; and the sycotic,which he attributed to gonorrhea . Later homeopaths\nidentified two additional miasms, the cancernic and thetuberculinic. The remaining major source of miasms isallopathic medicine. It is thought that specific allopathictreatments—particularly smallpox vaccinations, corti-\nsone preparations, major tranquilizers, and antibiotics—can produce additional layers of miasms in the patient’sconstitution. Constitutional prescribing evaluates the per-son’s current state or miasmic picture, and selects a reme-dy intended to correct or balance that state. The home-opath may prescribe a different remedy for each miasmiclayer over time, but gives only one remedy at a timedirected at the person’s current state. The basic principlegoverning the prescription of each successive remedy isthe law of similars, or “like cures like.”\nHering’s laws of cure\nThe homeopathic laws of cure were outlined by\nConstantine Hering, a student of Hahnemann who cameto the United States in the 1830s. Hering enunciatedthree laws or principles of the patterns of healing that areused by homeopaths to evaluate the effectiveness of spe-cific remedies and the overall progress of constitutionalprescribing:\n• Healing progresses from the deepest parts of the organ-\nism to the external parts. Homeopaths consider the per-son’s mental and emotional dimensions, together withthe brain, heart, and other vital organs, as a person’sdeepest parts. The skin, hands, and feet are consideredthe external parts.\n• Symptoms appear or disappear in the reverse of their\nchronological order of appearance. In terms of constitu-tional treatment, this law means that miasms acquiredlater in life will resolve before earlier ones.\n• Healing proceeds from the upper to the lower parts of\nthe body.\nHealing crises\nHomeopaths use Hering’s laws to explain the\nappearance of so-called healing crises, or aggravations,in the course of homeopathic treatment. It is not unusualfor patients to experience temporary worsening of certainsymptoms after taking their first doses of homeopathic\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1660Homeopathic medicine, constitutional prescribingtreatment. For example, a person might notice that\narthritic pains in the shoulders are better but that thehands feel worse. Hering’s third law would indicate thatthe remedy is working because the symptoms are movingdownward in the body. In constitutional prescribing, aremedy that removes one of the patient’s miasmic layerswill then allow the symptoms of an older miasm toemerge. Thus the patient may find that a physical diseaseis followed by a different set of physical problems or byemotional symptoms.\nPreparations\nThe most important aspects of preparation for con-\nstitutional prescribing are the taking of a completepatient history and careful patient education.\nCase-taking\nHomeopathic case-taking for constitutional pre-\nscribing is similar to that for acute prescribing, but morein-depth. The initial interview generally takes one to twohours. The practitioner is concerned with recording thetotality of the patient’s symptoms and the modalities thatinfluence their severity. Also included are general char-acteristics about the patient and his or her lifestyle choic-es. For example, a practitioner might ask the patient if heor she likes being outside or is generally hot or cold.There is also an emphasis on the patient’s lifetime med-ical history, particularly records of allopathic treatments.KEY TERMS\nAggravation —Another term used by homeopaths\nfor the healing crisis.\nAllopathy —Conventional medical treatment of dis-\nease symptoms that uses substances or techniquesto oppose or suppress the symptoms.\nConstitutional prescribing —Homeopathic treat-\nment for long-term or chronic disorders related toinherited predispositions to certain types of illnesses.\nHealing crisis —A temporary worsening of the\npatient’s symptoms during successive stages ofhomeopathic treatment.\nLaw of similars —The basic principle of homeopath-\nic medicine that governs the selection of a specificremedy. It holds that a substance of natural originthat produces certain symptoms in a healthy personwill cure those same symptoms in a sick person.Laws of cure —A set of three rules used by home-\nopaths to assess the progress of a patient’s recovery.\nMateria medica —In homeopathy, reference books\ncompiled from provings of the various naturalremedies.\nMiasm —In homeopathic theory, a general weak-\nness or predisposition to chronic disease that istransmitted down the generational chain.\nModalities —The factors and circumstances that\ncause a patient’s symptoms to improve or worsen,including weather, time of day, effects of food, andsimilar factors.\nRepertories —Homeopathic reference books con-\nsisting of descriptions of symptoms. The process ofselecting a homeopathic remedy from the patient’ssymptom profile is called repertorizing.\nPatient education\nHomeopaths regard patients as equal partners in the\nprocess of recovery. They will take the time to explainthe theories underlying constitutional prescribing to thepatient as well as taking the history. Patient education isespecially important in constitutional prescribing inorder to emphasize the need for patience with the slow-ness of results and length of treatment, and to minimizethe possibility of self-treatment with allopathic drugs ifthe patient has a healing crisis.\nHomeopathic remedies\nIn constitutional prescribing, one dose of the select-\ned remedy is given. Patients then wait two to six weeksbefore following up with the homeopath, while the bodybegins the healing process. At the follow-up visit, theremedy may be repeated, or a different remedy pre-scribed. The preparation, selection, administration, andstorage of remedies for constitutional prescribing are thesame as for acute prescribing. These procedures aredescribed more fully in the article on acute prescribing.\nPrecautions\nConstitutional homeopathic prescribing is not\nappropriate for diseases or health crises requiring emer-gency treatment, whether medical, surgical, or psychi-atric. In addition, constitutional prescribing should not beself-administered. Although home treatment kits of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1661Homeopathic medicine, constitutional prescribinghomeopathic remedies are available for acute self-limited\ndisorders, the knowledge of homeopathic theory andpractice required for constitutional evaluation is beyondthe scope of most patients.\nPatients are instructed to avoid touching homeopath-\nic medicines with their fingers. The dose can be pouredonto a piece of white paper or the bottle’s cap and tippeddirectly into the mouth. Homeopathic remedies are nottaken with water; patients should not eat or drink any-thing for 15–20 minutes before or after taking the dose.\nHomeopathic remedies may lose their potency if\nused at the same time as other products. Some homeo-pathic practitioners recommend the avoidance of mintand mentholated products (toothpastes, candies, chewinggum, mouth rinses), as well as camphor and camphoratedproducts (including eucalyptus and Tiger Balm),patchouli and other essential oils, moth balls, strong per-fumes, aftershaves, scented soaps, stress, x rays, coffee,nicotine, recreational drugs (marijuana) and certain ther-apeutic drugs (most notably cortisone and prednisone)during treatment.

The primary risksto the patient from constitutional homeopathic treatmentare the symptoms of the healing crisis and individualreactions to homeopathic medicine. The complexity ofconstitutional prescribing requires homeopaths to havedetailed knowledge of the materia medica and the reper-\ntories, and to take careful and extensive case notes.\nAn intensified healing response may occur as treat-\nment begins, which causes symptoms to worsen, but thephenomenon is temporary.

    "content": "Homeopathy\nDefinition\nHomeopathy, or homeopathic medicine, is a holistic\nsystem of treatment that originated in the late eighteenthcentury. The name homeopathy is derived from two Greekwords that mean “like disease.” The system is based on theidea that substances that produce symptoms of sickness inhealthy people will have a curative effect when given invery dilute quantities to sick people who exhibit thosesame symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are believed tostimulate the body’s own healing processes. Homeopathsuse the term “allopathy,” or “different than disease,” todescribe the use of drugs used in conventional medicine tooppose or counteract the symptom being treated.\nPurpose\nHomeopathic physicians seek to cure their patients\non the physical, mental and emotional levels, and eachtreatment is tailored to a patient’s individual needs.Homeopathy is generally a safe treatment, as it usesmedicines in extremely diluted quantities, and there areusually minimal side effects. Its non-toxicity makes it agood choice for the treatment of children. Another bene-fit of homeopathy is the cost of treatments; homeopathicremedies are inexpensive, often a fraction of the cost ofconventional drugs.\nHomeopathic treatment has been shown effective in\ntreating many conditions. Colds and flu may be effective-ly treated with aconite and bryonia. Influenza suffers in\na double-blind study found that they were twice as likelyto recover in 48 hours when they took homeopathicremedies. Studies have been published in British medicaljournals confirming the efficacy of homeopathic treat-ment for rheumatoid arthritis . Homeopathic remedies\nare effective in treating infections, circulatory problems,respiratory problems, heart disease, depression and ner-vous disorders, migraine headaches, allergies , arthritis,\nand diabetes. Homeopathy is a good treatment to explorefor acute and chronic illnesses, particularly if these arefound in the early stages and where there is not severedamage. Homeopathy can be used to assist the healingprocess after surgery or chemotherapy .\nDescription\nOrigins\nHomeopathy was founded by German physician\nSamuel Hahnemann (1755–1843), who was much dis-turbed by the medical system of his time, believing thatits cures were crude and some of its strong drugs andtreatments did more harm than good to patients. Hahne-mann performed experiments on himself using Peruvianbark, which contains quinine, a malaria remedy. He con-\ncluded that in a healthy person, quinine creates the samesymptoms as malaria, including fevers and chills, whichis the reason why it is effective as a remedy. He thenbegan to analyze the remedies available in nature bywhat he called provings. Provings of homeopathic reme-dies are still compiled by dosing healthy adults with vari-ous substances and documenting the results, in terms ofthe dose needed to produce the symptoms and the lengthof the dose’s effectiveness. The provings are collected inlarge homeopathic references called materia medica or\nmaterials of medicine.\nHahnemann formulated these principles of home-\nopathy:\n• Law of Similars (like cures like)\n• Law of the Infinitesimal Dose (The more diluted a rem-\nedy is, the more potent it is.)\n• illness is specific to the individual\nHahnemann’s Law of Similars was based on think-\ning that dated back to Hippocrates in the fourth century\nB.C. It is the same thinking that provided the basis for\nvaccinations created by Edward Jenner and Louis Pas-teur. These vaccines provoke a reaction in the individualthat protects against the actual disease. Allergy treat-ments work the same way. By exposing a person tominute quantities of the allergen, the person’s tolerancelevels are elevated.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1663HomeopathyThe Law of the Infinitesimal Dose has always\ncaused controversy among those outside the field ofhomeopathy. Hahnemann contended that as he dilutedhis remedies with water and alcohol and succussed, orshook, them, the remedies actually worked more effec-tively. In fact, diluted homeopathic remedies may haveno chemical trace of the original substance. Practitionersbelieve that the electromagnetic energy of the originalsubstance is retained in the dilution, but toxic side effectsof the remedy are not. It is this electrochemical “mes-sage” that stimulates the body to heal itself.\nHomeopathic practitioners believe that illness is specif-\nic to an individual. In other words, two people with severeheadaches may not receive the same remedies. The practi-tioner will ask the patient questions about lifestyle, dietaryhabits, and personality traits, as well as specific questionsabout the nature of the headache and when it occurs. This\ninformation gathering is called profiling or case-taking.In the early 1900s, homeopathy was popular in\nAmerica, with over 15 percent of all doctors beinghomeopathic. There were 22 major homeopathic med-ical schools, including Boston University and the Uni-versity of Michigan. However, with the formation of theAmerican Medical Association, which restricted andclosed down alternative practices, homeopathy declinedfor half a century. When the 1960s invigorated back-to-nature trends and distrust of artificial drugs and treat-ments, homeopathy began to grow again dramaticallythrough the next decades. In 1993, The New England\nJournal of Medicine reported that 2.5 million Ameri-\ncans used homeopathic remedies and 800,000 patientsvisited homeopaths in 1990, and it has continued togrow. Homeopathy is much more popular in Europethan in the United States. French pharmacies arerequired to make homeopathic remedies available alongwith conventional medications. Homeopathic hospitalsand clinics are part of the national health system in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1664HomeopathyHomeopathic Remedies That Work\nName Description\nAconite Commonly known as monkshood, aconite is highly toxic.

It is also practiced in India and Israel, among\nother countries.\nA visit to a homeopath can be a different experience\nthan a visit to a regular physician. Surveys have shown thathomeopathic doctors spend much more time during initialconsultations than conventional doctors spend. This isbecause a homeopath does a complete case-taking to get acomplete picture of a person’s general health and lifestyle,as well as particular symptoms, on the physical, mental andemotional levels. Some symptoms can be so subtle that thepatient is not always completely aware of them, and thedoctor must spend time getting to know the patient.\nThe initial visit often includes a long questionnaire\nabout a patient’s medical and family history, and then along interview with the doctor, who prompts the patientwith many questions. Sometimes a homeopathic doctorwill use lab tests to establish a patient’s general level ofhealth. The initial interview usually lasts between oneand two hours.The purpose of homeopathy is the restoration of the\nbody to homeostasis, or healthy balance, which is its nat-ural state. The symptoms of a disease are regarded as thebody’s own defensive attempt to correct its imbalance,rather than as enemies to be defeated. Because a home-opath regards symptoms as positive evidence of thebody’s inner intelligence, he or she will prescribe a reme-dy designed to stimulate this internal curative process,rather than suppress the symptoms.\nIn homeopathy, the curative process extends beyond\nthe relief of immediate symptoms of illness. Healingmay come in many stages, as the practitioner treats lay-ers of symptoms that are remnants of traumas or chronicdisease in the patient’s past. This is part of Hering’s Lawsof Cure, named for Constantine Hering, the father ofhomeopathy in America. Hering believed that healingstarts from the deepest parts of the body to the extremi-ties, and from the upper parts of the body to the lowerparts. Hering’s Laws also state that homeopaths should\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1665Homeopathy\nSAMUEL HAHNEMANN (1755–1843)\nSamuel Christian Hahnemann created and devel-\noped the system called homeopathy. It is also known assimilia similibus curentor or like cures like. Although his\nnew methods initially met with ridicule and criticism, bythe time of his death they were accepted the world overas a result of the great success he had with his new cure.Hahnemann was born in Meissen, Saxony (now part\nof Germany) into a financially challenged middle classfamily. His parents initially educated him at home, wherehis father taught him never to accept anything he learnedwithout first questioning it. He graduated as a physicianat Erlangen in 1779 after studying at Leipzig and Vienna.He was also fluent in English, German, Italian, French,Greek, Arabic, Latin and Hebrew.\nAt age 27 he married his first wife, Johanna Henriette\nKuchler, the daughter of an apothecary, with whom hehad 11 children.\nLiving in poverty, Hahnemann began practicing\nmedicine in 1781 and translating scientific texts to sup-plement his income. However, disillusioned with medi-cine, he eventually gave it up entirely.\nHe discovered the concept of homeopathy when\nconsidering the effect of quinine on malaria, and went onto cure soldiers and then sufferers of a typhus epidemicwith astounding success. He documented his discoveriesin the Organon , a treatise on his work. Homeopathy also\nproved its worth in 1831 when there was an outbreak ofcholera. Hahnemann used homeopathic treatment with a96% success rate, compared to the 41% of allopathicmedicine. He also wrote his Materia Medica Pura.\nIn 1834, Hahnemann met his second wife, Marie\nMelanie d’Hervilly. Despite a great difference in age, theywere happily married until his death in Paris on July 2,1843, at the age of 88.\n(Corbis Corporation. Reproduced by permission.)treat disease symptoms in reverse chronological order,\nfrom the most recent to the oldest, restoring health instages. Sometimes, the patient may feel worse beforefeeling better. This is called a healing crisis.\nWhen prescribing a remedy, homeopaths will match\na patient’s symptoms with the proper remedy in a reper-tory or materia medica that has been compiled through-\nout the history of homeopathy. Classical homeopathsprescribe only one remedy at a time. However, it isbecoming more common, especially in Europe, to usecombination formulas of several remedies for the treat-ment of some combinations of symptoms.\nThe cost of homeopathic care can vary. The cost of\nvisits will be comparable to conventional medicine, withinitial visits ranging from $50 to $300. Non-M.D. home-opaths can charge from $50 to $250. Follow-up visits areless, at about $35 to $100. Homeopathic medicine is signif-icantly cheaper than pharmaceuticals, and most remediescost between $2 and $10. Some doctors provide remedieswithout charge. Homeopaths rarely use lab tests, whichreduces the cost of treatment further. In general, homeopa-thy is much more economical than conventional medicine.In 1991, the French government did a study on the cost ofhomeopathic medicine, and found that it costs half as muchto treat patients, considering all costs involved.\nWhen homeopaths are licensed professionals, most\ninsurance companies will pay for their fees. Consumersshould consult their insurance policies to determine indi-vidual regulations. Insurance usually will not cover home-opathic medicine, because it is sold over-the-counter.\nPrecautions\nAlthough homeopathic remedies sometimes use\nsubstances that are toxic, they are diluted and prescribedin non-toxic doses. Remedies should be prescribed by ahomeopathic practitioner. Those preparing to take home-opathic remedies should also avoid taking antidotes , sub-\nstances which homeopathic doctors believe cancel theeffects of their remedies. These substances include alco-hol, coffee, prescription drugs, peppermint (in toothpasteand mouthwash), camphor (in salves and lotions), andvery spicy foods. Homeopathic medicine should also behandled with care, and should not be touched with thehands or fingers, which can contaminate it.\nSide effects\nA homeopathic aggravation sometimes occurs during\ninitial treatment with homeopathic remedies. This meansthat symptoms can temporarily worsen during the processof healing. Although this is usually mild, the aggravationcan sometimes be severe. Homeopaths see aggravation asa positive sign that the remedy is a good match for the\npatient’s symptoms. The healing crisis, which happenswhen the patient is undergoing treatment for layers ofsymptoms, may also cause the patient to feel worse beforefeeling better. Some patients can experience emotionaldisturbances like weeping or depression, if suppressedemotional problems led to the illness in the first place.\nResearch and general acceptance\nSince the early 1900s, when the American Medical\nAssociation and pharmacists waged a battle against it,homeopathy has been neglected and sometimes ridiculedby mainstream medicine. Aside from politics, part of thereason for this is that there are some aspects of homeopa-thy which have not been completely explained scientifical-ly. For instance, homeopaths have found that the morethey dilute and succuss a remedy, the greater effect itseems to have on the body. Some homeopathic remediesare so diluted that not even a single molecule of the activeagent remains in a solution, yet it still works; studies havedemonstrated this paradox, yet can’t explain it. Also,homeopathy puts an emphasis on analyzing symptoms andthen applying remedies to these symptoms, rather thanworking by classifying diseases. Thus, some people withthe same disease may require different homeopathic medi-cines and treatments. Furthermore, conventional medicinestrives to find out how medicines work in the body beforethey use them; homeopathy is less concerned with theintricate biochemistry involved than with whether a reme-dy ultimately works and heals holistically. For all thesereasons, conventional medicine claims that homeopathy isnot scientific, but homeopaths are quick to reply thathomeopathy has been scientifically developed and studiedfor centuries, with much documentation and success.\nThere continue to be many studies that affirm the\neffectiveness of homeopathic treatments. Among the mostcelebrated, the British Medical Journal in 1991 published\na large analysis of homeopathic treatments that weregiven over the course of 25 years. This project involvedover 100 studies of patients with problems ranging fromvascular diseases, respiratory problems, infections, stom-ach problems, allergies, recovery from surgeries, arthritis,trauma, psychological problems, diabetes, and others.The study found improvement with homeopathic treat-ment in most categories of problems, and concluded thatthe evidence was “sufficient for establishing homeopathyas a regular treatment for certain indications.”\nResources\nBOOKS\nCastro, Miranda.

Necator americanus and Ancy-\nlostoma duodenale have similar life cycles and similar\nmethods of causing illness.

The\nfemales produce about 10,000–20,000 eggs per day. Theseeggs are passed out of the host’s body in feces. The eggsenter the soil, where they incubate. After about 48 hours,the immature larval form hatches out of the eggs. Theselarvae take about six weeks to develop into the mature lar-val form that is capable of causing human infection. Ifexposed to human skin at this point (usually bare feetwalking in the dirt or bare hands digging in the dirt), thelarvae will bore through the skin and ride through thelymph circulation to the right side of the heart. The larvaeare then pumped into the lungs. There they bore into thetiny air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. Their presence withinthe lungs usually causes enough irritation to producecoughing. The larvae are coughed up into the throat andmouth, and are then swallowed and passed into the smallintestine. It is within the intestine that they develop intothe adult worm, producing illness in their human host.\nAncylostoma duodenale is found primarily in the\nMediterranean, the Middle East, and throughout Asia.Necator americanus is common in tropical areas includ-\ning Asia, parts of the Americas, and throughout Africa.Research suggests that at least 25% of all people in theworld have hookworm disease. In the United States,700,000 people are believed to be infected with hook-worms at any given time.\nCauses and symptoms\nHookworms cause trouble for their human host\nwhen the worms attach their mouths to the lining of thesmall intestine and suck the person’s blood.\nAn itchy, slightly raised rash called “ground itch”\nmay appear around the area where the larvae first boredthrough the skin. The skin in this area may become redand swollen. This lasts for several days and commonlyoccurs between the toes.\nWhen the larvae are in the lungs, the patient may\nhave a fever ,cough , and some wheezing . Some people,\nhowever, have none of these symptoms.\nOnce established within the intestine, the adult\nworms can cause abdominal pain , decreased appetite,\ndiarrhea , and weight loss. Most importantly, the worms\nsuck between 0.03–0.2 ml of blood per day. When aworm moves from one area of the intestine to another, itdetaches its mouth from the intestinal lining, leaving anirritated area that may continue to bleed for some time.This results in even further blood loss. A single adultworm can live for up to 14 years in a patient’s intestine.Over time, the patient’s blood loss may be very signifi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1667Hookworm diseaseKEY TERMS\nAlveoli —The small air sacs clustered at the ends\nof the bronchioles, in the lungs in which oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange takes place.\nAnemia —Any condition where the oxygen-carry-\ning capacity of the red blood cells is reduced;symptoms often include fatigue.\nHost —The organism (like a human) in which\nanother infecting organism (like a worm) is living.\nLarva —An immature form of an organism, occur-\nring early in that organism’s development.\ncant. Anemia is the most serious complication of hook-\nworm disease, progressing over months or years. Chil-dren are particularly harmed by such anemia, and cansuffer from heart problems, mental retardation , slowed\ngrowth, and delayed sexual development. In infants,hookworm disease can be deadly.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of hookworm disease involves collecting a\nstool sample for examination under a microscope. Hook-worm eggs have a characteristic appearance. Counting theeggs in a specific amount of feces allows the healthcareprovider to estimate the severity of the infection.\nTreatment\nMinor infections are often left untreated, especially\nin areas where hookworm is very common. If treatmentis required, the doctor will prescribe a three-day dose ofmedication. One to two weeks later, another stool samplewill be taken to see if the infection is still present.\nAnemia is treated with iron supplements. In severe\ncases, blood transfusion may be necessary. Two medica-\ntions, pyrantel pamoate and mebendazole, are frequentlyused with good results.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for patients with hookworm disease is\ngenerally good. However, reinfection rates are extremelyhigh in countries with poor sanitation.Prevention\nPrevention of hookworm disease involves improving\nsanitation and avoiding contact with soil in areas withhigh rates of hookworm infection. Children should berequired to wear shoes when playing outside in suchareas, and people who are gardening should wear gloves.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPlorde, James J. “Hookworms.” In Sherris Medical Microbiol-\nogy: An Introduction to Infectious Diseases. 3rd ed.

Reproduced by permis-\nsion.)decline or lack of natural hormones produced in a\nwoman’s body. HRT is sometimes referred to as estrogenreplacement therapy (ERT), because the first medicationsthat were used in the 1960s for female hormone replace-ment were estrogen compounds.\nEstrogens\nIn order to understand how HRT works and the con-\ntroversies surrounding it, women should know that thereare different types of estrogen medications commonlyprescribed in the United States and Europe. These drugsare given in a variety of prescription strengths and meth-ods of administration. There are at present three estrogencompounds used in Western countries. Only the first twoare readily available in the United States.\n• Estrone. Estrone is the form of estrogen present in\nwomen after menopause . It is available as tablets under\nthe brand name Ogen. The most commonly prescribedestrogen in the United States, Premarin, is a so-calledconjugated estrogen that is a mixture of estrone andother estrogens.\n• Estradiol. This is the form of estrogen naturally present\nin premenopausal women. It is available as tablets(Estrace), skin patches (Estraderm), or vaginal creams(Estrace).\n• Estriol. Estriol is a weaker form of estrogen produced\nby the breakdown of other forms of estrogen in thebody. This is the form of estrogen most commonlygiven in Europe, under the brand name Estriol. It is theonly form that is thought not to cause cancer .\nIn addition to pills taken by mouth, skin patches, and\nvaginal creams, estrogen preparations can be given byinjection or by pellets implanted under the skin. Estrogenimplants, however, are used less and less frequently.\nProgestins\nMost HRT programs include progestin treatment\nwith estrogen compounds. Progestins—sometimes calledprogestogens—are synthetic forms of progesterone thatare given to reduce the possibility that estrogen by itselfwill cause cancer of the uterus. Progestins are commonlyprescribed under the brand names Provera and Depo-Provera. Other common brand names are Norlutate, Nor-lutin, and Aygestin.\nEstrogen/testosterone combinations\nWomen’s ovaries secrete small amounts of a male\nsex hormone (testosterone) throughout their lives.Women who have had both ovaries removed by surgeryare sometimes given testosterone along with estrogen aspart of HRT. Combinations of these hormones are avail-able as tablets under the brand name Estratest or as vagi-\nnal creams. Women who cannot take estrogens can use1% testosterone cream by itself for problems with vagi-nal soreness.\nEstrogen/tranquilizer combinations\nThere are several medications that combine estrogen\nwith a tranquilizer like chlordiazepoxide (sold under thetrade name Menrium) or meprobamate (sold under thetrade name PMB). Many doctors warn against thesecombination drugs because the tranquilizers can behabit-forming.\nPurpose\nHRT has two primary purposes: preventive treat-\nment against osteoporosis and heart disease; and relief\nof physical symptoms associated with menopause.\nMenopausal symptoms\nWomen in midlife enter a stage of development\ncalled menopause, when their menstrual periods becomeirregular and finally stop. The early phase of this transi-tion is called the perimenopause. In the United States, theaverage age at menopause is presently 50 or 51, but somewomen begin menopause as early as 40 and others as lateas 55. It can take as long as 10 years for a woman tocomplete the process. Women who have had their ovariesremoved surgically are said to have undergone surgicalmenopause.\nDoctors have not always agreed on definitions of the\nmenopause. Some use age as the baseline. Others definemenopause as the point when a woman has had no men-strual periods for a full calendar year. Still others definemenopause as the end of ovulation. It is not always clear,however, when a woman has had her last period or whenshe has stopped ovulating. In addition, women who takeoral contraceptives can have breakthrough bleeding long\nafter they have stopped ovulating. As a result, some doc-tors now measure the level of follicle-stimulating hor-mone (FSH) in a woman’s blood to estimate whether thewoman has entered menopause. During perimenopause,the FSH levels in a woman’s blood rise as her bodyattempts to stimulate the release of ripe ova. An FSH levelover 40 is considered an indicator of menopause.\nDuring the menopausal transition, the levels of estro-\ngen in the woman’s body drop. The lowered estrogen levelis responsible for a group of symptoms that include hotflashes (or flushes), weight gain, changes in skin texture,mood swings, heart palpitations , sleep disturbances, a\nneed to urinate more frequently, and loss of sexual desire.The estrogen that is given in HRT can eliminate hot flash-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1669Hormone replacement therapyes, night sweats, lack of vaginal lubrication, and urinary\ntract problems. HRT will not prevent weight gain or wrin-kles. It also does not cure depression in most women.\nPreventive care\nHRT is recommended by many doctors on the\ngrounds that estrogen replacement helps to protectwomen against two serious midlife health problems.\nOSTEOPOROSIS. Osteoporosis is a disorder in which\nthe bones become more brittle and more easily fractured.It is a particular problem for postmenopausal womenbecause the lower levels of estrogen in the blood lead toweakening of the bone. About 25% of Caucasian womenwill develop severe osteoporosis; Asian women have aslightly lower risk level; Latino and African Americanwomen are least at risk.\nIn addition to race, there are other factors that put\nsome women at higher risk of developing osteoporosis.Women in any of the following groups should take boneloss into account when considering HRT:\n• family history of osteoporosis\n• menopause before age 40• kidney disease and dialysis• thin body build or being underweight• history of colitis, Crohn’s disease , or chronic diarrhea\n• thyroid medications• childlessness\n• chronic use of antacids\n• lack of exercise\n• poor food choices, including high salt intake, lack of\nvitamin D, high caffeine consumption, and low calci-\num intake\n•smoking and alcohol abuse\n• cortisone therapy\nHEART DISEASE. Heart disease is a major health con-\ncern of women in midlife. It is the leading cause of death\nin women over 60. The primary disorders of the circula-tory system in postmenopausal women are stroke ,\nhypertension , and coronary artery disease . Current\nstudies of women on HRT do not yield a completelyclear picture. In particular, although estrogen given with-out progestins has been shown to offer some protectionagainst heart disease, the effect of progestins in offsettingthe benefits of estrogen complicates the research find-ings. It seems likely that estrogen levels are only part ofthe picture in evaluating a woman’s risk of heart disease.\nThe major factors that are known to increase the risk\nof heart disease include:• history of smoking\n• being overweight\n• high-fat diets\n• alcohol abuse\n• family history of heart disease\n• high blood pressure• high blood cholesterol levels\n• diabetes.\nLess important risk factors include being African\nAmerican, having a sedentary lifestyle, undergoingmenopause before age 45, and having high levels of fam-ily- or job-related stress .\nPrecautions\nMedical conditions\nCertain groups of women should not use HRT. They\ninclude women with:\n•breast cancer\n• cancer of the uterus\n• abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been diagnosed\n• high blood pressure that rises when HRT is used\n• liver disease•gallstones or diseases of the gallbladder\nDrug interactions\nHRT can interact with other prescription medica-\ntions that a woman may be taking. Women who are tak-ing corticosteroids , drugs to slow the clotting of blood\n(anticoagulants), and rifampin should ask their doctorabout possible interactions.\nCombining estrogens with certain other medicines\ncan cause liver damage. Among the drugs that may causeliver damage when taken with estrogens are:\n• acetaminophen (Tylenol), when used in high doses over\nlong periods\n• anabolic steroids such as nandrolone (Anabolin) or\noxymetholone (Anadrol)\n• medicine for infections• antiseizure medicines such as divalproex (Depakote),\nvalproic acid (Depakene), or phenytoin (Dilantin)\n• antianxiety drugs, including chlorpromazine (Tho-\nrazine), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and thiori-dazine (Mellaril).\nIn addition, estrogens may interfere with the effects\nof bromocriptine (Parlodel), used to treat Parkinson’s\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1670Hormone replacement therapydisease and other conditions; they may also increase the\nchance of toxic side effects when taken with cyclosporine(Sandimmune), a drug that helps prevent organ transplantrejection.\nDescription\nHRT medications come in several different forms,\nincluding tablets, stick-on patches, injections, and creamsthat are worn inside the vagina. The form prescribeddepends on the purpose of the hormone replacement ther-apy. Women who want relief from vaginal dryness, forexample, would be given a cream or vaginal ring. Womenusing HRT to relieve hot flashes or to prevent osteoporo-sis and heart disease often prefer oral medications orpatches. All HRT medications used in the United Statesare available only with a doctor’s prescription.\nHRT treatment regimens\nOne of the complications of HRT is the number of\ntreatment options, including combinations of types ofestrogen; dosage levels; forms of administration; andwhether or not progestins are used with the estrogen tooffset the risk of uterine cancer. This variety, however,means that a woman who wants to use HRT while mini-mizing side effects can try different forms of medicationor dosage schedules when she consults her doctor. It isvital, however, for women to follow their doctor’s direc-\ntions exactly and not change dosages themselves.\nAt present, women who are taking a combination of\nestrogens and progestins are placed on one of threedosage schedules:\n• Estrogen pills taken daily from the first through the\n25th day of each month, with a progestin pill takendaily during the last 10–14 days of the cycle. Bothdrugs are then stopped for the next five to six days toallow the uterus to shed its lining.\n• Estrogen pills taken on a daily basis with low-dose\nprogestin pills, also on a daily basis. Both medicationsare taken continuously with no days off.\n• Estrogen pills and low-dose progestins taken on a daily\nbasis for five days each week, with both medicationsstopped on the last two days of each week.\nControversies over HRT\nIt is important to know that there is still considerable\ndisagreement over the advantages and disadvantages ofHRT. Further research is ongoing and intensive concern-ing the benefits and/or risks.\nINCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER. The most\nimportant controversy over HRT is whether it increasesa woman’s risk of developing breast cancer. Some stud-ies not only indicate a connection, but suggest that the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1671Hormone replacement therapy\nProtective film\nHormone layerControl membraneAdhesive layerEstrogen replacement patch\nEstrogen replacement patches adhere to a patient’s skin and slowly administer estrogen to the body. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)risk of breast cancer rises with the length of time that a\nwoman has been taking HRT. According to an Ameri-can study published in June 1998, the risk of breast can-cer increases by 2.3% for each year that a woman takesHRT. A Swedish study found that the risk of breast can-cer doubled after six years of HRT, which agrees withAmerican findings that risk is connected to length oftreatment.\nTIMING AND LENGTH OF TREATMENT. One of the\ndisagreements about HRT concerns the best time tobegin using it. Some doctors think that women shouldbegin using HRT while they are still in perimenopause.Others think that there is no harm in a woman’s waitingto decide. Either way, the question of timing means that awoman should keep track of changes in her periods andother signs of perimenopause so that her doctor can eval-uate her readiness for HRT.\nThe other question of timing concerns length of\ntreatment. Some women use HRT only as long as theyneed it to relieve the symptoms of menopause. Othersregard it as a lifetime commitment because of concernsabout osteoporosis. One study found that the averagelength of time that women stay on HRT is 23 months.KEY TERMS\nDilation and curettage (D & C) —A surgical proce-\ndure in which the patient’s cervix is widened (dilat-ed) and the endometrium is scraped with a scoop-shaped instrument (curette).\nEstrogen —The primary sex hormone that controls\nnormal sexual development in females.

Much of the disagree-\nment about unwanted side effects from HRT concerns therole of progestins in the estrogen/progestin combinationsthat are commonly prescribed. Many women who findthat estrogen relieves hot flashes and other symptoms ofmenopause have the opposite experience with progestin.Progestin frequently causes moodiness, depression, sorebreasts, weight gain, and severe headaches.\nOther treatment approaches\nWomen who are uncertain about HRT, or who should\nnot take estrogens, should know about other treatmentoptions, such as natural progesterone. Progestins, whichare synthetic hormones, were developed because naturalprogesterone cannot be absorbed in the body when takenin pill form. A new technique called micronization hasmade it possible for women to take natural progesteroneby mouth. Many women prefer this form of hormonebecause it lacks the side effects of the synthetic progestinseven though it is somewhat more expensive. The mostcommon form of natural progesterone is called Prometri-um and it is available by prescription only. Another formof natural progesterone consists of the hormone suspend-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1672Hormone replacement therapyed in vitamin E oil. It is absorbed through the skin and is\navailable without a prescription.\nAlternative therapies are also available. Many main-\nstream as well as alternative practitioners recommendchanges in diet and nutrition as helpful during\nmenopause. Women who limit their intake of fats andsalts, increase their use of fresh fruits and vegetables, cutout smoking, and drink only in moderation often findthat these dietary changes help them feel better. Natur-opaths typically recommend vitamin and mineral supple-ments for general well-being as well as for relief fromhot flashes and leg cramps. In addition, herbal teas andtonics are helpful to some women in treating water reten-tion, insomnia ,constipation , or moodiness.\nWomen who find menopause emotionally stressful\nbecause of negative social attitudes toward older womenare often helped by meditation ,biofeedback , therapeutic\nmassage, and other relaxation techniques. Yoga and tai\nchiprovide physical exercise as well as stress reduction .\nExercise is an important safeguard against osteoporosis.\nPreparation\nWomen who are considering HRT should visit their\ndoctor for a series of tests to make sure that they do nothave any serious health disorders. They should have aPap smear and breast examination to rule out cancer.They should also have a urinalysis ,a  bone density\ntest, and blood tests to measure their red blood cell\nlevel, blood sugar level, cholesterol level, and liver andthyroid function.\nIn addition to these tests, most doctors will also give\na progesterone challenge test. It consists of doses ofprogesterone given over a 10-day period to see if thewoman is still producing her own estrogen. If she bleedsat the end of the test, she is still producing estrogen.\nAftercare\nAftercare is a very important part of HRT. Women\nwho are taking HRT will need to see their doctor morefrequently. At a minimum, they should be checked twicea year with a blood pressure test and breast examination.They should have a complete physical on a yearly basis.Any abnormal bleeding must be reported to the doctor assoon as it occurs. The doctor will need to order a tissuebiopsy or dilation and curettage (D & C) in order to ruleout cancer of the uterus.\nWomen who are taking HRT and decide to stop\nshould taper their dosage over a period of severalmonths rather than discontinuing abruptly. A gradualreduction minimizes the possibility of hot flashes andother side effects.Risks\nThe short-term risks associated with HRT include a\nrange of physical side effects. Common side effectsinclude fluid retention, bloating, weight gain, sorebreasts, leg cramps, vaginal discharges, migraineheadaches, hair loss, nausea and vomiting ,acne ,\ndepression, shortness of breath , and dizziness . Poten-\ntially serious side effects include tissue growths in theuterus (fibroids), gallstones, thrombophlebitis ,hypo-\nglycemia , abnormal growth (hyperplasia) of uterine tis-\nsue, thyroid disorders, high blood pressure, and cancer.\nNormal results\nNormal results of HRT include relief of hot flashes,\nnight sweats, vaginal dryness, and urinary symptomsassociated with menopause.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCompton, Madonna Sophia, MA.

Infections acquired in a hos-pital are also called nosocomial infections.\nDescription\nAbout 5–10% of patients admitted to hospitals in the\nUnited States develop a nosocomial infection. Hospital-acquired infections are usually related to a procedure ortreatment used to diagnose or treat the patient’s illness orinjury. About 25% of these infections can be preventedby healthcare workers taking proper precautions whencaring for patients.\nHospital-acquired infections can be caused by bacte-\nria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. These microorganismsmay already be present in the patient’s body or may comefrom the environment, contaminated hospital equipment,healthcare workers, or other patients. Depending on thecausal agents involved, an infection may start in any partof the body. A localized infection is limited to a specificpart of the body and has local symptoms. For example, ifa surgical wound in the abdomen becomes infected, thearea of the wound becomes red, hot, and painful. A gener-alized infection is one that enters the bloodstream andcauses general systemic symptoms such as fever , chills,\nlow blood pressure, or mental confusion.\nHospital-acquired infections may develop from sur-\ngical procedures, catheters placed in the urinary tract orblood vessels, or from material from the nose or mouththat is inhaled into the lungs. The most common types ofhospital-acquired infections are urinary tract infections(UTIs), pneumonia , and surgical wound infections.\nCauses and symptoms\nAll hospitalized patients are susceptible to contract-\ning a nosocomial infection. Some patients are at greaterrisk than others—young children, the elderly, and per-sons with compromised immune systems are more likelyto get an infection. Other risk factors for getting a hospi-tal-acquired infection are a long hospital stay, the use ofindwelling catheters, failure of healthcare workers towash their hands, and overuse of antibiotics .\nAny type of invasive procedure can expose a patient\nto the possibility of infection. Common causes of hospi-tal-acquired infections include:\n• Urinary bladder catheterization• Respiratory procedures• surgery and wounds\n• intravenous (IV) procedures\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common\ntype of hospital-acquired infection. Most hospital-acquired UTIs happen after urinary catheterization .\nCatheterization is the placement of a catheter through theurethra into the urinary bladder. This procedure is doneto empty urine from the bladder, relieve pressure in thebladder, measure urine in the bladder, put medicine intothe bladder, or for other medical reasons.\nThe healthy urinary bladder is sterile, which means\nit doesn’t have any bacteria or other microorganisms init. There may be bacteria in or around the urethra butthey normally cannot enter the bladder. A catheter canpick up bacteria from the urethra and allow them into thebladder, causing an infection to start.\nBacteria from the intestinal tract are the most com-\nmon type to cause UTIs. Patients with poorly functioningimmune systems or who are taking antibiotics are also atrisk for infection by a fungus called Candida .\nPneumonia is the second most common type of hospi-\ntal-acquired infection. Bacteria and other microorganismsare easily brought into the throat by respiratory procedurescommonly done in the hospital. The microorganismscome from contaminated equipment or the hands of healthcare workers. Some of these procedures are respiratoryintubation, suctioning of material from the throat andmouth, and mechanical ventilation. The introducedmicroorganisms quickly colonize the throat area. Thismeans that they grow and form a colony, but have not yetcaused an infection. Once the throat is colonized, it is easyfor a patient to inhale the microorganisms into the lungs.\nPatients who cannot cough or gag very well are\nmost likely to inhale colonized microorganisms into theirlungs. Some respiratory procedures can keep patientsfrom gagging or coughing. Patients who are sedated orwho lose consciousness may also be unable to cough orgag. The inhaled microorganisms grow in the lungs andcause an infection that can lead to pneumonia.\nSurgical procedures increase a patient’s risk of get-\nting an infection in the hospital. Surgery directly invadesthe patient’s body, giving bacteria a way into normallysterile parts of the body. An infection can be acquiredfrom contaminated surgical equipment or from health-care workers. Following surgery, the surgical wound canbecome infected. Other wounds from trauma, burns , and\nulcers may also become infected.\nMany hospitalized patients need a steady supply of\nmedications or nutrients delivered to their bloodstream.An intravenous (IV) catheter is placed in a vein and themedication or other substance is infused into the vein.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1674Hospital-acquired infectionsBacteria transmitted from the surroundings, contaminat-\ned equipment, or healthcare workers’ hands can invadethe site where the catheter is inserted. A local infectionmay develop in the skin around the catheter. The bacteriacan also enter the blood through the vein and cause ageneralized infection. The longer a catheter is in place,the greater the risk of infection.\nOther hospital procedures that put patients at risk for\nnosocomial infection are gastrointestinal procedures,obstetric procedures, and kidney dialysis .\nFever is often the first sign of infection. Other symp-\ntoms and signs of infection are rapid breathing, mentalconfusion, low blood pressure, reduced urine output, anda high white blood cell count.\nPatients with a UTI may have pain when urinating\nand blood in the urine. Symptoms of pneumonia mayinclude difficulty breathing and coughing. A localizedinfection causes swelling, redness, and tenderness at thesite of infection.\nDiagnosis\nAn infection is suspected any time a hospitalized\npatient develops a fever that cannot be explained by aknown illness. Some patients, especially the elderly, maynot develop a fever. In these patients, the first signs ofinfection may be rapid breathing or mental confusion.\nDiagnosis of a hospital-acquired infection is based on:\n• symptoms and signs of infection\n• examination of wounds and catheter entry sites\n• review of procedures that might have led to infection• laboratory test results\nA complete physical examination is conducted in\norder to locate symptoms and signs of infection. Woundsand the skin where catheters have been placed are exam-ined for redness, swelling, or the presence of pus or anabscess . The physician reviews the patient’s record of\nprocedures performed in the hospital to determine if anyposed a risk for infection.\nLaboratory tests are done to look for signs of infec-\ntion. A complete blood count can reveal if the white\nblood cell count is high. White blood cells are immunesystem cells that increase in numbers in response to aninfection. White blood cells or blood may be present inthe urine when there is a UTI.\nCultures of blood, urine, sputum, other body fluids,\nor tissue are done to look for infectious microorganisms.If an infection is present, it is necessary to identify themicroorganism so the patient can be treated with the cor-rect medication. A sample of the fluid or tissue is placedin a special medium that bacteria will grow in. OtherKEY TERMS\nAbscess —A localized pocket of pus at a site of\ninfection.\nCandida —A yeast-like fungal organism.\nCatheter —A thin, hollow tube inserted into the\nbody at specific points in order to inject or with-draw fluids from the body.\nGeneralized infection —An infection that has\nentered the bloodstream and has general systemicsymptoms such as fever, chills, and low bloodpressure.\nLocalized infection —An infection that is limited to\na specific part of the body and has local symptoms.\nNosocomial infection —An infection acquired in\nthe hospital.\ntests can also be done on blood and body fluids to look\nfor and identify bacteria, fungi, viruses, or other microor-ganisms responsible for an infection.\nIf a patient has symptoms suggestive of pneumonia,\na chest x ray is done to look for infiltrates of white blood\ncells and other inflammatory substances in the lung tis-sue. Samples of sputum can be studied with a micro-scope or cultured to look for bacteria or fungi.\nTreatment\nOnce the source of the infection is identified, the\npatient is treated with antibiotics or other medication thatkills the responsible microorganism. Many differentantibiotics are available that are effective against differ-ent bacteria. Some common antibiotics are penicillin,cephalosporins ,tetracyclines , and erythromycin. More\nand more commonly, some types of bacteria are becom-ing resistant to the standard antibiotic treatments. Whenthis happens, a different, more powerful antibiotic mustbe used. Two strong antibiotics that have been effectiveagainst resistant bacteria are vancomycin and imipenem,although some bacteria are developing resistance to theseantibiotics as well.\nFungal infections are treated with antifungal med-\nications. Examples of these are amphotericin B, nystatin,ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole.\nA number of antiviral drugs have been developed\nthat slow the growth or reproduction of viruses. Acy-clovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, and amantadine are exam-ples of antiviral medications.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1675Hospital-acquired infectionsPrognosis\nHospital-acquired infections are serious illnesses that\ncause death in about 1% of cases. Rapid diagnosis and\nidentification of the responsible microorganism is neces-sary, so treatment can be started as soon as possible.\nPrevention\nHospitals and other healthcare facilities have developed\nextensive infection control programs to prevent nosocomi-\nal infections. These programs focus on identifying high riskprocedures and other possible sources of infection. Highrisk procedures such as urinary catheterization should beperformed only when necessary and catheters should be leftin for as little time as possible. Medical instruments andequipment must be properly sterilized to ensure they are notcontaminated. Frequent handwashing by healthcare workersand visitors is necessary to avoid passing infectiousmicroorganisms to hospitalized patients.\nAntibiotics should only be used when necessary.\nUse of antibiotics creates favorable conditions for infec-tion with the fungal organism Candida . Overuse of\nantibiotics is also responsible for the development ofbacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAndreoli, T. E., J. C. Bennet, C. C. Carpenter, and F.

    "title": "Human-potential movement",
    "content": "Human-potential movement\nDefinition\nThe human-potential movement is a term used for\nhumanistic psychotherapies that first became popular inthe 1960s and early 1970s. The movement emphasized thedevelopment of individuals through such techniques asencounter groups, sensitivity training, and primal therapy.Although the human-potential movement and humanistictherapy are sometimes used as synonyms, in reality,humanistic therapy preceded the human-potential move-ment and provided the movement’s theoretical base.Humanistic therapy flourished in the 1940s and 1950s. Itstheorists were mostly psychologists rather than medicaldoctors. They included Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow,Everett Shostrom, Carl Rogers, and Fritz Perls.\nThe human-potential movement and humanistic\ntherapy is distinguished by the following emphases:\n• A concern for what is uniquely human rather than what\nhumans share with other animals.\n• A focus on each person’s open-ended growth rather\nthan reshaping individuals to fit society’s demands.\n• An interest in the here-and-now rather than in a person’s\nchildhood history or supposed unconscious conflicts.\n• A holistic approach concerned with all levels of human\nbeing and functioning—not just the intellectual—including creative and spiritual functioning.\n• A focus on psychological health rather than disturbance.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of humanistic therapy is to allow a per-\nson to make full use of his or her personal capacitiesleading to self-actualization. Self-actualization requiresthe integration of all the components of one’s unique per-sonality. These elements or components of personalityinclude the physical, emotional, intellectual, behavioral,and spiritual. The marks of a self-actualized person arematurity, self-awareness, and authenticity. Humanistictherapists think that most people—not only those withobvious problems—can benefit from opportunities forself-development. Humanistic therapy uses both individ-ual and group approaches.\nPrecautions\nPsychotic patients, substance abusers, and persons\nwith severe personality disorders or disorders of\nimpulse control may not be appropriate for treatmentwith humanistic methods.\nDescription\nHumanistic approaches to individual treatment usu-\nally follow the same format as other forms of outpatientcounseling. Therapists may be medical doctors, nurses,psychologists, social workers, or clergy. Humanisticgroup treatment formats are flexible, and a wide range of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1676Human-potential movementtreatment methods are used, ranging from encounter\ngroups and therapy groups to assertiveness training andconsciousness-raising groups. In addition, the humanistictradition has fostered the publication of self-help booksfor people interested in psychological self-improvement.\nRisks\nThe chief risks include the reinforcement of self-\ncentered tendencies in some patients and the dangersresulting from encounter groups led by persons withoutadequate training. Poorly led encounter groups can betraumatic to persons with low tolerance for confrontationor “uncovering” of private issues.\nNormal results\nThe anticipated outcome of humanistic therapy is a\ngreater degree of personal wholeness, self-acceptance,and exploration of one’s potential. In group treatment,participants are expected to grow in interpersonal empa-thy and relationship skills. However, there have been fewcontrolled studies to determine the reasonableness ofthese expectations.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLasch, Christopher.

    "title": "Human bite infections",
    "content": "Human bite infections\nDefinition\nHuman bite infections are potentially serious infec-\ntions caused by rapid growth of bacteria in broken skin.\nDescription\nBites—animal and human—are responsible for\nabout 1% of visits to emergency rooms. Bite injuries aremore common during the summer months.\nClosed-fist injury\nIn adults, the most common form of human bite is\nthe closed-fist injury, sometimes called the “fight bite.”These injuries result from the breaking of the skin overthe knuckle joint when a person’s fist strikes someone’steeth during a fight.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn children, bite infections result either from acci-\ndents during play or from fighting. Most infected bites inadults result from fighting.\nThe infection itself can be caused by a number of\nbacteria that live in the human mouth. These includestreptococci, staphylococci, anaerobic organisms, andEikenella corrodens . Infections that begin less than 24\nhours after the injury are usually produced by a mixtureof organisms and can cause a necrotizing infection (caus-ing the death of a specific area of tissue), in which tissue\nis rapidly destroyed. If a bite is infected, the skin will besore, red, swollen, and warm to the touch.\nDiagnosis\nIn most cases the diagnosis is made by an emer-\ngency room doctor on the basis of the patient’s history.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1677Human bite infectionsBecause the human mouth contains a variety of bac-\nteria, the doctor will order a laboratory culture in order tochoose the most effective antibiotic.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves surgical attention as well as med-\nications. Because bites cause puncturing and tearing ofskin rather than clean-edged cuts, they must be carefullycleansed. The doctor will wash the wound with waterunder high pressure and debride it. Debridement is the\nremoval of dead tissue and foreign objects from a wound\nto prevent infection. If the bite is a closed-fist injury, thedoctor will look for torn tendons or damage to the spacesbetween the joints. Examination includes x rays to checkfor bone fractures or foreign objects in the wound.\nDoctors do not usually suture a bite wound because\nthe connective tissues and other structures in the handform many small closed spaces that make it easy forinfection to spread. Emergency room doctors often con-sult surgical specialists if a patient has a deep closed-fistinjury or one that appears already infected.\nThe doctor will make sure that the patient is immu-\nnized against tetanus , which is routine procedure for any\nopen wound. Because of risk of infection, all patientswith human bite wounds should be given antibiotics .\nPatients with closed-fist injuries may need inpatienttreatment in addition to an intravenous antibiotic.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the location of the bite\nand whether it was caused by a child or an adult. Bitescaused by children rarely become infected because theyare usually shallow. Between 15–30% of bites caused byadults become infected, with a higher rate for closed-fistinjuries.KEY TERMS\nClosed-fist injury —A hand wound caused when\nthe skin of the fist is torn open by contact withteeth.\nDebridement —The surgical removal of dead tis-\nsue and/or foreign bodies from a wound or cut.\n“Fight bite” —Another name for closed-fist injury.\nNecrotizing —Causing the death of a specific area\nof tissue. Human bites frequently cause necrotiz-ing infections.Prevention\nPrevention of human bite infections depends upon\nprompt treatment of any bite caused by a human being,particularly a closed-fist injury.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBattan, F.

This organ will helpnourish the developing new life. The placenta produceshCG, whose presence, along with other hormones, helpsmaintain the early stages of pregnancy. Because hCG isproduced only by placental tissue and the hormone can befound in the blood or urine of a pregnant woman, it hasbecome a convenient chemical test of pregnancy.\nAfter implantation, the level of detectable hCG rises\nvery rapidly, approximately doubling in quantity every\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1678Human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy testtwo days until a peak is reached between the sixth and\neighth week. Over the next ten or more weeks, the quan-tity of hCG slowly decreases. After this point, a muchlower level is sustained for the duration of the pregnancy.Detectable levels of this hormone may even persist for amonth or two after delivery.\nBlood tests for hCG are the most sensitive and can\ndetect a pregnancy earlier than urine tests. Blood tests forhCG can also distinguish normal pregnancies fromimpending miscarriages or pregnancies that occur out-side of the uterus (ectopic pregnancies).\nIf a woman misses her menstrual period and wants\nto know if she may be pregnant, she can purchase one ofmany home pregnancy test kits that are currently avail-able. Although each of these products may look slightlydifferent and provide a different set of directions for use,each one detects the presence of hCG. This indicatorcontains chemical components called antibodies that aresensitive to a certain quantity of this hormone.KEY TERMS\nEctopic pregnancy —A pregnancy that develops\noutside of the mother’s uterus. Ectopic pregnanciesoften cause severe pain in the lower abdomen andare potentially life-threatening because of the mas-sive blood loss that may occur as the developingembryo/fetus ruptures and damages the tissues inwhich it has implanted.\nEmbyro —In humans, the developing individual\nfrom the time of implantation to about the end ofthe second month after conception. From the thirdmonth to the point of delivery, the individual iscalled a fetus.\nHormone —A chemical produced by a specific\norgan or tissue of the body that is released into thebloodstream in order to exert an effect in anotherpart of the body.\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) —A hor-\nmone produced by the placenta of a developingpregnancy.\nHydatidform mole —A rare, generally benign grape-\nlike mass that grows in the uterus from the remainsof an abnormally developed embryo and surround-ing tissue. In extremely rare cases, the mole devel-ops into a choriocarcinoma, a malignant tumorwhose cells can invade the wall of the uterus.Implantation —The attachment of the fertilized egg\nor embryo to the wall of the uterus.\nMenstrual cycle —A hormonally regulated series of\nmonthly events that occur during the reproductiveyears of the human female to ensure that the properinternal environment exists for fertilization, implan-tation, and development of a baby. Each month, amature egg is released from the follicle of an ovary.If an egg is released, fertilized, and implanted, thelining of the uterus continues to build. If fertilizationand/or implantation does not occur, the egg and allof the excess uterine lining are shed from the bodyduring menstruation.\nMiscarriage —Loss of the embryo or fetus and other\nproducts of pregnancy before the middle of the sec-ond trimester. Often, early in a pregnancy, if thecondition of the baby and/or the mother’s uterus arenot compatible with sustaining life, the pregnancystops, and the contents of the uterus are expelled.For this reason, miscarriage is also referred to asspontaneous abortion.\nPlacenta —The organ that unites the developing\nnew life (first called an embryo and later a fetus) tothe mother’s uterus. The placenta produces hCG,among other hormones, to help maintain the preg-nancy. After delivery, the placenta, known at thispoint as afterbirth, is expelled.\nPrecautions\nAlthough home pregnancy tests may be advertised as\nhaving an accuracy of 97% or better, studies indicate that,in practice, pregnancy tests performed in the home mayincorrectly indicate that a woman is not pregnant (a falsepositive result) between 25–50% of the time. Studies alsoindicate that the false negative results usually result fromfailing to follow the package directions or testing too soonafter a missed menstrual period. Waiting a few days afterthe missed period was expected can increase the accuracyof the test. Blood and urine tests performed by a laboratoryare from 97–100% accurate in detecting pregnancy.\nPreparation\nGenerally, no preparation is required for a pregnancy\ntest given in a doctor’s office.\nHome pregnancy test kits can be divided into two\nbasic types. One type involves the use of a wand-like\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1679Human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy testdevice that a woman must place into her urine stream for\na brief period of time. The other type of kit involves theuse of a cup, a dropper, and a wand or stick with a smallwell. The cup is used to collect the urine, and the dropperis used to transfer a specific number of drops into thewell. Results are displayed by a color change. It’s impor-tant to follow the package directions very carefully (thetechniques vary from brand to brand) and to read theresults in the time specified.\nAftercare\nNo special care is required after a urine test for\nhCG. Women who feel faint or who continue to bleedafter a blood test should be observed until the conditiongoes away.\nRisks\nTests for hCG levels pose no direct risk to a\nwoman’s health. The main risk with a home pregnancytest is a false negative result, which may be lessened byfollowing the manufacturer’s instructions carefully andwaiting at least several days after the expected menstrualperiod to test. A false negative result can cause a delay inseeking prenatal care, which can pose a risk to both thewoman and the baby.\nAbnormal results\nIn most cases, a positive result is an indication of preg-\nnancy. However, false positive results may also occur. If apregnancy test is performed within a month or two of arecent birth or miscarriage , it is possible to test positive for\npregnancy since hCG may still be detected in a woman’surine. Sometimes positive pregnancy tests provide clues ofan early miscarriage that might have otherwise gone unrec-ognized because it occurred before or just after a missedperiod. An ectopic pregnancy (one in which an embryo\nimplants outside the uterus), certain types of masses (suchas an ovarian tumor or a hydatidiform mole ), and the use\nof some fertility drugs that contain hCG are among otherpossibilities behind false positive results.\nNormal results\nA woman should notify her physician immediately if\nher home pregnancy test is positive. Pregnancy can then beconfirmed with hCG urine or blood tests taken in the doc-tor’s office and evaluated by laboratory personnel. If per-formed accurately, home pregnancy tests have been foundto be highly reliable. However, the versions of these testsperformed by qualified laboratory technologists are con-sidered to be definitive. Often, such a test will producepositive results before a woman experiences symptoms orbefore a doctor’s exam reveals signs of pregnancy.Resources\nBOOKS\nCunningham, F. Gary, ed.

    "content": "Human leukocyte antigen test\nDefinition\nThe human leukocyte antigen test, also known as\nHLA, is a test that detects antigens (genetic markers) onwhite blood cells. There are four types of human leuko-cyte antigens: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-D.\nPurpose\nThe HLA test is used to provide evidence of tissue\ncompatibility typing of tissue recipients and donors. It isalso an aid in genetic counseling and in paternity testing.\nPrecautions\nThis test may have to be postponed if the patient has\nrecently undergone a transfusion .\nDescription\nHuman leukocyte antigen (leukocyte is the name for\nwhite blood cell, while antigen refers to a genetic mark-er) is a substance that is located on the surface of whiteblood cells. This substance plays an important role in thebody’s immune response.\nBecause the HLA antigens are essential to immuni-\nty, identification aids in determination of the degree oftissue compatibility between transplant recipients and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1680Human leukocyte antigen testdonors. Testing is done to diminish the likelihood of\nrejection after transplant, and to avoid graft-versus-hostdisease (GVHD) following major organ or bone marrow\ntransplantation . It should be noted that risk of GVHD\nexists even when the donor and recipient share majorantigens. As an example, it was recently discovered that amismatch of HA-1 (a minor antigen) was a cause ofGVHD in bone marrow grafts from otherwise HLA-identical donors.\nHLA can aid in paternity exclusion testing, a highly\nspecialized area of forensic medicine. To resolve cases ofdisputed paternity, a man who demonstrates a phenotype(two haplotypes: one from the father and one from themother) with no haplotype or antigen pair identical toone of the child’s is excluded as the father. Conversely, aman who has one haplotype identical to one of the child’smay be the father (the probability varies with the appear-ance of that particular haplotype in the population).Because of the issues involved, this type of testing isreferred to experts.\nCertain HLA types have been linked to diseases,\nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis ,multiple sclerosis , serum\nlupus erythematosus, and other autoimmune disorders .\nBy themselves, however, none of the HLA types are con-sidered definitive. Because the clinical significance ofmany of the marker antigens has not yet been welldefined, definitive diagnosis of disease is obtained by theuse of more specific tests.\nPreparation\nThe HLA test requires a blood sample. There is no\nneed for the patient to be fasting (having nothing to eat\nor drink) before the test.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\nNormal results\nIdentification of specific leukocyte antigens, HLA-\nA, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-D.\nAbnormal results\nIncompatible groups between organ donors and\nrecipients may cause unsuccessful tissue transplantation.\nCertain diseases have a strong association with cer-\ntain types of HLAs, which may aid in genetic counseling.For example, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (an autoimmuneKEY TERMS\nAutoimmune disorders —A disorder caused by a\nreaction of an individual’s immune system againstthe organs or tissues of the body.

HLA-A3 is found in approximately 70% of patients withhemochromatosis, but as is the case with other HLA-associated disorders, the expense of HLA typing favorsuse of other tests. In cases of suspected hemochromato-sis, for example, diagnosis is better aided by two testscalled transferrin saturation and serum ferritin.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

The disease was discovered byGeorge Huntington of Pomeroy, Ohio, who firstdescribed a hereditary movement disorder.\nDescription\nHuntington disease is also called Huntington chorea,\nfrom the Greek word for “dance,” referring to the invol-untary movements that develop as the disease progresses.It is occasionally referred to as “Woody Guthrie disease”for the American folk singer who died from it. Hunting-ton disease (HD) causes progressive loss of cells in areasof the brain responsible for some aspects of movementcontrol and mental abilities. A person with HD graduallydevelops abnormal movements and changes in cognition(thinking), behavior and personality.\nThe onset of symptoms of HD is usually between\nthe ages of 30 and 50; although in 10% of cases, onsetis in late childhood or early adolescence. Approximate-ly 30,000 people in the United States are affected byHD, with another 150,000 at risk for developing thisdisorder. The frequency of HD is four to seven per100,000 persons.\nCauses and symptoms\nHuntington disease is caused by a defect in the gene\n(an inherited unit which contains a code for a protein) ofunknown function called huntingtin. The nucleotide codes(building blocks of genes arranged in a specific codewhich chemically forms into proteins), contain CAGrepeats (40 or more of these repeat sequences). The extrabuilding blocks in the huntingtin gene cause the proteinthat is made from it to contain an extra section as well. It iscurrently thought that this extra protein section, or portion,interacts with other proteins in brain cells where it occurs,and that this interaction ultimately leads to cell death .\nThe HD gene is a dominant gene, meaning that only\none copy of it is needed to develop the disease. HDaffects both males and females. The gene may be inherit-ed from either parent, who will also be affected by thedisease. A parent with the HD gene has a 50% chance ofpassing it on to each offspring. The chances of passingon the HD gene are not affected by the results of previ-ous pregnancies.\nThe symptoms of HD fall into three categories:\nmotor or movement symptoms, personality and behav-ioral changes and cognitive decline. The severity and rateof progression of each type of symptom can vary fromperson to person.\nEarly motor symptoms include restlessness, twitch-\ning and a desire to move about. Handwriting may becomeless controlled, and coordination may decline. Latersymptoms include:\n• dystonia, or sustained abnormal postures, including\nfacial grimaces, a twisted neck, or an arched back\n• chorea, in which involuntary jerking, twisting or\nwrithing motions become pronounced\n• slowness of voluntary movements, inability to regulate\nthe speed or force of movements, inability to initiatemovement and slowed reactions\n• difficulty speaking and swallowing due to involvement\nof the throat muscles\n• localized or generalized weakness and impaired bal-\nance ability\n• rigidity, especially in late-stage disease\nPersonality and behavioral changes include depres-\nsion, irritability, anxiety and apathy. The person with\nHD may become impulsive, aggressive or socially with-drawn.\nCognitive changes include loss of ability to plan\nand execute routine tasks, slowed thought, and impairedor inappropriate judgment. Short-term memory lossusually occurs, although long-term memory is usuallynot affected. The person with late-stage HD usuallyretains knowledge of his environment and recognizesfamily members or other loved ones, despite severecognitive decline.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of HD begins with a detailed medical his-\ntory, and a thorough physical and neurological exam.Family medical history is very important. Magnetic res-\nonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scan\n(CT scan) imaging may be performed to look for degen-eration in the basal ganglia and cortex, the brain regionsmost affected in HD.\nA genetic test is available for confirmation of the\nclinical diagnosis. In this test, a small blood sample istaken, and DNA from it is analyzed to determine theCAG repeat number. A person with a repeat number of30 or below will not develop HD. A person with a repeatnumber between 35 and 40 may not develop the diseasewithin their normal lifespan. A person with a very highnumber of repeats (70 or above) is likely to develop thejuvenile-onset form. An important part of genetic testing\nis extensive genetic counseling .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1682Huntington diseasePrenatal testing is available. A person at risk for HD\n(a child of an affected person) may obtain fetal testingwithout determining whether she herself carries the gene.This test, also called a linkage test, examines the patternof DNA near the gene in both parent and fetus, but doesnot analyze for the triple nucleotide repeat (CAG). If theDNA patterns do not match, the fetus can be assumed notto have inherited the HD gene, even if present in the par-ent. A pattern match indicates the fetus probably has thesame genetic makeup of the at-risk parent.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for HD, nor any treatment that can\nslow the rate of progression. Treatment is aimed at reduc-ing the disability caused by the motor impairments, andtreating behavioral and emotional symptoms.\nPhysical therapy is used to maintain strength and\ncompensate for lost strength and balance. Stretching andrange of motion exercises help minimize contracture, ormuscle shortening, a result of weakness and disuse. Thephysical therapist also advises on the use of mobility aidssuch as walkers or wheelchairs.\nMotor symptoms may be treated with drugs,\nalthough some studies suggest that anti-chorea treat-ment rarely improves function. Chorea (movementscaused by abnormal muscle contractions) can be sup-pressed with drugs that deplete dopamine, an importantbrain chemical regulating movement. As HD progress-es, natural dopamine levels fall, leading to loss ofchorea and an increase in rigidity and movement slow-ness. Treatment with L-dopa (which resuppliesdopamine) may be of some value. Frequent reassess-ment of the effectiveness and appropriateness of anydrug therapy is necessary.\nOccupational therapy is used to design compensato-\nry strategies for lost abilities in the activities of daily liv-ing, such as eating, dressing, and grooming. The occupa-tional therapist advises on modifications to the home thatimprove safety, accessibility, and comfort.\nDifficulty swallowing may be lessened by prepara-\ntion of softer foods, blending food in an electric blender,and taking care to eat slowly and carefully. Use of astraw for all liquids can help. The potential for choking\non food is a concern, especially late in the disease pro-gression. Caregivers should learn the use of the Heim-\nlich maneuver . In addition, passage of food into the air-\nways increases the risk for pneumonia .

Loss of cognitive ability affects both speech\nproduction and understanding. A speech-languagepathologist can work with the family to develop simpli-fied and more directed communication strategies, includ-ing speaking slowly, using simple words, and repeatingsentences exactly.\nEarly behavioral changes, including depression and\nanxiety, may respond to drug therapy. Maintaining acalm, familiar, and secure environment is useful as thedisease progresses. Support groups for both patients andcaregivers form an important part of treatment.\nExperimental transplant of fetal brain tissue has\nbeen attempted in a few HD patients. Early results showsome promise, but further trials are needed to establishthe effectiveness of this treatment.\nPrognosis\nThe person with Huntington disease may be able to\nmaintain a job for several years after diagnosis, despitethe increase in disability.

    "title": "Hydatidiform mole",
    "content": "Hydatidiform mole\nDefinition\nA hydatidiform mole is a relatively rare condition in\nwhich tissue around a fertilized egg that normally wouldhave developed into the placenta instead develops as anabnormal cluster of cells. (This is also called a molarpregnancy.) This grapelike mass forms inside of theuterus after fertilization instead of a normal embryo. Ahydatidiform mole triggers a positive pregnancy test and\nin some cases can become cancerous.\nDescription\nA hydatidiform mole (“hydatid” means “drop of\nwater” and “mole” means “spot”) occurs in about 1 outof every 1,500 (1/1,500) pregnancies in the UnitedStates. In some parts of Asia, however, the incidence maybe as high as 1 in 200 (1/200). Molar pregnancies aremost likely to occur in younger and older women (espe-cially over age 45) than in those between ages 20–40.About 1–2% of the time a woman who has had a molarpregnancy will have a second one.\nA molar pregnancy occurs when cells of the chori-\nonic villi (tiny projections that attach the placenta to thelining of the uterus) don’t develop correctly. Instead, theyturn into watery clusters that can’t support a growingbaby. A partial molar pregnancy includes an abnormalembryo (a fertilized egg that has begun to grow) thatdoes not survive. In a compete molar pregnancy there is asmall cluster of clear blisters or pouches that don’t con-tain an embryo.\nIf not removed, about 15% of moles can become\ncancerous. They burrow into the wall of the uterus andcause serious bleeding. Another 5% will develop intofast-growing cancers called choriocarcinomas. Some ofthese tumors spread very quickly outside the uterus inother parts of the body. Fortunately, cancer developing\nfrom these moles is rare and highly curable.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of hydatidiform mole is unclear; some\nexperts believe it is caused by problems with the chromo-somes (the structures inside cells that contain geneticinformation) in either the egg or sperm, or both. It maybe associated with poor nutrition , or a problem with the\novaries or the uterus. A mole sometimes can developfrom placental tissue that is left behind in the uterus aftera miscarriage or childbirth .\nWomen with a hydatidiform mole will have a posi-\ntive pregnancy test and often believe they have a normalpregnancy for the first three or four months. However, inthese cases the uterus will grow abnormally fast. By theend of the third month, if not earlier, the woman willexperience vaginal bleeding ranging from scant spottingto excessive bleeding. She may have hyperthyroidism\n(overproduction of thyroid hormones causing symp-\ntoms such as weight loss, increased appetite, and intol-erance to heat). Sometimes, the grapelike cluster ofcells itself will be shed with the blood during this time.Other symptoms may include severe nausea and vom-\niting and high blood pressure. As the pregnancy pro-\ngresses, the fetus will not move and there will be nofetal heartbeat.\nDiagnosis\nThe physician may not suspect a molar pregnancy\nuntil after the third month or later, when the absence of afetal heartbeat together with bleeding and severe nauseaand vomiting indicates something is amiss.\nFirst, the physician will examine the woman’s\nabdomen, feeling for any strange lumps or abnormali-ties in the uterus. A tubal pregnancy, which can be lifethreatening if not treated, will be ruled out. Then thephysician will check the levels of human chorionicgonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that is normally pro-duced by a placenta or a mole. Abnormally high levels\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1684Hydatidiform moleof hCG together with the symptoms of vaginal bleed-\ning, lack of fetal heartbeat, and an unusually largeuterus all indicate a molar pregnancy. An ultrasound ofthe uterus to make sure there is no living fetus will con-firm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nIt is extremely important to make sure that all of the\nmole is removed from the uterus, since it is possible thatthe tissue is potentially cancerous. Often, the tissue isnaturally expelled by the fourth month of pregnancy. Insome instances, the physician will give the woman a drugcalled oxytocin to trigger the release of the mole that isnot spontaneously aborted.\nIf this does not happen, however, a vacuum aspira-\ntion can be performed to remove the mole. In a proceduresimilar to a dilatation and curettage (D & C), a woman\nis given an anesthetic (to deaden feeling during the pro-cedure), her cervix (the structure at the bottom of theuterus) is dilated and the contents of the uterus is gentlysuctioned out. After the mole has been mostly removed,gentle scraping of the uterus lining is usually performed.\nIf the woman is older and does not want any more\nchildren, the uterus can be surgically removed ( hysterec-\ntomy ) instead of a vacuum aspiration because of the\nhigher risk of cancerous moles in this age group.\nBecause of the cancer risk, the physician will con-\ntinue to monitor the patient for at least two months afterthe end of a molar pregnancy. Since invasive disease isusually signaled by high levels of hCG that don’t godown after the pregnancy has ended, the woman’s hCGlevels will be checked every two weeks. If the levelsdon’t return to normal by that time, the mole may havebecome cancerous.\nIf the hCG level is normal, the woman’s hCG will be\ntested each month for six months, and then every twomonths for a year.\nIf the mole has become cancerous, treatment\nincludes removal of the cancerous issue and chemother-\napy. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body,\nradiation will be added. Specific treatment depends onhow advanced the cancer is.\nWomen should make sure not to become pregnant\nwithin a year after hCG levels have returned to normal. Ifa woman were to become pregnant sooner than that, itwould be difficult to tell whether the resulting high levelsof hCG were caused by the pregnancy or a cancer fromthe mole.KEY TERMS\nDilatation and curettage (D & C) —Dilating the\ncervix and scraping the lining of the uterus with aninstrument called a curette.\nPlacenta —The circular, flat organ that connects\nthe fetus via the umbilical cord to the uterus foroxygen, food, and elimination of wastes.\nPrognosis\nA woman with a molar pregnancy often goes\nthrough the same emotions and sense of loss as does awoman who has a miscarriage. Most of the time, shetruly believed she was pregnant and now has suffered aloss of the baby she thought she was carrying. In addi-tion, there is the added worry that the tissue left behindcould become cancerous.\nIn the unlikely case that the mole is cancerous the\ncure rate is almost 100%. As long as the uterus was notremoved, it would still be possible to have a child at alater time.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie A.

    "title": "Hydrocelectomy",
    "content": "Hydrocelectomy\nDefinition\nHydrocelectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a\nhydrocele. A hydrocele is collected fluid in the mem-brane surrounding the testes.\nPurpose\nHydrocelectomy is performed to relieve the pain or\nreoccurrence of a hydrocele. Normally, hydroceles arenot very painful. They tend to be a soft swelling in themembrane surrounding the testes. As the hydrocele\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1685Hydatidiform molegrows, the scrotum gets larger. Hydroceles do not dam-\nage the testes. The main symptom is scrotal swelling.There are two types of hydroceles depending on howthey form. One type is seen in children, generally shortlyafter birth. It is caused by a failure of the processus vagi-nalis to close. Usually, surgery isn’t used to treat hydro-cele until after two years of age because the processusvaginalis frequently closes by itself if given extra time. Inadults, hydroceles develop slowly. Most hydrocelesdevelop because of blocked lymphatic flow. Hydrocelesalso develop after infection, injury, or local cancer\ntumors. Generally, hydroceles are treated by aspiration ofthe collected fluid. To do this, a needle is inserted intothe scrotum and directed toward the hydrocele. Oncethere, as much fluid as possible is removed. Hydrocelescan reoccur. Rarely, hydroceles grow larger and causepain. Surgery is used to remove large or painful hydroce-les. It is also the recommended procedure to removehydroceles that reoccur after aspiration. Hydroceles aredistinguished from other testicular problems by transillu-mination and scrotal ultrasound examinations.\nPrecautions\nNo special precautions are required for hydrocelec-\ntomy. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis.\nDescription\nAspiration of the fluid in a hydrocele is usually suc-\ncessful. However, aspiration may be only a temporarysolution because of the potential that the hydrocele willreoccur. Generally, surgical repair of a hydrocele willeliminate the hydrocele. The extent of the surgerydepends on whether other factors are present. If thehydrocele is uncomplicated, an incision is made in thescrotum. The hydrocele is cut out, removing the tissuesinvolved in the hydrocele. If there are complications pre-sent, such as a hernia , an incision is made in the inguinal\n(groin) area. This approach allows repair of hernias andother complicating factors at the same time. Patients areplaced under general anesthesia for these operations.\nPreparation\nA physician or nurse will explain the procedure and,\nin some cases, the need for a temporary drain to beinserted. The drain lessens the chance of infection andprevents fluid build-up.\nAftercare\nFollowing surgery, the patient usually only needs a\nfollow-up examination several weeks after the surgery toexamine the incision and to check for signs of infection.KEY TERMS\nAspiration —The process of removing fluids or\ngases from the body by suction.\nHernia —The protrusion of an organ or tissue\nthrough a wall that normally contains it.\nHydrocele —An accumulation of fluid in the mem-\nbrane surrounding the testes (tunica vaginalis testis).\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk of infection and internal hemor-\nrhage as well as a chance of excessive bleeding from thesurgical incision.\nNormal results\nThere may be swelling of the scrotum for up to a\nmonth. The patient is able to resume most activities with-in 7–10 days, although heavy lifting and sexual activitiesmay be delayed for up to six weeks.

Acquired hydrocephalusmay result from spina bifida , intraventricular hemor-\nrhage, meningitis , head trauma, tumors, and cysts.\nDescription\nHydrocephalus is the result of an imbalance between\nthe formation and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Approximately 500 milliliters (about a pint) of CSF isformed within the brain each day, by epidermal cells instructures collectively called the choroid plexus. Thesecells line chambers called ventricles that are locatedwithin the brain. There are four ventricles in a humanbrain. Once formed, CSF usually circulates among all theventricles before it is absorbed and returned to the circu-latory system. The normal adult volume of circulatingCSF is 150 ml. The CSF turn-over rate is more than threetimes per day. Because production is independent ofabsorption, reduced absorption causes CSF to accumu-late within the ventricles.\nThere are three different types of hydrocephalus.\nIn the most common variety, reduced absorption occurswhen one or more passages connecting the ventriclesbecome blocked. This prevents the movement of CSFto its drainage sites in the subarachnoid space justinside the skull. This type of hydrocephalus is called“noncommunicating.” In a second type, a reduction inthe absorption rate is caused by damage to the absorp-tive tissue. This variety is called “communicatinghydrocephalus.”\nBoth of these types lead to an elevation of the CSF\npressure within the brain. This increased pressure pushesaside the soft tissues of the brain. This squeezes and dis-torts them. This process also results in damage to thesetissues. In infants whose skull bones have not yet fused,the intracranial pressure is partly relieved by expansionof the skull, so that symptoms may not be as dramatic.Both types of elevated-pressure hydrocephalus mayoccur from infancy to adulthood.\nA third type of hydrocephalus, called “normal pres-\nsure hydrocephalus,” is marked by ventricle enlargementwithout an apparent increase in CSF pressure. This typeaffects mainly the elderly.\nHydrocephalus has a variety of causes including:\n• congenital brain defects\n• hemorrhage, either into the ventricles or the subarach-\nnoid space\n• infection of the central nervous system ( syphilis , her-\npes, meningitis, encephalitis , or mumps)\n• tumorHydrocephalus is believed to occur in approximately\none to two of every 1,000 live births. The incidence ofadult onset hydrocephalus is not known. There is noknown way to prevent hydrocephalus.\nCauses and symptoms\nHydrocephalus that is congenital (present at birth)\nis thought to be caused by a complex interaction ofgenetic and environmental factors. Aqueductal steno-sis, an obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, is the mostfrequent cause of congenital hydrocephalus. As of2001, the genetic factors are not well understood.According to the British Association for Spina Bifidaand Hydrocephalus, in very rare circumstances, hydro-cephalus is due to hereditary factors, which mightaffect future generations.\nSigns and symptoms of elevated-pressure hydro-\ncephalus include:\n• headache\n• nausea and vomiting, especially in the morning• lethargy\n• disturbances in walking (gait)\n• double vision• subtle difficulties in learning and memory\n• delay in children achieving developmental milestones\nIrritability is the most common sign of hydro-\ncephalus in infants. If this is not treated, it may lead tolethargy. Bulging of the fontanelles, or the soft spotsbetween the skull bones, may also be an early sign.When hydrocephalus occurs in infants, fusion of theskull bones is prevented. This leads to abnormal expan-sion of the skull.\nSymptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus include\ndementia , gait abnormalities, and incontinence (involun-\ntary urination or bowel movements).\nDiagnosis\nImaging studies—x ray, computed tomography scan\n(CT scan), ultrasound, and especially magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI)—are used to assess the presence\nand location of obstructions, as well as changes in braintissue that have occurred as a result of the hydrocephalus.Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to aid indetermining the cause when infection is suspected.\nTreatment\nThe primary method of treatment for both elevat-\ned and normal pressure hydrocephalus is surgical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1687Hydrocephalusinstallation of a shunt. A shunt is a tube connecting the\nventricles of the brain to an alternative drainage site,usually the abdominal cavity. A shunt contains a one-way valve to prevent reverse flow of fluid. In somecases of non-communicating hydrocephalus, a directconnection can be made between one of the ventriclesand the subarachnoid space, allowing drainage with-out a shunt.\nInstallation of a shunt requires lifelong monitoring\nby the recipient or family members for signs of recurringhydrocephalus due to obstruction or failure of the shunt.Other than monitoring, no other management activity isusually required.\nSome drugs may postpone the need for surgery by\ninhibiting the production of CSF. These include acetazo-lamide and furosemide. Other drugs that are used todelay surgery include glycerol, digoxin, and isosorbide.\nSome cases of elevated pressure hydrocephalus may\nbe avoided by preventing or treating the infectious dis-eases which precede them. Prenatal diagnosis of congen-ital brain malformation is often possible, offering theoption of family planning.KEY TERMS\nCerebral ventricles —Spaces in the brain that are\nlocated between portions of the brain and filledwith cerebrospinal fluid.\nCerebrospinal fluid —Fluid that circulates\nthroughout the cerebral ventricles and around thespinal cord within the spinal canal.\nChoroid plexus —Specialized cells located in the\nventricles of the brain that produce cerebrospinalfluid.\nFontanelle —One of several “soft spots” on the\nskull where the developing bones of the skull haveyet to fuse.\nShunt —A small tube placed in a ventricle of the\nbrain to direct cerebrospinal fluid away from theblockage into another part of the body.\nStenosis —The constricting or narrowing of an\nopening or passageway.\nSubarachnoid space —The space between two\nmembranes surrounding the brain, the arachnoidand pia mater.Prognosis\nThe prognosis for elevated-pressure hydrocephalus\ndepends on a wide variety of factors, including the cause,age of onset, and the timing of surgery. Studies indicatethat about half of all children who receive appropriatetreatment and follow-up will develop IQs greater than85. Those with hydrocephalus at birth do better thanthose with later onset due to meningitis. For individualswith normal pressure hydrocephalus, approximately halfwill benefit by the installation of a shunt.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDrake, James M., and Christian Sainte-Rose.

    "title": "Hydronephrosis",
    "content": "Hydronephrosis\nDefinition\nHydronephrosis is the swelling of the kidneys when\nurine flow is obstructed in any of part of the urinary tract.Swelling of the ureter, which always accompanieshydronephrosis, is called hydroureter. Hydronephrosisimplies that a ureter and the renal pelvis (the connectionof the ureter to the kidney) are overfilled with urine.\nDescription\nThe kidneys filter urine out of the blood as a waste\nproduct. It collects in the renal pelvis and flows downthe ureters into the bladder. The ureters are not simpletubes, but muscular passages that actively propel urineinto the bladder. At their lower end is a valve (theureterovesical junction) that prevents urine from flowingbackward into the ureter. The bladder stores urine. Theprostate gland surrounds the bladder outlet in males.Urine then flows through the urethra and out of the bodyas a waste product.\nBecause the urinary tract is closed save for the one\nopening at the bottom, urine cannot escape. Instead, theparts distend. Rupture is rare unless there is violent trau-ma like an automobile accident.\nObstructed flow anywhere along the drainage route\ncan cause swelling of the upper urinary tract, but if theobstruction is below the bladder, the ureterovesical valvewill protect the upper tract to a certain extent. Even then,with no place to go, the urine will back up all the way toits source. Eventually, the back pressure causes kidneyfunction to deteriorate.\nObstruction need not be complete for problems to\narise. Intermittent or partial obstruction is far more com-mon than complete blockage, allowing time for the partsto enlarge gradually. Furthermore, if a ureterovesicalvalve is absent or incompetent, the pressure generated bybladder emptying will force urine backward into theureter and kidney, causing dilation even without mechan-ical obstruction.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses are numerous. Various congenital deformi-\nties of the ureter may sooner or later produce back pres-sure. Kidney stones are a common cause. They form in\nthe renal pelvis and become lodged in the kidney, usuallyat the ureterovesical junction. In older men, the contin-ued growth of the prostate gland leads commonly torestricted urine flow out of the bladder. Prostate cancer ,\nand cancer anywhere else along the urine pathways, can\nobstruct flow. Pregnancy normally causes ureteral\nobstruction from the pressure of the enlarged uterus(womb) on the ureters.\nSymptoms relate to the passage of urine. Some-\ntimes, urine may be difficult to pass, irregular, or uncon-trolled. Pain from distension of the structures is present.\nBlood in the urine may be visible, but it is usually micro-scopic.\nIn all cases where bodily fluids cannot flow freely,\ninfection is inevitable. Symptoms of urinary infectionmay include:\n• Painful, burning urine.• Cloudy urine• Pain in the back, flank, or groin• Fever, sweats, chills, and generalized discomfort\nPatients often mistake a serious urinary infection for\nthe flu.\nDiagnosis\nIf the bladder is significantly distended, it can be felt\nthrough the abdomen. An analysis of the urine mayreveal blood (if there is a stone), infection, or chemicalchanges suggesting kidney damage. Blood tests may alsodetect a decrease in kidney function.\nAll urinary obstructions will undergo imaging of\nsome sort. Beginning with standard x rays to look forstones, radiologists, physicians specializing in the use ofradiant energy for diagnostic purposes, will select from awide array of tests. Ultrasound is simple, inexpensive,and very useful for these conditions. Standard x rays canbe enhanced with contrast agents in several ways. If thekidneys are functioning, they will filter an x ray dye outof the blood and concentrate it in the urine, giving excel-lent pictures and also an assessment of kidney function.For better images of the lower urinary tract, contrastagents can be instilled from below. This is usually donewith a cystoscope placed in the bladder. Through the cys-toscope, a small tube can be threaded into the ureterthrough the ureterovesical valve, allowing dye to beinjected all the way up to the kidney. CT and MRI scan-ning provide miraculous detail, more than is often need-ed for this condition.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1689HydronephrosisTreatment\nThe obstruction must be relieved, even if it is partial\nor functional, as in the case of reflux from the bladder. Ifnot, the kidney will ultimately be damaged, infection willappear, or both. The task may be as simple as placing acatheter through a restricting prostate or as complicatedas removing a cancerous bladder and rebuilding a newone with a piece of bowel. In some cases, a badly dam-aged kidney may have to be removed.\nAlternative treatment\nCatheters or other urinary diversions may be better\nfor weak or ill patients who cannot tolerate more exten-sive procedures. There is support using botanical medi-cine that can help the patient using a catheter avoid infec-tions. Consultation with a trained health care practitioneris necessary.\nPrognosis\nAfter relief of the obstruction, a kidney may react\nwith a brief flood of urine, but if the obstruction has beenof short duration, normal kidney function will return. Ifone kidney is destroyed, the other will compensate forthe lost organ.\nPrevention\nKidney stones can be prevented by dietary changes\nand medication.

    "content": "Hydrotherapy\nDefinition\nHydrotherapy, or water therapy, is the use of water\n(hot, cold, steam, or ice) to relieve discomfort and pro-mote physical well-being.\nPurpose\nHydrotherapy can soothe sore or inflamed muscles\nand joints, rehabilitate injured limbs, lower fevers, sootheheadaches, promote relaxation, treat burns and frostbite,\nease labor pains, and clear up skin problems. The temper-ature of water used affects the therapeutic properties ofthe treatment. Hot water is chosen for its relaxing proper-ties. It is also thought to stimulate the immune system.Tepid water can also be used for stress reduction , and\nmay be particularly relaxing in hot weather. Cold water isselected to reduce inflammation. Alternating hot and coldwater can stimulate the circulatory system and improve\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1690Hydrotherapythe immune system. Adding herbs and essential oils to\nwater can enhance its therapeutic value. Steam is fre-quently used as a carrier for essential oils that are inhaledto treat respiratory problems.\nDescription\nOrigins\nThe therapeutic use of water has a long history.\nRuins of an ancient bath were unearthed in Pakistan anddate as far back as 4500 \nB.C. Bathhouses were an essen-\ntial part of ancient Roman culture. The use of steam,baths, and aromatic massage to promote well being isdocumented since the first century. Roman physiciansGalen and Celsus wrote of treating patients with warmand cold baths in order to prevent disease.\nBy the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, bath-\nhouses were extremely popular with the public through-out Europe. Public bathhouses made their first Americanappearance in the mid 1700s.\nIn the early nineteenth century, Sebastien Kneipp, a\nBavarian priest and proponent of water healing, begantreating his parishioners with cold water applicationsafter he himself was cured of tuberculosis through the\nsame methods. Kneipp wrote extensively on the subject,and opened a series of hydrotherapy clinics known as theKneipp clinics, which are still in operation today. Aroundthe same time in Austria, Vincenz Priessnitz was treatingpatients with baths, packs, and showers of cold springwater. Priessnitz also opened a spa that treated over1,500 patients in its first year of operation, and became amodel for physicians and other specialists to learn thetechniques of hydrotherapy.\nWater can be used therapeutically in a number of\nways. Common forms of hydrotherapy include:\n• Whirlpools, jacuzzis, and hot tubs. These soaking\ntubs use jet streams to massage the body. They arefrequently used by physical therapists to help injuredpatients regain muscle strength and to soothe jointand muscle pain . Some midwives and obstetricians\nalso approve of the use of hot tubs to soothe the painof labor.\n• Pools and Hubbard tanks. Physical therapists and reha-\nbilitation specialists may prescribe underwater pool\nexercises as a low-impact method of rebuilding musclestrength in injured patients. The buoyancy experiencedduring pool immersion also helps ease pain in condi-tions such as arthritis.\n• Baths. Tepid baths are prescribed to reduce a fever .\nBaths are also one of the oldest forms of relaxationtherapy. Aromatherapists often recommend addingessential oils of lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia ) to a\nwarm to hot bath to promote relaxation and stress\nreduction. Adding Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) orDead Sea salts to a bath can also promote relaxationand soothe rheumatism and arthritis.\n• Showers. Showers are often prescribed to stimulate the\ncirculation. Water jets from a shower head are also usedto massage sore muscles.\n• Moist compresses. Cold, moist compresses can reduce\nswelling and inflammation of an injury. They can alsobe used to cool a fever and treat a headache . Hot or\nwarm compresses are useful for soothing muscle achesand treating abscesses.\n• Steam treatments and saunas. Steam rooms and saunas\nare recommended to open the skin pores and cleansethe body of toxins. Steam inhalation is prescribed totreat respiratory infections. Adding botanicals to thesteam bath can increase its therapeutic value.\n• Internal hydrotherapy. Colonic irrigation is an\nenema that is designed to cleanse the entire bowel.Proponents of the therapy say it can cure a number ofdigestive problems. Douching, another form of inter-nal hydrotherapy, directs a stream of water into thevagina for cleansing purposes. The water may or maynot contain medications or other substances. Douchescan be self-administered with kits available at mostdrug stores.\nPreparations\nBecause of the expense of the equipment and the\nexpertise required to administer effective treatment,hydrotherapy with pools, whirlpools, Hubbard tanks, andsaunas is best taken in a professional healthcare facility,and/or under the supervision of a healthcare professional.However, baths, steam inhalation treatments, and com-presses can be easily administered at home.\nBath preparations\nWarm to hot bath water should be used for relax-\nation purposes, and a tepid bath is recommended forreducing fevers. Herbs can greatly enhance the therapeu-tic value of the bath for a variety of illnesses and minordiscomforts.\nHerbs for the bath can be added to the bath in two\nways—as essential oils or whole herbs and flowers.Whole herbs and flowers can be placed in a muslin orcheesecloth bag that is tied at the top to make anherbal bath bag. The herbal bath bag is then soaked inthe warm tub, and can remain there throughout thebath. When using essential oils, add five to 10 drops ofoil to a full tub. Oils can be combined to enhance their\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1691Hydrotherapytherapeutic value. Marjoram ( Origanum marjorana ) is\ngood for relieving sore muscles; juniper ( Juniperus\ncommunis ) is recommended as a detoxifying agent for\nthe treatment of arthritis; lavender, ylang ylang(Conanga odorata ), and chamomile ( Chamaemelum\nnobilis ) are recommended for stress relief; cypress\n(Cupressus sempervirens ), yarrow ( Achillea millefoli-\num), geranium ( Pelargonium graveolens ), clary sage\n(Savlia sclaria ), and myrtle ( Myrtus communis ) can\npromote healing of hemorrhoids ; and spike lavender\nand juniper ( Juniperus communis ) are recommended\nfor rheumatism.\nTo prepare salts for the bath, add one or two hand-\nfuls of epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to boiling wateruntil they are dissolved, and then add them to the tub.\nA sitz bath , or hip bath, can also be taken at home to\ntreat hemorrhoids and promote healing of an episiotomy .\nThere is special apparatus available for taking a seatedsitz bath, but it can also be taken in a regular tub partiallyfilled with warm water.VINZENZ PRIESSNITZ (1799–1851)\nSteam inhalation\nSteam inhalation treatments can be easily adminis-\ntered with a bowl of steaming water and a large towel.For colds and other conditions with nasal congestion,aromatherapists recommend adding five drops of anessential oil that has decongestant properties, such aspeppermint ( Mentha piperita ) and eucalyptus blue gum\n(Eucalyptus globulus ). Oils that act as expectorants ,\nsuch as myrtle ( Myrtus communis ) or rosemary ( Rosmar-\ninus officinalis ), can also be used. After the oil is added,\nthe individual should lean over the bowl of water andplace the towel over head to trap the steam. After approx-imately three minutes of inhaling the steam, with eyesclosed, the towel can be removed.\nOther herbs and essential oils that can be beneficial\nin steam inhalation include:\n• tea tree oil ( Melaleuca alternaifolia ) for bronchitis and\nsinus infections\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1692Hydrotherapy\nHydrotherapy inventor Vinzenz Priessnitz was the\nson of a Silesian farmer from a remote Austrian territory inthe Jeseniky Mountains. From the age of 12, Priessnitzdutifully provided for his blind father, his elderly mother,and his sister. His formal education was sporadic at best.\nHowever, Priessnitz possessed a level head and a highdegree of intelligence along with a keen and active mind.As he matured he became extremely aware of his sur-roundings in nature.\nAt age 16, Priessnitz fell from a horse and was seri-\nously hoofed by the animal. He received the morbid prog-nosis that he might be crippled at best, or might die atworst. He set to treating his own chest wound with coldpacks, in emulation of a doe that he had once observedbathing a wound in a cool mountain stream. Thehydrotherapy regimen proved highly effective and drewconsiderable attention to his small hometown of Gräfen-berg. In 1822 he rebuilt the family home, renovating itswooden frame into a solid brick spa structure. The spa,known as the castle, housed as many as 1,500 guests eachyear by 1939. Among the guests were medical profession-als who were intent upon exposing the therapy as a sham.\nDetractors notwithstanding, word of the simple and\neffective treatment spread to Vienna, where Priessnitztraveled on occasion to provide counsel at the emperor’scourt. Priessnitz, for his remarkable discovery, receivedthe Austrian Gold Civil Merit Medal First Class, the high-est civilian honor of the Austrian government.\nPriessnitz died on November 28, 1851. He was sur-\nvived by a wife, Zofie Priessnitz, and a young son, VinzenzPavel. Joseph Schindler took over the operation of the spaat Gräfenberg following the death of its founder.\n(Betmann/CORBIS. Reproduced by permission.)• sandalwood ( Santalum album ), virginian cedarwood\n(Juniperus virginiana ), and frankincense ( Boswellia\ncarteri ) for sore throat\n• lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia ) and thyme ( Thymus\nvulgaris ) for cough\nCompresses\nA cold compress is prepared by soaking a cloth or\ncotton pad in cold water and then applying it to thearea of injury or distress. When the cloth reaches roomtemperature, it should be resoaked and reapplied.Applying gentle pressure to the compress with thehand may be useful. Cold compresses are generallyused to reduce swelling, minimize bruising, and totreat headaches and sprains.\nWarm or hot compresses are used to treat abscesses\nand muscle aches. A warm compress is prepared in thesame manner as a cold compress, except steaming wateris used to wet the cloth instead of cold water. Warm com-presses should be refreshed and reapplied after they coolto room temperature.\nEssential oils may be added to moist compresses\nto increase the therapeutic value of the treatment. Pep-permint, a cooling oil, is especially effective whenadded to cold compresses. To add oils to compresses,place five drops of the oil into the bowl of water thecompress is to be soaked in. Never apply essential oilsdirectly to a cloth, as they may irritate the skin in undi-luted form.\nPrecautions\nIndividuals with paralysis , frostbite, or other condi-\ntions that impair the nerve endings and cause reducedsensation should only take hydrotherapy treatmentsunder the guidance of a trained hydrotherapist, physicaltherapist, or other appropriate healthcare professional.Because these individuals cannot accurately sense tem-perature changes in the water, they run the risk of beingseriously burned without proper supervision. Diabeticsand people with hypertension should also consult their\nhealthcare professional before using hot tubs or otherheat hydrotherapies.\nHot tubs, jacuzzis, and pools can become breeding\ngrounds for bacteria and other infectious organisms ifthey are not cleaned regularly, maintained properly,kept at the appropriate temperatures, and treated withthe proper chemicals. Individuals should check withtheir healthcare provider to ensure that the hydrothera-py equipment they are using is sanitary. Those who areusing hot tubs and other hydrotherapy equipment intheir homes should follow the directions for use andmaintenance provided by the original equipment man-\nufacturer.\nCertain essential oils should not be used by pregnant\nor nursing women or by people with specific illnesses orphysical conditions. Individuals suffering from anychronic or acute health condition should inform theirhealthcare provider before starting treatment with anyessential oil.\nEssential oils such as cinnamon leaf, juniper, lemon,\neucalyptus blue gum, peppermint, and thyme can beextremely irritating to the skin if applied in full concen-tration. Oils used in hydrotherapy should always be dilut-ed in water before they are applied to the skin. Individu-als should never apply essential oils directly to the skinunless directed to do so by a trained healthcare profes-sional and/or aromatherapist.\nColonic irrigation should only be performed by a\nhealthcare professional. Pregnant women should neverdouche, as the practice can introduce bacteria into the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1693Hydrotherapy\nThis patient is treating his injured left leg with a whirlpool\nbath. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)vagina and uterus. They should also avoid using hot tubs\nwithout the consent of their healthcare provider.\nThe vagina is self-cleansing, and douches have been\nknown to upset the balance of vaginal pH and flora, pro-moting vaginitis and other infections. Some studies havelinked excessive vaginal douching to increased incidenceof pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\nSide effects\nMost forms of hydrotherapy are well tolerated.\nThere is a risk of allergic reaction (also known as con-\ntact dermatitis ) for some patients using essential oils\nand herbs in their bath water. These individuals maywant to test for allergic sensitization to herbs by per-forming a skin patch test (i.e., rubbing a small amount ofdiluted herb on the inside of their elbow and observingthe spot for redness and irritation). People who experi-ence an allergic reaction to an essential oil should dis-continue its use and contact their healthcare professionalfor further guidance.\nThe most serious possible side effect of hydrothera-\npy is overheating, which may occur when an individualspends too much time in a hot tub or jacuzzi. However,when properly supervised, this is a minimal risk.\nResearch and general acceptance\nHydrotherapy treatments are used by both allo-\npathic and complementary medicine to treat a widevariety of discomforts and disorders. Not as wellaccepted are invasive hydrotherapy techniques, such ascolonic irrigation, enemas , and douching.

Itsoverproduction leads to retention of salt and loss of potas-sium, which leads to hypertension (high blood pressure).\nDescription\nAlso known as Conn’s syndrome, primary aldostero-\nnism, and secondary aldosteronism, this disorder takesseveral forms. It often begins with a tumor that producesaldosterone. In fact, approximately 60–70% of the casesof primary aldosteronism result from tumors in theadrenal gland area. Aldosterone is normally produced bythe adrenal cortex, or the outer portion of the gland thatrests on top of each kidney. Primary aldosteronism is dueto adenoma, a typically benign tumor in which the cellsform to act as glands or cause the glands on which theyrest to overproduce.

Obstructive renal arterydisease may also cause hypertension from elevated reninstimulating aldosterone. Oral contraceptives have been\nknown to increase the secretion of aldosterone in somepatients. This disorder is more common in women.\nCauses and symptoms\nHyperaldosteronism is most often caused by the inva-\nsion of adenoma. Other adrenal cancers and hyperplasia, orthe increase in the bulk of an organ due to increased cellproduction, may also cause hyperaldosteronism. Those dis-eases and factors influencing the adrenal and kidney func-tions may lead to secondary aldosteronism. The primarysymptom of hyperaldosteronism is moderate hypertension,or high blood pressure. In addition, a patient may experi-ence orthostatic hypotension , or reduced blood pressure\nwhen a person stands after lying down. Constipation ,\nmuscle weakness (sometimes to the point of periodic\nparalysis ), excessive urination, excessive thirst, headache ,\nand personality changes are also possible symptoms. Somepatients will show no obvious symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nScreening tests can be conducted to pinpoint a diag-\nnosis of hyperaldosteronism. If a patient is taking drugs toreduce high blood pressure, the physician may order thesedrugs stopped for a time period before conducting tests,since these drugs will affect results. Blood and urine testsmay be conducted to check for levels of aldosterone,potassium levels, or renin activity. A computed tomogra-phy scan (CT scan) may be ordered to detect tumors assmall as five to seven mm. These combined testsapproach 95% accuracy for detecting aldosterone-produc-ing adenoma. Laboratory findings recording blood pres-sure, edema , and aldosterone and plasma renin activity\ncan help the physician differentiate between primaryaldosteronism and secondary aldosteronism.\nTreatment\nOnce the physician has made a diagnosis of hyperal-\ndosteronism, the adrenal glands should be checked forpossible adenomas. This can be done through imaging orwith a surgical dissection of the gland. Surgical or abla-tive treatment will vary depending on the number oftumors found. Since more than 60% of hyperaldostero-nism cases are caused by these tumors, treatment of thetumors will help eliminate the resulting high blood pres-sure in many patients. Some patients will receive antihy-\npertensive drugs , like calcium channel blockers ,t o\ncontrol high blood pressure. The use of diuretics canKEY TERMS\nAblative —Used to describe a procedure involving\nremoval of a tissue or body part, or destruction ofits function.\nAdenoma —A growth of cells, usually a benign\ntumor, that forms a gland or gland-like substance.These tumors can secrete hormones or causechanges in hormone production in nearby glands.\nAdrenal —Refers to the glands which sit on top of\neach kidney and that secrete various hormones.\nAntihypertensive —Used to describe drugs or\ntreatments designed to control hypertension, orhigh blood pressure.\nDiuretic —A substance or drug that is taken to pro-\nmote the formation and release of urine.

Potassi-\num levels should be considered in the type of diureticordered and the levels should be checked throughouttreatment. The most widely used drug for treatment ofhyperaldosteronism is spironolactone. This drug helpscontrol aldosterone, but should not be prescribed forsome patients, especially those with certain kidney dis-eases. Spironolactone has several possible adverseeffects, depending on the dosage. In all cases of hyperal-dosteronism, the treatment should be carefully based onthe specific type or underlying cause of the disorder.\nAlternative treatment\nPatients may choose to work with their physician or\nalternative provider to control hypertension with diet,stress reduction (including massage, meditation ,\nbiofeedback , and yoga ), and other remedies. Blood pres-\nsure elevation needs to be controlled and monitored byfrequent blood pressure measurements. There is no alter-native treatment known for the underlying adenoma.\nPrognosis\nHyperaldosteronism carries with it all the possible\ncomplications of high blood pressure, including thicken-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1695Hyperaldosteronisming of arterial walls and a higher risk of angina , kidney\nfailure, stroke , or heart attack . Another possible, and\nless reversible complication than hypertension, is kidneydamage. When primary aldosteronism is caused by asolitary adenoma, the prognosis is good. Once this tumoris removed, blood pressure will drop, and 70% of thesepatients have full remission. Patients whose hyperaldos-teronism results from adrenal hyperplasia will remainhypertensive. However, in up to 70% of patients, bloodpressure can be reduced somewhat with drug therapy.Many patients will be faced with the prospect of control-ling their hypertension for the remainder of their lives.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention for most causes of\nhyperaldosteronism.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCurrent Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1996. 35th ed.

    "title": "Hypercalcemia",
    "content": "Hypercalcemia\nDefinition\nHypercalcemia is an abnormally high level of calci-\num in the blood, usually more than 10.5 milligrams perdeciliter of blood.\nDescription\nCalcium plays an important role in the development\nand maintenance of bones in the body. It is also neededin tooth formation and is important in other body func-tions. Normally, the body maintains a balance betweenthe amount of calcium in food sources and the calciumalready available in the body’s tissues. The balance canbe upset if excess amounts of calcium are eaten or if thebody is unable to process the mineral because of disease.\nCalcium is one of the most important and most\nabundant minerals in the human body. Dairy products\nare the major source of calcium. Eggs, green leafy veg-etables, broccoli, legumes, nuts, and whole grains pro-vide smaller amounts. Only about 10–30% of the calci-um in food is absorbed into the body. Most calcium isfound in combination with other dietary components andmust be broken down by the digestive system before itcan be used. Calcium is absorbed into the body in thesmall intestine. Its absorption is influenced by such fac-tors as the amount of vitamin D hormone available to aidthe process and the levels of calcium already present inthe body. As much as 99% of the body’s calcium isstored in bone tissue. A healthy person experiences aconstant turnover of calcium as bone tissue is built andreshaped. The remaining 1% of the body’s calcium circu-lates in the blood and other body fluids. Circulating cal-cium plays an important role in the control of many bodyfunctions, such as blood clotting, transmission of nerveimpulses, muscle contraction, and other metabolic activi-ties. In the bloodstream, calcium maintains a constantbalance with another mineral, phosphate.\nTwo main control agents are vital in maintaining cal-\ncium levels, vitamin D hormone and parathyroid hor-mone. A hormone is a chemical substance that is formedin one organ or part of the body and carried in the bloodto another organ. It can alter the function, and sometimesthe structure, of one or more organs.\n• Parathyroid hormone (PTH). The four parathyroid\nglands are endocrine glands located next to the thyroidgland in the neck. A gland is a cell or group of cells thatproduces a material substance (secretion). When thelevel of calcium circulating in the blood drops, theparathyroid gland releases its hormone. PTH then actsin three ways to restore the normal blood calcium level.It stimulates the absorption of more calcium in theintestine; it takes more calcium from the bone tissue,and it causes the kidneys to excrete more phosphate.\n• Vitamin D hormone. This hormone works with parathy-\nroid hormone to control calcium absorption and affectsthe deposit of calcium and phosphate in the bone tissue.\nThe kidneys also help to control calcium levels.\nHealthy kidneys can increase calcium excretion almost five-fold to maintain normal concentrations in the body. Hyper-calcemia can occur when the concentration of calcium over-whelms the ability of the kidneys to maintain balance.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1696HypercalcemiaCauses and symptoms\nCauses of hypercalcemia\nMany different conditions can cause hypercalcemia;\nthe most common are hyperparathyroidism and cancer .\nPRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM. Primary hyper-\nparathyroidism is the excessive secretion of parathyroidhormone by one or more of the parathyroid glands. It isthe most common cause of hypercalcemia in the generalpopulation. Women have this condition more frequentlythan men do, and it is more common in older people. Itcan appear thirty or more years after radiation treatmentsto the neck. Ninety percent of the cases of primaryhyperparathyroidism are caused by a non-malignantgrowth on the gland.\nHyperparathyroidism can also occur as part of a rare\nhereditary disease called multiple endocrine neoplasia.In this disease, tumors develop on the parathyroid gland.\nCANCER. People with cancer often have hypercal-\ncemia. In fact, it is the most common life-threateningmetabolic disorder associated with cancer. Ten to twentypercent of all persons with cancer have hypercalcemia.Cancers of the breast, lung, head and neck, and kidneyare frequently associated with hypercalcemia. It alsooccurs frequently in association with certain cancers ofthe blood, particularly malignant myeloma. It is seenmost often in patients with tumors of the lung (25–35%)and breast (20–40%), according to the National CancerInstitute. Cancer causes hypercalcemia in two ways.When a tumor grows into the bone, it destroys bony tis-sue (osteolysis). When the bone is not involved, factorssecreted by cancer cells can increase calcium levels(humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy). The two mech-anisms may operate at the same time.\nBecause immobility causes an increase in the loss of\ncalcium from bone, cancer patients who are weak and spendmost of their time in bed are more prone to hypercalcemia.Cancer patients are often dehydrated because they take ininadequate amounts of food and fluids and often suffer fromnausea and vomiting . Dehydration reduces the ability of\nthe kidneys to remove excess calcium from the body. Hor-mones and diuretics that increase the amount of fluid\nreleased by the body can also trigger hypercalcemia.\nOTHER CAUSES. Other conditions can cause hyper-\ncalcemia. Excessive intake of vitamin D increasesintestinal absorption of calcium. During therapy for pep-tic ulcers, abnormally high amounts of calcium antacids\nare sometimes taken. Overuse of antacids can causemilk-alkali syndrome and hypercalcemia. Diseases suchas Paget’s, in which bone is destroyed or reabsorbed, canalso cause hypercalcemia. As in cancer or paralysis ofthe arms and legs, any condition in which the patient is\nimmobilized for long periods of time can lead to hyper-calcemia due to bone loss.\nCommon symptoms\nMany patients with mild hypercalcemia have no\nsymptoms and the condition is discovered during routinelaboratory screening. Gastrointestinal symptoms includeloss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation , and\nabdominal pain. There may be a blockage in the bowel. If\nthe kidneys are involved, the individual will have to uri-nate frequently during both the day and night and will bevery thirsty. As the calcium levels rise, the symptomsbecome more serious. Stones may form in the kidneysand waste products can build up. Blood pressure rises.The heart rhythm may change. Muscles become increas-ingly weak. The individual may experience mood swings,confusion, psychosis , and eventually, coma and death .\nDiagnosis\nHigh levels of calcium in the blood are a good indica-\ntion of hypercalcemia, but these levels may fluctuate. Cal-cium levels are influenced by other compounds in theblood that may combine with calcium. Higher calcium andlower phosphate levels may suggest primary hyperparathy-roidism. The blood levels of protein (serum albumin) andparathyroid hormone (PTH) are also measured in the diag-nosis of hypercalcemia. Too much PTH in the blood mayindicate primary hyperparathyroidism. Levels of calciumand phosphate in the urine should also be measured. Themedical history and physical condition of the individualmust be taken into consideration, especially in the earlystages of hypercalcemia when symptoms are mild.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of hypercalcemia depends on how high\nthe calcium level is and what is causing the elevation.Hypercalcemia can be life-threatening and rapid reductionmay be necessary. If the patient has normal kidney func-tion, fluids can be given by vein (intravenously) to clearthe excess calcium. The amount of fluid taken in and elim-inated must be carefully monitored. If the patient’s kid-neys are not working well, acute hemodyalysis is probablythe safest and most effective method to reduce dangerouscalcium levels. In this procedure, blood is circulatedthrough tubes made of semi-permeable membranesagainst a special solution that filters out unwanted sub-stances before returning the blood to the body.\nDrugs such as furosemide, called loop diuretics, can\nbe given after adequate fluid intake is established. Thesedrugs inhibit calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1697Hypercalcemiapromote urine production. Drugs that inhibit bone loss,\nsuch as calcitonin, biphosphates, and plicamycin, arehelpful in achieving long-term control. Phosphate pillshelp lower high calcium levels caused by a deficiency inphosphate. Anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids arehelpful with some cancers and toxic levels of vitamin D.\nTreatment of the underlying cause of the hypercal-\ncemia will also correct the imbalance. Hyperparathy-roidism is usually treated by surgical removal of one ormore of the parathyroid glands and any tissue, other thanthe glands themselves, that is producing excessiveamounts of the hormone.\nThe hypercalcemia caused by cancer is difficult to\ntreat without controlling the cancer. Symptoms can bealleviated with fluids and drug therapy as outlined above.KEY TERMS\nCalcium —A silvery-yellow metal that is the basic\nelement of lime and makes up about 3% of theearth’s crust.

Outcome isalso influenced by whether any damage to the kidneyscan be reversed.\nMild hypercalcemia can be controlled through good\nfluid intake and the use of effective drugs.\nHypercalcemia generally develops as a late compli-\ncation of cancer and the expected outlook is grim withouteffective anticancer therapy.\nPrevention\nPeople with cancer who are at risk of developing\nhypercalcemia should be familiar with early symptomsand know when to see a doctor. Good fluid intake (up tofour quarts of liquid a day if possible), controlling nauseaand vomiting, paying attention to fevers, and keepingphysically active as much as possible can help preventproblems.

    "title": "Hypercholesterolemia",
    "content": "Hypercholesterolemia\nDefinition\nHypercholesterolemia refers to levels of cholesterol\nin the blood that are higher than normal.\nDescription\nCholesterol circulates in the blood stream. It is an\nessential molecule for the human body. Cholesterol is amolecule from which hormones and steroids are made. Itis also used to maintain nerve cells. Between 75 and 80%of the cholesterol that circulates in a person’s blood-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1698Hypercholesterolemiastream is made in that person’s liver. The remainder is\nacquired from outside sources. Cholesterol is found inanimal sources of food. It is not found in plants.\nNormal blood cholesterol level is a number derived by\nlaboratory analysis. A normal or desirable cholesterol levelis defined as less than 200 mg of cholesterol per deciliter ofblood (mg/dL). Blood cholesterol is considered to be bor-derline when it is in the range of 200 to 239 mg/dL. Elevat-ed cholesterol level is 240 mg/dL or above. Elevated bloodcholesterol is considered to be hypercholesterolemia.\nCholesterol has been divided into two major cate-\ngories: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the so-called“bad” cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL),the so-called “good” cholesterol. Diet, exercise ,smok-\ning, alcohol, and certain illnesses can affect the levels of\nboth types of cholesterol. Eating a high fat diet willincrease one’s level of LDL cholesterol. Exercising andreducing one’s weight will both increase HDL choles-terol and lower LDL cholesterol.\nThe most common cause of elevated serum choles-\nterol is eating foods that are rich in saturated fats or con-tain high levels of cholesterol. Elevated cholesterol canalso be caused by an underlying disease that raises bloodcholesterol levels such as diabetes mellitus , kidney dis-\nease, liver disease, or hypothyroidism . It can also be\ncaused by an inherited disorder in which cholesterol isnot metabolized properly by the body. Obesity , which\ngenerally results from eating a diet high in fat, can alsolead to elevated cholesterol levels in the blood. This isbecause obesity itself leads the body to produce exces-sive amounts of cholesterol.\nHypercholesterolemia increases the risk of heart dis-\nease. Elevated levels of circulating cholesterol causedeposits to form inside blood vessels. These deposits,called plaque, are composed of fats deposited from thebloodstream. When the deposits become sufficientlylarge, they block blood vessels and decrease the flow ofblood. These deposits result in a disease process calledatherosclerosis , which can cause blood clots to form that\nwill ultimately totally stop blood flow. If this happens inthe arteries supplying the heart, a heart attack will\noccur. If it happens in the brain, the result is a stroke\nwhere a portion of brain tissue dies. Atherosclerosiscauses more deaths from heart disease than any other sin-gle condition. Heart disease has been the leading causeof death in the United States for the past half century.\nThere is a syndrome called familial hypercholes-\nterolemia. Affected persons have consistently high levels ofLDL. This leads to early clogging of the coronary arteries.In turn this leads to a heart attack. Among affected males, afirst heart attack typically occurs in their 40s to 50s.Approximately 85% of men with this disorder have experi-enced a heart attack by the time they reach 60 years of age.\nThe incidence of heart attacks among women with this dis-order is also increased. However, it is delayed 10 yearscompared to men. The incidence of familial hypercholes-terolemia is seven out of 1,000 people.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypercholesterolemia is silent. There are no symp-\ntoms that are obvious to the naked eye. It is diagnosed bya blood test or after a heart attack or stroke occurs.\nDiagnosis\nHypercholesterolemia is diagnosed by using a blood\ntest. A blood specimen obtained after not eating or drink-ing anything (except water) for 12 hours. The fasting is\ndone to determine the LDL and HDL cholesterol, whichcan only be determined accurately in a fasting state.Most experts agree on an acceptable limit for LDL cho-lesterol as 130 mg/dL. Total cholesterol of under 200mg/dL for is thought to be in an acceptable range.\nTreatment\nIf an individual’s cholesterol is elevated, discussions\nwith a physician should be scheduled to determine whatcourse of treatment may be needed. Initial treatment forhypercholesterolemia usually requires dietary changes toreduce the intake of total fat, saturated fat, and choles-terol. Most health care professionals will recommend thata person’s weight and height be proportionate. Further,experts counsel persons with elevated blood cholesterollevels to increase their intake of soluble fiber. Sources ofsoluble fiber include bran, foods containing whole grainsand other sources of indigestible fiber such as lignin.\nThe reason for treating elevated cholesterol is to\nreduce an individual’s risk of complications. If a diet lowin cholesterol and saturated fats doesn’t significantlyreduce a person’s cholesterol level, medication may berequired. For every 1 percent reduction in cholesterollevel, the risk of heart disease is reduced by 2 percent. Itis also possible to partially reverse atherosclerosis thathas already occurred by aggressively lowering choles-terol levels with diet and medications.\nPrescription drugs are available to help lower cho-\nlesterol levels in the blood. Niacin, cholestyramine,cholestipol, lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvast-stin and gemfibrazol have all been approved for use inthe United States as of 2001.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are advocates of treatment using vitamins ,min-\nerals and antioxidant substances in relatively high amounts.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1699HypercholesterolemiaThese amounts generally exceed those provided by the\nFood and Drug Administration in its Minimum DailyRequirements (MDR). Advocates of such therapies alsoinclude increased levels of exercise, attaining an ideal bodyweight and increasing levels of fiber in one’s diet.\nSome people have advocated the use of garlic, soy\nand isoflavones to lower serum cholesterol levels.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for persons is in direct proportion to\ntheir serum cholesterol levels. Persons with hypercholes-terolemia are at high risk of dying from heart disease orstroke.\nMany studies have looked at the relationship between\nelevated cholesterol levels, increased risk for heart attackand death. In one research investigation of relativelyyoung males who had no known heart disease, cholesterollevels were measured and participants were followed for6 years. During this time, all heart attacks and deaths thatoccurred among participants were recorded. As serumcholesterol levels increased, so did the risk of experienc-ing a fatal heart attack. The risk of a fatal heart attack wasapproximately five times higher among persons havingcholesterol levels of 300 mg/dL or more compared tothose with cholesterol levels below 200 mg/dL.\nThe Framingham Heart Study is an ongoing research\neffort. Cholesterol levels, smoking habits, heart attackrates, and deaths in the population of an entire town havebeen recorded for over 40 years. After 30 years, morethan 85% of persons with cholesterol levels of 180 mg/dLor less were still alive; almost a third of those with choles-terol levels greater than 260 mg/dL had died.KEY TERMS\nAtherosclerosis —A disease process whereby\nplaques of fatty substances are deposited insidearteries, reducing the inside diameter of the ves-sels and eventually causing damage to the tissueslocated beyond the site of the blockage.\nCoronary artery —One of five vessels that supply\nblood to the heart.\nDeciliter (dL) —100 cubic centimeters (cc).\nHigh density lipoprotein (HDL) —A fraction of\ntotal serum lipids, the so called “good” cholesterol.\nLow density lipoprotein (LDL) —A fraction of total\nserum lipids, the so called “bad” cholesterol.Prevention\nExperts suggest the following steps to maintain\nserum cholesterol within normal limits: an importantcomponent is to maintain a normal weight for height andreducing one’s weight if it is inappropriate for height.Change dietary habits by reducing the amount of fat andcholesterol consumed. Avoid smoking by not starting orquitting if currently a smoker. Increase levels of fiber inthe diet by including foods such as beans, raw fruits,whole grains and vegetables. It is important to exerciseon a regular basis. Aerobic exercise is especially helpfulin reducing serum cholesterol levels.\nPersons from families with a strong history of early\nheart attacks should be evaluated with a lipid screen.Proper diet, exercise and the use of effective drugs canreduce serum lipid levels.\nNutrition and cardiac experts offer the following\nsuggestions:\n• purchase low-fat or fat-free dairy products such as\nmilk, cheese, sour cream, and yogurt\n• eat lean red meats, chicken without skin, and fish• reduce consumption of foods high in saturated fat such\nas french fries\n• avoid foods that are rich sources of cholesterol such as\neggs, liver, cheese, and bacon\n• eat smaller servings• keep a food journal and write down everything you eat\nevery day\n• prepare food by microwaving, boiling, broiling, or bak-\ning food instead of frying\n• trim the fat from meat before cooking it.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBraunwald, Eugene, Douglas Zipes, and Perter Libby.

    "title": "Hypercoagulation disorders",
    "content": "Hypercoagulation disorders\nDefinition\nHypercoagulation disorders (or hypercoagulable\nstates or disorders) have the opposite effect of the morecommon coagulation disorders . In hypercoagulation,\nthere is an increased tendency for clotting of the blood,which may put a patient at risk for obstruction of veinsand arteries (phlebitis or pulmonary embolism ).\nDescription\nIn normal hemostasis, or the stoppage of bleeding,\nclots form at the site of the blood vessel’s injury. The dif-ference between that sort of clotting and the clotting pre-sent in hypercoagulation is that these clots develop in cir-culating blood.\nThis disorder can cause clots throughout the body’s\nblood vessels, sometimes creating a condition known asthrombosis. Thrombosis can lead to infarction, or deathof tissue, as a result of blocked blood supply to the tissue.\nHowever, hypercoagulability does not always lead tothrombosis. In pregnancy , and other hypercoagulable\nstates, the incidence of thrombosis is higher than that ofthe general population, but is still under 10%. However,in association with certain genetic disorders, hypercoag-ulation disorders may be more likely to lead to thrombo-sis. Hypercoagulation disorders may also be known ashyperhomocystinemia, antithrombin III deficiency, fac-tor V leyden, and protein C or protein S deficiency.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypercoagulation disorders may be acquired or\nhereditary. Some of the genetic disorders that lead tohypercoagulation are abnormal clotting factor V , varia-tions in fibrinogen, and deficiencies in proteins C and S.Other body system diseases may also lead to these disor-ders, including diabetes, sickle cell anemia, congenital\nheart disease , lupus, thalassemia , polycythemia rubra\nvera, and others. Antithrombin III deficiency is a heredi-tary hypercoagulation disorder that affects both sexes.Symptoms include obstruction of a blood vessel by a clot(thromboembolic disease), vein inflammation (phlebitis),and ulcers of the lower parts of the legs. The role of pro-teins C and S is a complex one. In order for coagulationto occur, platelets (small, round fragments in the blood)help contract blood vessels to lessen blood loss and alsoto help plug damaged blood vessels. However, the con-version of platelets into actual clots is a complicated webinvolving proteins that are identified clotting factors. Thefactors are carried in the plasma, or liquid portion of theblood. Proteins C and S are two of the clotting factorsthat are present in the plasma to help regulate or activateparts of the clotting process. Protein C is considered ananticoagulant. Mutation defects in the proteins maydecrease their concentrations in the blood, and may ormay not affect their resulting anticoagulant activity. Fac-tor V is an unstable clotting factor also present in plasma.Abnormal factor V resists the changes that normallyoccur through the influence of protein C, which can alsolead to hypercoagulability. Prothrombin, a glycoproteinthat converts to thrombin in the early stage of the clottingprocess, is affected by the presence of these proteins, aswell as other clotting factors.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of hypercoagulation disorders is com-\npleted with a combination of physical examination ,\nmedical history, and blood tests.

    "content": "Hyperemesis gravidarum\nDefinition\nHyperemesis gravidarum means excessive vomiting\nduring pregnancy .\nDescription\nIn pregnant women, nausea and vomiting (morning\nsickness) are common, affecting up to 80% of pregnan-cies. Hyperemesis, or extreme nausea and excessivevomiting, occur in about 1% of pregnancies. This condi-tion causes uncontrollable vomiting, severedehydration , and weight loss for the mother. However,\nhyperemesis gravidarum rarely causes problems for theunborn baby.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy\nis unknown but may be related to the level of certainhormones produced during pregnancy. Hyperemesis isseen more often in first pregnancies and multiple preg-nancies (twins, triplets, etc.). The main symptom ofhyperemesis is severe vomiting, which causes dehydra-tion and weight loss.\nDiagnosis\nAlthough many women with morning sickness feel\nlike they are vomiting everything they eat, they continueto gain weight and are not dehydrated; they do not havehyperemesis gravidarum. Women with this condition willstart to show signs of starvation , including weight loss.\nPhysical examination and laboratory tests of blood and\nurine samples will be used to help diagnose the condi-tion. One of the most common tests used to help diagno-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1702Hyperemesis gravidarumsis and monitor hyperemesis gravidarum is a test for\nketones in the urine. Excessive ketones in the urine(ketonuria) indicate that the body is not using carbohy-drates from food as fuel and is inadequately trying tobreak down fat as fuel. Ketonuria is a sign that the bodyis beginning to operate in starvation mode.\nTreatment\nHospitalization is often required. Intravenous fluids\nwith substances that help the body conduct nerve signals(electrolytes) may be given to correct the dehydrationand excessive acid in the blood (acidosis). Anti-nausea orsedative medications may be given by injection to stopthe vomiting. In some cases, oral medication may be pre-scribed to control the nausea and vomiting while food isreintroduced. If food cannot be tolerated at all, intra-venous nutritional supplements may be necessary. Injec-tions of vitamin B\n6, in particular, may help overcome\nnutritional deficiencies that often occur.\nAlternative treatment\nThe severe vomiting associated with hyperemesis\ngravidarum requires medical attention. Milder episodesof nausea or vomiting may be reduced with deep breath-ing and relaxation exercises. The use of herbal remediesshould be done with extreme caution during pregnancy,especially in the first trimester. Natural remedies toreduce nausea include a teaspoon of cider vinegar in acup of warm water, or tea made from anise ( Pinpinella\nanisum ), fennel seed ( Foeniculum vulgare ), red raspberry\n(Rubus idaeus ), or ginger ( Zingiber officinale ). Wrist-\nbands can be positioned over acupressure points on both\nwrists. Aromatherapy with lavender, rose, or\nchamomile can be soothing, as can smelling ground gin-ger. Homeopathic remedies—which use extremely dilut-ed solutions as treatments—can be safe and effective forcontrolling symptoms in some women.\nPrognosis\nIn virtually all cases, the pregnancy can continue to\nthe successful delivery of a healthy baby.\nPrevention\nAlthough there is no evidence that hyperemesis\ngravidarum can be prevented, vomiting during pregnancysometimes may be lessened. Maintaining a healthy diet,getting adequate sleep, and controlling stress may con-\ntribute to prevention or improvement of symptoms. Sev-eral strategies may help lessen the nausea and vomiting.Eating dry foods and limiting fluid intake may also beKEY TERMS\nKetonuria —The presence of large amount of\nketones in the urine.

Hyper-hidrosis may also contribute to such skin diseases as ath-\nlete’s foot (tinea pedis) and contact dermatitis .\nCauses and symptoms\nConditions or situations that can trigger hyperhidro-\nsis are varied. They include stressful situations, eatingspicy foods, consuming alcohol, the presence of underly-ing disorders (e.g. tuberculosis ,malaria , lymphoma, and\ndiabetes), menopause , hormonal imbalances, and the use\nof certain drugs. Physicians believe that hyperhidrosis canbe linked to a breakdown in communication between thebrain and the mechanisms that activate sweating.

    "title": "Hyperkalemia",
    "content": "Hyperkalemia\nDefinition\nThe normal concentration of potassium in the\nserum is in the range of 3.5 to 5.0 mM. Hyperkalemiarefers to serum or plasma levels of potassium ionsabove 5.0 mM. The concentration of potassium is oftenexpressed in units of milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L),rather than in units of millimolarity (mM). Both unitsmean the same thing when applied to concentrations ofpotassium ions.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1704HyperkalemiaDescription\nA normal adult who weighs about 70 kg contains a\ntotal of about 3.6 moles of potassium ions in the body.Most of this potassium (about 98%) occurs inside vari-ous cells and organs, where its concentration is about 150mM. This level is in contrast to the much lower concen-tration found in the blood serum, where only about 0.4%of the body’s potassium resides. Hyperkalemia can becaused by an overall excess of body potassium, or by ashift from inside to outside cells. For example, hyper-kalemia can be caused by the sudden release of potassi-um ions from muscle into the surrounding fluids.\nIn a normal person, hyperkalemia from too much\npotassium in the diet is prevented by at least three typesof regulatory processes. First, various cells and organsact to prevent hyperkalemia by taking up potassium fromthe blood. It is also prevented by the action of the kid-neys, which excrete potassium into the urine. A third pro-tective mechanism is vomiting. Consumption of a largedose of potassium ions, such as potassium chloride,induces a vomiting reflex to expel most of the potassiumbefore it can be absorbed.\nCauses and symptoms\nHyperkalemia can occur from a variety of causes,\nincluding the consumption of too much of a potassiumsalt; the failure of the kidneys to normally excrete potas-sium ions into the urine; the leakage of potassium fromcells and tissues into the bloodstream; and from acidosis.The most common cause of hyperkalemia is kidney (orrenal) disease, which accounts for about three quarters ofall cases. Kidney function is measured by the glomerularfiltration rate, the rate at which each kidney performs itscontinual processing and cleansing of blood. The normalglomerular filtration rate is about 100 ml/min. If the kid-ney is damaged so that the glomerular filtration rate isonly 5 ml/min or less, hyperkalemia may result, especial-ly if high-potassium foods are consumed. The elderly areat particular risk, since many regulatory functions of thebody do not work well in this population. Elderlypatients who are being treated with certain drugs for highblood pressure, such as spironolactone (Aldactone) andtriamterene (Dyazide), must especially be monitored forpossible hyperkalemia, as these medications promote theretention of potassium by the kidneys.\nHyperkalemia can also be caused by a disease of the\nadrenal gland called Addison’s disease . The adrenal\ngland produces the hormone aldosterone that promotesthe excretion of potassium into the urine by the kidney.\nHyperkalemia can also result from injury to muscle\nor other tissues. Since most of the potassium in the bodyKEY TERMS\nAcidosis —An abnormally high acid (hydrogen\nion) concentration in blood plasma. The unit ofacid content is pH, with a lower value indicatingmore acidic conditions. Blood plasma normallyhas a pH of 7.35–7.45. Alkaline blood has a pHvalue greater than pH 7.45. When the blood pHvalue is less than 7.35, the patient is in acidosis.\nis contained in muscle, a severe trauma that crushes mus-\ncle cells results in an immediate increase in the concen-tration of potassium in the blood. Hyperkalemia mayalso result from severe burns or infections.\nAcidic blood plasma, or acidosis, is an occasional\ncause of hyperkalemia. Acidosis, which occurs in a num-ber of diseases, is defined as an increase in the concen-tration of hydrogen ions in the bloodstream. In thebody’s attempt to correct the situation, hydrogen is takenup by muscle cells out of the blood in an exchange mech-anism involving the transfer of potassium ions into thebloodstream. This can abnormally elevate the plasma’sconcentration of potassium ions. When acidosis is thecause of hyperkalemia, treating the patient for acidosishas two benefits: a reversal of both the acidosis and thehyperkalemia.\nSymptoms of hyperkalemia include abnormalities in\nthe behavior of the heart. Heart abnormalities of mildhyperkalemia (5.0 to 6.5 mM potassium) can be detectedby an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). With severehyperkalemia (over 8.0 mM potassium), the heart maybeat at a dangerously rapid rate (fibrillation) or stop beat-ing entirely (cardiac arrest). Patients with moderate orsevere hyperkalemia may also develop nervous symp-toms such as tingling of the skin, numbness of the handsor feet, weakness, or a flaccid paralysis , which is char-\nacteristic of both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia (low\nplasma potassium).\nDiagnosis\nHyperkalemia can be measured by acquiring a sam-\nple of blood, preparing blood serum, and using a potassi-um sensitive electrode for measuring the concentrationof potassium ions. Alternatively, atomic absorption spec-troscopy can be used for measuring potassium. Sincehigh or low potassium levels result in abnormalities inheart function, the electrocardiogram is usually themethod of choice for the diagnosis of both hyperkalemiaand hypokalemia.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1705HyperkalemiaTreatment\nInsulin injections are used to treat hyperkalemia in\nemergency situations. Insulin is a hormone well knownfor its ability to stimulate the entry of sugar (glucose)into cells. It also provokes the uptake of potassium ionsby cells, decreasing potassium ion concentration in theblood. When insulin is used to treat hyperkalemia, glu-cose is also injected. Serum potassium levels begin todecline within 30 to 60 minutes and remain low for sev-eral hours. In non-emergency situations, hyperkalemiacan be treated with a low potassium diet. If this does notsucceed, the patient can be given a special resin to bindpotassium ions. One such resin, sodium polystyrene sul-fonate (Kayexalate), remains in the intestines, where itabsorbs potassium and forms a complex of resin andpotassium. Eventually this complex is excreted in thefeces. A typical dose of resin is 15 grams, taken one tofour times per day. The correction of hyperkalemia withresin treatment takes at least 24 hours.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for specifically correcting hyper-\nkalemia is excellent. However, hyperkalemia is usuallycaused by kidney failure, an often irreversible and even-tually fatal condition.\nPrevention\nHealthy people are not at risk for hyperkalemia.\nPatients with renal disease and those on certain diureticmedications must be monitored to prevent its occurrence.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe American Dietetic Association.

    "title": "Hyperlipidemia seeHyperlipoproteinemiaHyperlipoproteinemia",
    "content": "Hyperlipidemia seeHyperlipoproteinemiaHyperlipoproteinemia\nDefinition\nHyperlipoproteinemia occurs when there is too\nmuch lipid (fat) in the blood. Shorter terms that mean thesame thing are hyperlipidemia and hyperlipemia. Dys-lipidemia refers to a redistribution of cholesterol fromone place to another that increases the risk of vasculardisease without increasing the total amount of choles-terol. When more precise terms are needed, hypercho-\nlesterolemia and hypertriglycericemia are used.\nDescription\nIt is commonly known that oil and water do not mix\nunless another substance like a detergent is added. Yet thebody needs to transport both lipids (fats) and water-basedblood within a single circulatory system. There must be away to mix the two, so that essential fatty nutrients can betransported in the blood and so that fatty waste productscan be carried away from tissues. The solution is to com-bine the lipids with protein to form water-soluble pack-ages that can be transported in the blood.\nThese packages of fats are called lipoproteins. They\nare a complex mixture of triglycerides, cholesterol, phos-pholipids and special proteins. Some of these chemicalsare fatty nutrients absorbed from the intestines on theirway to being made part of the body. Cholesterol is a wasteproduct on its way out of the body through the liver, thebile, and ultimately the bowel for excretion. The proteinsand phospholipids make the packages water-soluble.\nThere are five different sizes of these chemical pack-\nages. Each package needs all four chemicals in it to holdeverything in solution. They differ in how much of eachthey contain. If blood serum is spun very rapidly in anultracentrifuge, these five packages will layer out accord-ing to their density. They have, therefore, been namedaccording to their densities—high-density lipoproteins(HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), very low density lipoproteins(VLDL), and chylomicrons. Only the HDLs and theLDLs will be discussed in the rest of this article.\nIf there is not enough detergent in the laundry, the\noily stains will remain in the clothes. In the same way, ifthe balance of chemicals in these packages is not right,cholesterol will stay in tissues rather than being excretedfrom the body. What is even worse, if the chemical com-position of these packages changes, the cholesterol canfall out of the blood and stay where it lands. On the otherhand, a different change in the balance can remove cho-lesterol from tissues where there is too much. This\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1706Hyperlipoproteinemiaappears to be exactly what is going on in atherosclerosis .\nThe lesions contain lots of cholesterol.\nThe LDLs are overloaded with cholesterol. A minor\nchange in the other chemicals in this package will leavecholesterol behind. The HDLs have a third to a half asmuch cholesterol. They seem to be able to pick up cho-lesterol left behind by the LDLs. It seems that atheroscle-rosis begins with tiny tears at stressed places in the wallsof the arteries. Low density lipoproteins from the bloodenter these tears, where their chemistry changes enoughto leave cholesterol behind. The cholesterol causes irrita-tion; the body responds with inflammation; damage andscarring follow. Eventually the artery gets so diseasedblood cannot flow through it. Strokes and heart attacksare the result.\nBut if there are lots of HDLs in the blood, the cho-\nlesterol is rapidly picked up and not allowed to causeproblems. Women before menopause have estrogen (the\nfemale hormone), which encourages the formation ofHDLs. This is the reason they have so little vascular dis-ease, and why they rapidly catch up to men aftermenopause, when estrogen levels fall. Replacement ofestrogen after menopause sustains the protection throughthe later years.\nCholesterol is the root of the problem, but like any\nother root it cannot just be eliminated. Ninety percent ofthe cholesterol in the body is created there as a wasteproduct of necessary processes. The solution lies in get-ting it out to the body without clogging the arteries.\nOf course the story is much more complex. The\nbody has dozens of chemical processes that make up,break down, and reconfigure all these chemicals. It isthese processes that are the targets of intervention in theeffort to cure vascular disease.\nDiseases\nNear the dawn of concern over cholesterol and vas-\ncular disease a family of hereditary diseases was identi-fied, all of which produced abnormal quantities of bloodfats. These diseases were called dyslipoproteinemias andcame in both too much and too little varieties. The hyper-lipoproteinemias found their way into five categories,depending on which chemical was in excess.\n• Type 1 has a pure elevation of triglycerides in the chy-\nlomicron fraction. These people sometimes get pancre-\natitis and abdominal pains, but they do not seem to\nhave an increase in vascular disease.\n• Type 2 appears in two distinct genetic patterns and a\nthird category, which is by far the most important kind,because everyone is at risk for it. All Type 2s have ele-vated cholesterol. Some have elevated triglyceridesKEY TERMS\nAtherosclerosis —Hardening of the arteries due to\nfat (cholesterol) deposits in their walls. Alsoknown as arteriosclerosis .\nGenetic —Refers to the genes, characteristics\ninherited from parents.\nInflammation —The body’s response to irritation,\nby releasing chemicals that attack germs and tis-sues and also repair the damage done.\nLesion —Localized disease or damage.\nPancreatitis —Inflammation of the pancreas.\nSerum —The liquid part of blood, from which all\nthe cells have been removed.\nalso. The familial (genetic) versions of Type 2 often\ndevelop xanthomas, which are yellow fatty depositsunder the skin of the knuckles, elbows, buttocks orheels. They may also have xanthelasmas, smaller yel-low patches on the eyelids.\n• Type 3 appears in one in 10,000 people and elevates\nboth triglycerides and cholesterol with consequent vas-cular disease.\n• Type 4 elevates only triglycerides and does not increase\nthe risk of vascular disease.\n• Type 5 is similar to Type 1.• Dyslipidemia refers to a normal amount of cholesterol\nthat is mostly in LDLs, where it causes problems.\nAll but Type 2 are rare and of interest primarily\nbecause they give insight into the chemistry of bloodfats.\nIn addition to the above genetic causes of blood fat\ndisorders, a number of acquired conditions can raiselipoprotein levels.\n• Diabetes mellitus, because it alters the way the body\nhandles its energy needs, also affects the way it handlesfats. The result is elevated triglycerides and reducedHDL cholesterol. This effect is amplified by obesity .\n• Hypothyroidism is a common cause of lipid abnormali-\nties. The thyroid hormone affects the rate of manychemical processes in the body, including the clearingof fats from the blood. The consequence is usually anelevation of cholesterol.\n• Kidney disease affects the blood’s proteins and conse-\nquently the composition of the fat packages. It usuallyraises the LDLs.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1707Hyperlipoproteinemia• Liver disease, depending on its stage and severity, can\nraise or lower any of the blood fats.\n• Alcohol raises triglycerides. In moderate amounts (if\nthey are very moderate) it raises HDLs and can be ben-eficial.\n• Cigarette smoking lowers HDL cholesterol, as does\nmalnutrition and obesity.\nCertain medications elevate blood fat levels. Because\nsome of these medications are used to treat heart disease,it has been necessary to reevaluate their usefulness:\n• Thiazides, water pills used to treat high blood pressure,\ncan raise both cholesterol and triglycerides.\n• Beta-blockers, another class of medication used to treat\nhigh blood pressure, cortisone-like drugs, and estrogencan raise triglycerides.\n• Progesterone, the pregnancy hormone, raises choles-\nterol.\nNot all of these effects are necessarily bad, nor are\nthey necessarily even significant. For instance, estrogenis clearly beneficial. Each effect must be considered inthe overall goal of treatment.\nCauses and symptoms\nA combination of heredity and diet is responsible for\nthe majority of fat disorders. It is not so much the choles-terol in the diet that is the problem, because that accountsfor only 10% of the body’s store. It is the other fats in thediet that alter the way the body handles its cholesterol.There is a convincing relation between fats in the dietand the incidence of atherosclerosis. The guilty fats aremostly the animal fats, but palm and coconut oil are alsoharmful. These fats are called saturated fats for the chem-ical reason that most of their carbon atoms have as manyhydrogen atoms attached as they can accommodate.More important than the kind of fat is the amount of fat.For many people, fat is half of their diet. A quarter to afifth is a much healthier fraction, the rest of the dietbeing made up of complex carbohydrates and protein.\nThis disease is silent for decades, until the first\nepisode of heart disease or stroke .\nDiagnosis\nIt would be easier if simple cholesterol and triglyc-\neride tests were all it took to assess the risk of atheroscle-rosis. But the important information is which packagethe cholesterol is in—the LDLs or the HDLs. That takesa more elaborate testing process. To complicate mattersfurther, the amount of fats in the blood varies greatly inrelation to the last meal—how long ago it was and whatkind of food was eaten. A true estimate of the risk comes\nfrom several tests several weeks apart all done after atleast twelve hours of fasting .\nTreatment\nDiet and lifestyle change are the primary focus for\nmost cholesterol problems. It is a mistake to think that apill will reverse the effects of a bad diet, obesity, smok-ing, excess alcohol, stress , and inactivity. Reducing the\namount of fat in the diet by at least half is the mostimportant move to make. Much of the food eaten to satis-fy a “sweet tooth” is higher in fat than in sugar. A switchaway from saturated fats is the next step, but the rush topolyunsaturated fats was ill-conceived. These, and par-ticularly the hydrogenated fats in margarine, have prob-lems of their own. They raise the risk of cancer and are\nconsidered more dangerous than animal fat by manyexperts. Theory supports population studies that suggestmonounsaturated olive oil may be the healthiest of all.\nThere was a tremendous push at the end of the 20th\ncentury to use lipid-lowering medications. The most pop-ular and most expensive agents, the “statins,” hinder thebody’s production of cholesterol and sometimes damagethe liver as a side effect. Their full name is 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coemzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase\ninhibitors. Their generic names are cervistatin, fluvas-tatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. Studiesshow that these do lower cholesterol. Only recently,though, has any e vidence appeared that this affects health\nand longevity. Earlier studies showed, in fact, an increaseddeath rate among users of the first class of lipid-altering\nagents—the fibric acid derivatives. The chain of eventsconnecting raised HDL and lowered LDL cholesterol tolonger, healthier lives is still to be forged.\nHigh-tech methods of rapidly reducing very high\nblood fat levels are performed for those rare disordersthat require it. There are resins that bind cholesterol inthe intestines. They taste awful, feel like glue and rou-tinely cause gas, bloating, and constipation . For acute\ncases, there is a filtering system that takes fats directlyout of the blood.\nNiacin (nicotinic acid) lowers cholesterol very effec-\ntively and was the first medication proven to improveoverall life expectancy. It can also be liver toxic, and theusual formulation causes a hot flash in many people. Thiscan be overcome by taking a couple of aspirins half-an-hour before the niacin, or by taking a special preparationcalled “flush free,” “inositol-bound” or inositol hexani-cotinate. Omega-3 oil is a special kind found mostly incertain kinds of fish. It is beneficial in lowering choles-terol. An herbal alternative called gugulipid, Commipho-\nra mukul , an extract of an Indian plant, is supposed to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1708Hyperlipoproteinemiawork the same way as the expensive and liver toxic cho-\nlesterol-lowering medications.\nAlternative treatment\nTo lower cholesterol, naturopathic medicine ,tra-\nditional Chinese medicine , and ayurvedic medicine\nmay be considered. Some herbal therapies includegugulipid, alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ), Asian ginseng\n(Panax ginseng ), and fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum-\ngraecum ). Garlic ( Allium sativum ) and onions are also\nreported to have cholesterol-lowering effects. In naturo-pathic medicine, the liver is considered to be an organthat needs cleansing and rebalancing. The liver is oftentreated with a botanical formula that will act as a bitter tostimulate bile flow in the liver. Before initiating alterna-tive therapies, medical consultation is strongly advised.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis is good for Type 1 hyperlipoproteine-\nmia with treatment; without treatment, death may result.For Type 2 the prognosis is poor even with treatment.The prognosis for type 3 is good when the prescribed dietis strictly followed. For types 4 and 5 the prognosis isuncertain, due to the risk of developing premature coro-\nnary artery disease and pancreatitis, respectively.\nPrevention\nGenetic inheritance cannot be changed, but its effects\nmay be modified with proper treatment. Family membersof an individual with hyperlipoproteinemia should con-sider having their blood lipids assessed. The sooner anyproblems are identified, the better the chances of limitingor preventing the associated health risks. Anyone with afamily history of disorders leading to hyperlipoproteine-mia also may benefit from genetic testing and counseling\nto assist them in making reproductive decisions.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGinsberg, Henry N., and Ira J.

    "title": "Hypernatremia",
    "content": "Hypernatremia\nDefinition\nThe normal concentration of sodium in the blood\nplasma is 136–145 mM. Hypernatremia is defined as aserum sodium level over 145 mM. Severe hypernatremia,with serum sodium above 152 mM, can result in seizuresand death .\nDescription\nSodium is an atom, or ion, that carries a single posi-\ntive charge. The sodium ion may be abbreviated as Na+or\nas simply Na. Sodium can occur as a salt in a crystallinesolid. Sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium phosphate(Na\n2HPO 4) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) are com-\nmonly occurring salts. These salts can be dissolved inwater or in juices of various foods. Dissolving involvesthe complete separation of ions, such as sodium andchloride in common table salt (NaCl).\nAbout 40% of the body’s sodium is contained in\nbone. Approximately 2–5% occurs within organs andcells and the remaining 55% is in blood plasma and otherextracellular fluids. The amount of sodium in blood plas-ma is typically 140 mM, a much higher amount than isfound in intracellular sodium (about 5 mM). This asym-metric distribution of sodium ions is essential for humanlife. It makes possible proper nerve conduction, the pas-sage of various nutrients into cells, and the maintenanceof blood pressure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1709HypernatremiaThe body continually regulates its handling of sodi-\num. When dietary sodium is too high or low, theintestines and kidneys respond to adjust concentrationsto normal. During the course of a day, the intestinesabsorb dietary sodium while the kidneys excrete a nearlyequal amount of sodium into the urine. If a low sodiumdiet is consumed, the intestines increase their efficiencyof sodium absorption, and the kidneys reduce its releaseinto urine.\nThe concentration of sodium in the blood plasma\ndepends on two things: the total amount of sodium andwater in arteries, veins, and capillaries (the circulatory sys-tem). The body uses separate mechanisms to regulate sodi-um and water, but they work together to correct bloodpressure when it is too high or too low. Too high a concen-tration of sodium, or hypernatremia, can be correctedeither by decreasing sodium or by increasing body water.The existence of separate mechanisms that regulate sodi-um concentration account for the fact that there are numer-ous diseases that can cause hypernatremia, including dis-eases of the kidney, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus.\nCauses and symptoms\nVasopressin, also called anti-diuretic hormone, is\nmade by the hypothalamus and released by the pituitarygland into the bloodstream. There it travels to the kidneywhere it reduces the release of water into the urine. Withless vasopressin production, the body fails to conservewater, and the result is a trend toward higher plasmasodium concentrations. Hypernatremia may occur in dia-\nbetes insipidus , a disease that causes excessive urine\nproduction. (It is not the same disease as diabetes melli-\ntus, a disease resulting from impaired insulin produc-\ntion.) The defect involves either the failure of the hypo-KEY TERMS\nBlood plasma and serum —Blood plasma, or plas-\nma, is prepared by obtaining a sample of bloodand removing the blood cells. The red blood cellsand white blood cells are removed by spinningwith a centrifuge. Chemicals are added to preventthe blood’s natural tendency clot. If these chemi-cals include sodium, then a false measurement ofplasma sodium content will result. Serum is pre-pared by obtaining a blood sample, allowing for-mation of the blood clot, and removing the clotusing a centrifuge. Both plasma and serum arelight yellow in color.thalamus to make vasopressin or the failure of the kidney\nto respond to vasopressin. In either case, the kidney isable to conserve and regulate the body’s sodium levels,but is unable to conserve and retain the body’s water.Hypernatremia does not occur in diabetes insipidus if thepatient is able to drink enough water to keep up with uri-nary loss, which may be as high as 10 liters per day.\nHypernatremia may occur in unconscious (or\ncomatose) patients due to the inability to drink water. Wateris continually lost by evaporation from the lungs and in theurine. If the patient is not given water via infusion, the sodi-um concentration in the blood may increase and hyperna-tremia could develop. Hypernatremia can also occur in rarediseases in which the thirst impulse is impaired.\nHypernatremia can also occur accidentally in the\nhospital when patients are infused with solutions con-taining sodium, such as sodium bicarbonate for the treat-ment of acidosis (acidic blood). It can also be accidental-ly induced with sodium chloride infusions, especially inelderly patients with impaired kidney function.\nHypernatremia can cause neurological damage due to\nshrinkage of brain cells. Neurological symptoms includeconfusion, coma ,paralysis of the lung muscles, and\ndeath. The severity of the symptoms is related to howrapidly the hypernatremia developed. Hypernatremia thatcomes on rapidly does not allow the cells of the brain timeto adapt to their new high-sodium environment. Hyperna-tremia is especially dangerous for children and the elderly.\nDiagnosis\nHypernatremia is diagnosed by acquiring a blood\nsample, preparing plasma, and using a sodium-sensitiveelectrode for measuring the concentration of sodium ions.\nTreatment\nHypernatremia is treated with infusions of a solution\nof water containing 0.9% sodium chloride (0.9 gramsNaCl/100 ml water), which is the normal concentrationof sodium chloride in the blood plasma. The infusion isperformed over many hours or days to prevent abrupt anddangerous changes in brain cell volume. In emergencies,such as when hypernatremia is causing neurologicalsymptoms, infusions may be conducted with salt solu-tions containing 0.45% sodium chloride, which is halfthe normal physiologic level.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for treating hypernatremia is excellent,\nexcept if neurological symptoms are severe or if overlyrapid attempts are made to treat and reverse the condition.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1710HypernatremiaPrevention\nHypernatremia occurs only in unusual circum-\nstances that are not normally under a person’s control.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

    "title": "Hyperopia",
    "content": "Hyperopia\nDefinition\nHyperopia (farsightedness) is the condition of the\neye where incoming rays of light reach the retina beforethey converge into a focused image.\nDescription\nWhen light goes through transparent but dense mate-\nrial like the materials of the eye’s lens system (the lensand cornea), its velocity decreases. If the surface of thedense material is not perpendicular to the incoming light,as is the case with the curved surfaces on lenses andcorneas, the direction of the light changes. The greaterthe curvature of the lens system, the greater the change inthe direction of the light.\nWhen parallel light rays from an object go through\nthe lens system of the eye, they are bent so they con-verge at a point some distance behind the lens. With per-fect vision this point of convergence, where the lightrays are focused, is on the retina. This happens when thecumulative curvature of the lens plus cornea and the dis-tance from the lens to the retina are just right for eachother. The condition where the point of focus of parallellight rays from an object is behind the retina is calledhyperopia. This condition exists when the combinedcurvature of the lens and cornea is insufficient (e.g., flat-ter than needed for the length of the eyeball). This con-dition can be equivalently described by saying hyper-opia exists when the eyeball is too short for the curva-ture of its lens system.\nThere is a connection between the focusing of the\nlens of the eye (accommodation) and convergence of theeyes (the two eyes turning in to point at a close object.)The best example is during reading. The lens accommo-dates to make the close-up material clear and the eyesturn in to look at the print and keep it single. Because ofthis connection between accommodation and conver-gence, if the lens needs to accommodate to focus for dis-tance (to bring the image back onto the retina) the eyesmay appear to turn in even when looking at the distance.This can cause a condition known as accommodativeesotropia in children. The eyes turn in and the cause isaccommodation because of hyperopia.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1711Hyperopia\nLight\n Hyperopia (farsightedness)Cornea\nLensLightRetina\nNormal eye\nHyperopia, or farsightedness, is a condition of the eye where\nincoming rays of light impinge on the retina before converg-ing into a focused image, resulting in difficulty seeing near-by objects clearly. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Causes and symptoms\nBabies are generally born slightly hyperopic. This\ntends to decrease with age. There is normal variation ineyeball length and curvature of the lens and cornea. Somecombinations of these variables give rise to eyes where thecornea is too flat for the distance between the cornea andthe retina. If the hyperopia is not too severe the lens maybe able to accommodate and bring the image back onto theretina. This would result in clear distance vision, but theconstant focusing might result in headaches or eyestrain. Ifthe lens cannot accommodate for the full amount of thehyperopia the distance image would be blurry.\nIf the eyes are focusing for distance and now the per-\nson is looking at a near object, the eyes need to accom-modate further. This may result in blurry near objects orheadaches during near work.\nDepending upon the amount of hyperopia, symp-\ntoms can range from none to clear distance vision butblurry near vision, to blurry distance and near vision.Headaches and eyestrain may also occur, particularlywhen doing near tasks. An eye turned in (esotropia) maybe a result of hyperopia, particularly in children. Howev-er, because a turned eye may be a result of more seriouscauses it is very important to have it checked out.\nDiagnosis\nBecause it is possible to have good visual acuity\nwith some degree of hyperopia it is important to relaxKEY TERMS\nCornea —The clear, dome-shaped outer covering\nof the front of the eye.

This is done with\nthe use of eyedrops and is called a cycloplegic exam orcycloplegic refraction. The drops relax the accommoda-tion (thus making reading blurry until the drops wearoff). Patients will usually be asked to have someone drivethem home because of the blurriness. The doctor canthen determine the patient’s visual status with a hand-held instrument called a retinoscope and/or have thepatient read from an eye chart while placing differentlenses in front of the patient’s eyes. Refractive error ismeasured in units called diopters (D).\nTreatment\nThe usual treatment for hyperopia is corrective lens-\nes (spectacles or contact lenses).\nDifferent surgical methods to correct hyperopia are\nunder investigation. One approach is to implant correc-tive contact lenses behind the patient’s iris. The firstexperimental implantable contact lenses were implant-ed in 1997. Another approach is to surgically increasethe curvature of the eye’s existing cornea or lens.Although there have been many reports of successusing different kinds of lasers to increase corneal curva-ture, as of 1998 there are still problems with stabilityand predictability. The introduction of light-activatedbiologic tissue glue in 1997 holds promise for improve-ments in those areas.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for fully corrected vision is excellent\nfor patients with low to moderate amounts of hyperopia.Patients with very high hyperopia (+10.00D or more)may not achieve full correction. Moreover, surgery tocorrect hyperopia will probably be perfected andapproved in the near future.\nHyperopia increases the chances of chronic glauco-\nma, but vision loss from glaucoma is preventable.\nPrevention\nHyperopia is usually present at birth, and there is no\nknown way to prevent it.\nResources\nBOOKS\nNewell, Frank W.

    "title": "Hyperparathyroidism",
    "content": "Hyperparathyroidism\nDefinition\nParathyroid glands are four pea-sized glands located\njust behind the thyroid gland in the front of the neck. Thefunction of parathyroid glands is to produce a hormonecalled parathyroid hormone (parathormone), which helpsregulate calcium and phosphorous in the body. Hyper-parathyroidism is the overproduction of this hormone.\nDescription\nThyroid glands and parathyroid glands, despite their\nsimilar name and proximity, are entirely separate, andeach produces hormones with different functions. Hyper-parathyroidism may be primary or secondary. It mostoften occurs in those over age 30, and most commonly inpatients 50 to 60 years old. It rarely occurs in children orthe elderly. Women are affected by the disease up to threetimes more often than men. It is estimated that 28 ofevery 100,000 people in the United States will develophyperparathyroidism each year.\nNormally, parathyroid glands produce the parathor-\nmone as calcium levels drop and lower to meet thedemands of a growing skeleton, pregnancy , or lactation .\nHowever, when one or more parathyroid glands malfunc-tions, it can lead to overproduction of the hormone andelevated calcium level in the blood. Therefore, a commonresult of hyperparathyroidism is hypercalcemia , or an\nabnormally high level of calcium in the blood. Primaryhyperparathyroidism occurs as a malfunction of one ofthe glands, usually as a result of a benign tumor, calledadenoma. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs as theresult of a metabolic abnormality outside the parathyroidglands, which causes a resistance to the function of theparathyroid hormones. Primary hyperparathyroidism isone of the most common endocrine disorders, led only bydiabetes and hyperthyroidism .\nCauses and symptoms\nOften, there are no obvious symptoms or suspicion\nof hyperparathyroidism, and it is first diagnosed when apatient is discovered to be hypercalcemic during a rou-tine blood chemistry profile. Patients may believe theyhave felt fine, but realize improvements in sleep, irritabil-ity, and memory following treatment. When symptomsare present, they may include development of gastriculcers or pancreatitis because high calcium levels can\ncause inflammation and pain in the linings of the stom-\nach and pancreas.\nMost of the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism are\nthose present as a result of hypercalcemia, such as kidney\nstones ,osteoporosis , or bone degradation resulting from\nthe bones giving up calcium. Muscle weakness, centralnervous system disturbances such as depression, psy-chomotor and personality disturbances, and rarely, evencoma can occur. Patients may also experience heartburn ,\nnausea, constipation , or abdominal pain. In secondary\nhyperparathyroidism, patients may show signs of calciumimbalance such as deformities of the long bones. Symp-toms of the underlying disease may also be present.\nMost commonly, hyperparathyroidism occurs as the\nresult of a single adenoma, or benign tumor, in one of theparathyroid glands. About 90% of all cases of hyper-parathyroidism are caused by an adenoma. The tumors areseldom cancerous. They will grow to a much larger sizethan the parathyroid glands, often to the size of a walnut.Genetic disorders or multiple endocrine tumors can alsocause a parathyroid gland to enlarge and oversecrete hor-mone. In 10% or fewer of patients with primary hyper-parathyroidism, there is enlargement of all four parathyroidglands. This condition is called parathyroid hyperplasia.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is most often\nmade when a blood test (radioimmunoassay) revealshigh levels of parathyroid hormone and calcium. A bloodtest that specifically measures the amount of parathyroidhormone has made diagnosis simpler. X ray examina-tions may be performed to look for areas of diffuse bonedemineralization, bone cysts, outer bone absorption anderosion of the long bones of the fingers and toes. Hyper-calcemia is mild or intermittent in some patients, but isan excellent indicator of primary hyperparathyroidism.Dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA), atool used to diagnose and measure osteoporosis, is usedto show reduction in bone mass for primary hyper-parathryroidism patients. Once a diagnosis of hyper-parathyroidism is reached, the physician will probablyorder further tests to evaluate complications. For exam-ple, abdominal radiographs might reveal kidney stones.\nFor secondary hyperparathyroidism, normal or\nslightly decreased calcium levels in the blood and vari-able phosphorous levels may be visible. Patient history\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1713Hyperparathyroidismof familial kidney disease or convulsive disorders may\nsuggest a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism.Other tests may reveal a disease or disorder, which iscausing the secondary hyperparathyroidism.\nTreatment\nHyperparathyroidism cases will usually be referred\nto an endocrinologist, a physician specializing in hor-monal problems, or a nephrologist, who specializes inkidney and mineral disorders.\nPatients with mild cases of hyperparathyroidism\nmay not need immediate treatment if they have onlyslight elevations in blood calcium level and normal kid-neys and bones. These patients should be regularlychecked, probably as often as every six months, by phys-\nical examination and measurement of kidney function\nand calcium levels. A bone densitometry measurementshould be performed every one or two years. After sever-al years with no worsened symptoms, the length of timebetween exams may be increased.\nPatients with more advanced hyperparathyroidism\nwill usually have all or half of the affected parathyroidgland or glands surgically removed. This surgery is rela-tively safe and effective. The primary risks are thoseassociated with general anesthesia. There are someinstances when the surgery can be performed with thepatient under regional, or cervical block, anesthesia.Often studies such as ultrasonography prior to surgeryhelp pinpoint the affected areas.\nAlternative treatment\nForcing fluids and reducing intake of calcium-rich\nfoods can help decrease calcium levels prior to surgery orif surgery is not necessary.\nPrognosis\nRemoval of the enlarged parathyroid gland or glands\ncures the disease 95% of the time and relief of bone painKEY TERMS\nDemineralization —A loss or decrease of minerals\nin the bones.\nEndocrine —Glands and hormone secretions in\nthe body circulation.\nPhosphorous —Referring to a chemical element\noccurring in all living cells.may occur in as few as three days. In up to 5% of patients\nundergoing surgery, chronically low calcium levels mayresult, and these patients will require calcium supple-ment or vitamin D treatment. Damage to the kidneys as aresult of hyperparathyroidism is often irreversible. Prog-nosis is generally good, however complications of hyper-parathyroidism such as osteoporosis, bone fractures ,\nkidney stones, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and nervoussystem difficulties may worsen prognosis.\nPrevention\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism may be prevented\nby early treatment of the disease causing it. Early recog-nition and treatment of hyperparathyroidism may preventhypercalcemia. Since the cause of primary hyperparathy-roidism, or the adenoma which causes parathyroid en-largement, is largely unknown, there are not prescribedprevention methods.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nAllerheiligen, David A., et al. “Hyperparathyroidism.” Ameri-\ncan Family Physician 58 (15 Apr.1998): 1795-1803.\nORGANIZATIONS\nOsteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases-National Resource\nCenter. 1150 17th S.

Melanin production is stimulated by apituitary hormone called melanocyte stimulating hor-mone (MSH). Other pigments appear in the skin muchless often.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1714HyperpigmentationCauses and symptoms\nDarkened spots on the skin come in several varieties.\nThe most ominous is malignant melanoma , a very\naggressive cancer that begins as an innocent mole. The\nmajority of moles (nevus), however, are and remain\nbenign (harmless). The average person has severaldozen, and certain people with a hereditary excess mayhave hundreds. Freckles, age spots, and cafe au lait spots,known as ephelides, are always flat and not as dark. Cafeau lait spots are seen mostly in people with anotherhereditary disorder called neurofibromatosis . “Port\nwine stains” are congenital dark red blotches on the skin.Other common dark colorations on the skin are calledkeratosis and consist of locally overgrown layers of skinthat are dark primarily because there is more tissue thannormal. A few of these turn into skin cancers of a muchless dangerous kind than melanoma.\nDarkened regions of the skin occur as a result of\nabnormal tanning when the skin is sensitive to sun-light. Several diseases and many drugs can cause pho-\ntosensitivity . Among the common drugs responsible\nfor this uncommon reaction are birth control pills,antibiotics (sulfonamides and tetracyclines ),diuret-\nics,nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID),\npain relievers, and some psychoactive medications.\nSome of the same drugs may also cause patches of dis-colored skin known as localized drug reactions andrepresenting an allergy to that drug.

A condition known as acanthosisnigricans is a velvety darkening of skin in folded areas(arm pits, groin, and neck) that can signal a cancer orhormone imbalance.\nOf particular note is a condition called melasma\n(dark pigmentation of the skin), caused by the femalehormone estrogen. Normal in pregnancy , this brownish\ndiscoloration of the face can also happen with birth con-trol pills that contain estrogen.\nOverall darkening of the skin may be due to pig-\nmented chemicals in the skin. Silver, gold, and iron eachhave a characteristic color when visible in the skin. Sev-eral drugs and body chemicals, like bilirubin, can end upas deposits in the skin and discolor it.\nThere are a number of other rare entities that color\nthe skin, each in its own peculiar way.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD\nHyperprolactation seeGalactorrhea\nHypersensitivity\npneumonitis\nDefinition\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis refers to an inflamma-\ntion of the lungs caused by repeated breathing in of a for-eign substance, such an organic dust, a fungus, or a mold.The body’s immune system reacts to these substances,called antigens, by forming antibodies, molecules thatattack the invading antigen and try to destroy it. Thecombination of antigen and antibody produces acuteinflammation, or pneumonitis (a hypersensitivity reac-tion), which later can develop into chronic lung diseasethat impairs the lungs’ ability to take oxygen from the airand eliminate carbon dioxide.Description\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is sometimes\ncalled “allergic alveolitis.” “Allergic” refers to the anti-gen-antibody reaction, and “alveolitis” means an inflam-mation of the tiny air sacs in the lungs where oxygen andCO\n2are exchanged, the alveoli. It also is known as\n“extrinsic” allergic alveolitis, meaning that the antigenthat sets up the allergic reaction (also called an allergen)comes from the outside. Most of the antigens that causethis disease come from plant or animal proteins ormicroorganisms, and many of those affected are exposedeither at work or in the course of some hobby or otheractivity. The first known type of HP, farmer’s lung, iscaused by antigens from tiny microorganisms living onmoldy hay. An example of disease connected with ahobby is pigeon breeder’s lung, caused by inhaling pro-tein material from bird droppings or feathers. After atime, very little of the allergenic material is needed to setoff a reaction in the lungs.\nRoughly one in every 10,000 persons develops some\nform of HP. A mysterious aspect of this condition is that,even though many persons may be exposed to a particularantigen, only a small number of them will develop thedisease. Genetic differences may determine who becomesill; this remains unclear. Probably between 5% and 15%of all persons who are regularly exposed to organic mate-rials develop HP. Most of those who do get it do not\nsmoke ( smoking may create the type of cells that take up\nantigens and neutralize them). The amount of antigen isan important factor in whether HP will develop and whatform it will take. Sudden heavy exposure can producesymptoms in a matter of hours, whereas mild but frequentexposures tend to produce a long-lasting, “smoldering”illness. HP may be more likely to develop in personsexposed to polluted air or industrial fumes.\nTypical changes occur in the lungs of persons with\nHP. In the acute stage, large numbers of inflammatorycells are found throughout the lungs and the air sacs maybe filled by a thick fluid mixed with these cells. In thesubacute stage, disease extends into the small breathingtubes, or bronchioles, and the inflammatory cells collectinto tiny granules called granulomas. Finally, in thechronic stage of HP, the previously inflamed parts of thelungs become scarred and unable to function, as in pul-\nmonary fibrosis .\nCauses and symptoms\nA number of different types of HP are known, since a\nwide range of allergens may produce an allergic reactionin the lungs. Many of them produce similar symptomsand abnormal physical findings, but some have their owntypical features. Some of the more common forms are:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1716Hypersensitivity• Farmer’s lung. Can affect any farmer who works with\nwet hay or other moldy dust. Small farmers who haveto directly thresh and handle their hay are most at risk,as are those living in cold and humid areas where dampweather is common.\n• Pigeon breeder’s lung. Also called “bird fancier’s lung,”\nit is second to farmer’s lung as the best known type ofHP. A substance has been found in pigeon droppingsthat may cause the allergic reaction, but there may bemore than one such substance. Besides pigeons, the dis-order may follow exposure to ducks, geese, pheasants,and even canaries. Parakeets produce an especiallysevere form of disease. Most patients are middle-agedwomen, who usually care for birds either at home or onbird breeding farms.\n• Bagassosis. Caused by bagasse, a substance produced\nwhen juice is extracted from sugar cane and is used inmaking paper and explosives. A fungus is probablyresponsible. Young and middle-aged men who work inthe sugar industry are at risk.\n• Byssinosis. A similar condition affecting workers who\ninhale dust from cotton, flax, or hemp.\n• Humidifier lung. An acute form of HP caused by inhal-\ning actinomycyetes, the same organisms that causefarmer’s lung, which grow in contaminated humidifiervents, air conditioners, heating systems, and even saunas.\n• Other antigens. HP has been seen in persons working\nwith detergents, silicone, mushrooms, cheese, wooddust, maple bark, coffee, and furs.\nIn the acute stage, patients with HP begin coughing,\ndevelop fever , and note tightness in the chest as well as\nextreme tiredness and aching, four to eight hours afterthe most recent exposure. Most patients are well aware ofthe connection between their work (or an activity) andtheir symptoms. After a time, patients may have troublebreathing. They also may lose their appetite, lose weight,and generally feel ill. Finally, in the chronic stage, thepatient will have increasing trouble breathing and maysometimes wheeze. With advanced disease, the skin mayappear bluish (because too little oxygen is getting intothe blood). When the physician listens to the patient’schest with a stethoscope, there may be crackling soundsor loud wheezing . In the late stages, club-shaped finger-\ntips are a sign that the patient has not been gettingenough oxygen for an extended period of time.\nDiagnosis\nNo single test can make a definite diagnosis of HP.\nThe key is to relate some specific exposure or activity toepisodes of symptoms. The chest x ray may be normal\nin the acute stage, but later may show a hazy appearancethat looks like “ground glass.” There may be linear or\nrounded shadows in the central parts of the lungs. Studiesof lung function in the acute stage typically show abnor-mally small lung volume. The ability to breathe at a fastrate is impaired. Blood from an artery typically has a lowlevel of oxygen. Later, when the lungs have begun toscar, the airways (breathing tubes) are obstructed and therate of air flow is reduced.\nSome experts believe that skin testing can help diag-\nnose HP and show which particular antigen is causingthe symptoms. Small amounts of several suspect antigensare injected just beneath the surface of the skin, usuallyon the arm or back, and the reactions compared to thatcaused by injecting a harmless salt solution. Anotherdiagnostic test is to place a thin tube into the airways,inject a small amount of fluid, and draw it back up (bron-choalveolar lavage). A very large number of cells calledlymphocytes is typical of HP, and mast cells, which arepart of the immune system, may also be seen. Rarely, atissue sample (biopsy) of lung tissue may be takenthrough a tube placed in the airways and examined undera microscope. Finally, a patient may be “challenged” byactually inhaling a particular antigen in the form of anaerosol and noting whether lung function suddenlybecomes worse. This test is usually not necessary.\nTreatment\nTreatment of HP requires identifying the offending\nantigen and avoiding further exposure. Although it maysometimes be necessary for a patient to find a totally differ-ent type of work, often it is possible to simply perform dif-ferent duties or switch to a work site where exposure isminimal. In some cases, (like pigeon breeder’s lung), wear-ing a mask can prevent exposure. If acute symptoms aresevere, the patient may be treated with a steroid hormonefor two to six weeks. This often suppresses the inflammato-ry response and allows the lungs a chance to recover. In thechronic stage, steroid treatment can delay further damageto the lungs and help preserve their function.\nPrognosis\nIn general, most of the symptoms of HP disappear\nwhen the patient is no longer exposed to the causativeallergen. The actual chances of complete recoverydepend in part on what form of HP is present. Olderpatients and those exposed repeatedly for long periodsafter initially developing symptoms tend to have a poorerlong-term outlook. The worst outcome is that longrepeated episodes of exposure will cause chronic lunginflammation, scar the lungs, and permanently make thenunable to properly provide oxygen to the blood. Rarely, apatient will become permanently disabled.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1717HypersensitivityPrevention\nIt is often not possible to prevent initial episodes of\nHP, because there is no way of predicting which individ-uals (such as farmers) will have an allergic reaction to aparticular allergen. Once the connection is made betweena type of exposure and definite hypersensitivity symp-toms, prevention of further episodes is simple as long asfurther exposure can be avoided.\nExactly how to avoid exposure depends on a per-\nson’s work or activities and what he or she is reacting to.People with farmer’s lung can dry hay thoroughly beforestoring it. For pigeon breeder’s lung (and many othertypes of HP), a mask can be worn. In many industrial set-tings, it is possible to take precautions that will limit theamount of allergen that workers will inhale. If it is notpossible to avoid exposure altogether, exposure can betimed and strictly minimized.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSmolley, Lawrence A., and Debra F. Bryse.

    "content": "Hypersplenism\nDefinition\nHypersplenism is a type of disorder which causes\nthe spleen to rapidly and prematurely destroy blood cells.\nDescription\nThe spleen is located in the upper left area of the\nabdomen. One of this organ’s major functions is to removeblood cells from the body’s bloodstream. In hyper-splenism, its normal function accelerates, and it begins toautomatically remove cells that may still be normal infunction. Sometimes, the spleen will temporarily holdonto up to 90% of the body’s platelets and 45% of the redblood cells. Hypersplenism may occur as a primary dis-ease, leading to other complications, or as a secondary dis-ease, resulting from an underlying disease or disorder.Hypersplenism is sometimes referred to as enlarged spleen(splenomegaly). An enlarged spleen is one of the symp-toms of hypersplenism. What differentiates hypersplenismis its premature destruction of blood cells.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypersplenism may be caused by a variety of disor-\nders. Sometimes, it is brought on by a problem within thespleen itself and is referred to as primary hypersplenism.Secondary hypersplenism results from another diseasesuch as chronic malaria ,rheumatoid arthritis ,tuber-\nculosis , or polycythemia vera , a blood disorder. Spleen\ndisorders in general are almost always secondary innature. Hypersplenism may also be caused by tumors.\nSymptoms of hypersplenism include easy bruising,\neasy contracting of bacterial diseases, fever , weakness,\nheart palpitations , and ulcerations of the mouth, legs\nand feet. Individuals may also bleed unexpectedly and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1718Hypersplenismheavily from the nose or other mucous membranes, and\nfrom the gastrointestinal or urinary tracts. Most patientswill develop an enlarged spleen, anemia, leukopenia, orabnormally low white blood cell counts, or thrombocy-\ntopenia , a deficiency of circulating platelets in the blood.\nOther symptoms may be present that reflect the underly-ing disease that has caused hypersplenism.\nAn enlarged spleen can be caused by a variety of\ndiseases, including hemolytic anemia , liver cirrhosis ,\nleukemia, malignant lymphoma and other infections andinflammatory diseases. Splenomegaly occurs in about10% of systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Some-\ntimes, it is caused by recent viral infection, such asmononucleosis. An enlarged spleen may cause pain in\nthe upper left side of the abdomen and a premature feel-ing of fullness at meals.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of hypersplenism begins with review of\nsymptoms and patient history, and careful feeling (palpa-tion) of the spleen. Sometimes, a physician can feel anenlarged spleen. X-ray studies, such as ultrasound and com-puted tomography scan (CT scan), may help diagnose anenlarged spleen and possible underlying causes, such astumors. Blood tests indicate decreases in white blood cells,red blood cells, or platelets. Another test measures red bloodcells in the liver and spleen after injection of a radioactivesubstance, and indicates areas where the spleen is holdingon to large numbers of red cells or is destroying them.\nEnlarged spleens are diagnosed using a combination\nof patient history, physical examination , including palpa-\ntion of the spleen, if possible, and diagnostic tests. A histo-ry of fever and systemic symptoms may be presentbecause of infection, malaria, or an inflammatory disorder.A complete blood count is taken to check counts of young\nred blood cells. Liver function tests , CT scans, and ultra-\nsound exams can also help to detect an enlarged spleen.\nTreatment\nIn secondary hypersplenism, the underlying disease\nmust be treated to prevent further sequestration ordestruction of blood cells, and possible spleen enlarge-ment. Those therapies will be tried prior to removal ofthe spleen ( splenectomy ), which is avoided if possible.\nIn severe cases, the spleen must be removed. Splenecto-my will correct the effects of low blood cell concentra-tions in the blood.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis depends on the underlying cause and pro-\ngression of the disease.

Blood pressure\nis the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteriesas it flows through them. Arteries are the blood vesselsthat carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the body’stissues.\nDescription\nAs blood flows through arteries it pushes against the\ninside of the artery walls. The more pressure the bloodexerts on the artery walls, the higher the blood pressurewill be. The size of small arteries also affects the bloodpressure. When the muscular walls of arteries arerelaxed, or dilated, the pressure of the blood flowingthrough them is lower than when the artery walls narrow,or constrict.\nBlood pressure is highest when the heart beats to\npush blood out into the arteries. When the heart relaxesto fill with blood again, the pressure is at its lowest point.Blood pressure when the heart beats is called systolicpressure. Blood pressure when the heart is at rest iscalled diastolic pressure. When blood pressure is mea-sured, the systolic pressure is stated first and the diastolicpressure second. Blood pressure is measured in millime-ters of mercury (mm Hg). For example, if a person’s sys-tolic pressure is 120 and diastolic pressure is 80, it iswritten as 120/80 mm Hg. The American Heart Associa-tion considers blood pressure less than 140 over 90 nor-mal for adults.\nHypertension is a major health problem, especially\nbecause it has no symptoms. Many people have hyper-tension without knowing it. In the United States, about50 million people age six and older have high blood pres-sure. Hypertension is more common in men than womenand in people over the age of 65 than in younger persons.More than half of all Americans over the age of 65 havehypertension. It is also more common in African-Ameri-cans than in white Americans.\nHypertension is serious because people with the\ncondition have a higher risk for heart disease and othermedical problems than people with normal blood pres-sure. Serious complications can be avoided by gettingregular blood pressure checks and treating hypertensionas soon as it is diagnosed.\nIf left untreated, hypertension can lead to the follow-\ning medical conditions:\n• arteriosclerosis, also called atherosclerosis\n•heart attack•stroke\n• enlarged heart\n• kidney damage\nArteriosclerosis is hardening of the arteries. The\nwalls of arteries have a layer of muscle and elastic tissuethat makes them flexible and able to dilate and constrictas blood flows through them. High blood pressure canmake the artery walls thicken and harden. When arterywalls thicken, the inside of the blood vessel narrows.Cholesterol and fats are more likely to build up on thewalls of damaged arteries, making them even narrower.Blood clots can also get trapped in narrowed arteries,blocking the flow of blood.\nArteries narrowed by arteriosclerosis may not deliv-\ner enough blood to organs and other tissues. Reduced orblocked blood flow to the heart can cause a heart attack.If an artery to the brain is blocked, a stroke can result.\nHypertension makes the heart work harder to pump\nblood through the body. The extra workload can makethe heart muscle thicken and stretch. When the heartbecomes too enlarged it cannot pump enough blood. Ifthe hypertension is not treated, the heart may fail.\nThe kidneys remove the body’s wastes from the\nblood. If hypertension thickens the arteries to the kidneys,less waste can be filtered from the blood. As the conditionworsens, the kidneys fail and wastes build up in the blood.Dialysis or a kidney transplant are needed when the kid-neys fail. About 25% of people who receive kidney dial-\nysishave kidney failure caused by hypertension.\nCauses and symptoms\nMany different actions or situations can normally\nraise blood pressure. Physical activity can temporarilyraise blood pressure. Stressful situations can make bloodpressure go up. When the stress goes away, blood pressure\nusually returns to normal. These temporary increases inblood pressure are not considered hypertension. A diagno-sis of hypertension is made only when a person has multi-ple high blood pressure readings over a period of time.\nThe cause of hypertension is not known in 90 to 95\npercent of the people who have it. Hypertension without aknown cause is called primary or essential hypertension.\nWhen a person has hypertension caused by another\nmedical condition, it is called secondary hypertension.Secondary hypertension can be caused by a number ofdifferent illnesses. Many people with kidney disordershave secondary hypertension. The kidneys regulate thebalance of salt and water in the body. If the kidneys can-not rid the body of excess salt and water, blood pressuregoes up. Kidney infections, a narrowing of the arteries\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1720Hypertensionthat carry blood to the kidneys, called renal artery\nstenosis , and other kidney disorders can disturb the salt\nand water balance.\nCushing’s syndrome and tumors of the pituitary\nand adrenal glands often increase levels of the adrenalgland hormones cortisol, adrenalin, and aldosterone,which can cause hypertension. Other conditions that cancause hypertension are blood vessel diseases, thyroidgland disorders, some prescribed drugs, alcoholism, and\npregnancy .\nEven though the cause of most hypertension is not\nknown, some people have risk factors that give them agreater chance of getting hypertension. Many of theserisk factors can be changed to lower the chance of devel-oping hypertension or as part of a treatment program tolower blood pressure.\nRisk factors for hypertension include:\n• age over 60• male sex• race• heredity\n• salt sensitivity\n• obesity• inactive lifestyle• heavy alcohol consumption\n• use of oral contraceptives\nSome risk factors for getting hypertension can be\nchanged, while others cannot. Age, male sex, and raceare risk factors that a person can’t do anything about.Some people inherit a tendency to get hypertension. Peo-ple with family members who have hypertension aremore likely to develop it than those whose relatives arenot hypertensive. A person with these risk factors canavoid or eliminate the other risk factors to lower theirchance of developing hypertension.\nDiagnosis\nBecause hypertension doesn’t cause symptoms, it is\nimportant to have blood pressure checked regularly. Bloodpressure is measured with an instrument called a sphyg-momanometer. A cloth-covered rubber cuff is wrappedaround the upper arm and inflated. When the cuff is inflat-ed, an artery in the arm is squeezed to momentarily stopthe flow of blood. Then, the air is let out of the cuff while astethoscope placed over the artery is used to detect thesound of the blood spurting back through the artery. Thisfirst sound is the systolic pressure, the pressure when theheart beats. The last sound heard as the rest of the air isreleased is the diastolic pressure, the pressure between\nheart beats. Both sounds are recorded on the mercurygauge on the sphygmomanometer.\nNormal blood pressure is defined by a range of val-\nues. Blood pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg is consid-ered normal. A blood pressure around 120/80 mm Hg isconsidered the best level to avoid heart disease. A num-ber of factors such as pain , stress or anxiety can cause a\ntemporary increase in blood pressure. For this reason,hypertension is not diagnosed on one high blood pressurereading. If a blood pressure reading is 140/90 or higherfor the first time, the physician will have the personreturn for another blood pressure check. Diagnosis ofhypertension usually is made based on two or more read-ings after the first visit.\nSystolic hypertension of the elderly is common and\nis diagnosed when the diastolic pressure is normal orlow, but the systolic is elevated, e.g.170/70 mm Hg. Thiscondition usually co-exists with hardening of the arteries(atherosclerosis).\nBlood pressure measurements are classified in\nstages, according to severity:\n• normal blood pressure: less than 130/85 mm Hg• high normal: 130–139/85–89 mm Hg• mild hypertension: 140–159/90–99 mm Hg• moderate hypertension: 160–179/100–109 mm Hg\n• severe hypertension: 180–209/110–119\n• very severe hypertension: 210/120 or higher\nA typical physical examination to evaluate hyper-\ntension includes:\n• medical and family history\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1721Hypertension\nThe effects of hypertension on the heart and kidney.

Reproduced bypermission.)• physical examination\n• ophthalmoscopy: Examination of the blood vessels in\nthe eye\n•chest x ray\n• electrocardiograph (ECG)\n• blood and urine tests\nThe medical and family history help the physician\ndetermine if the patient has any conditions or disordersthat might contribute to or cause the hypertension. Afamily history of hypertension might suggest a geneticpredisposition for hypertension.\nThe physical exam may include several blood pres-\nsure readings at different times and in different positions.The physician uses a stethoscope to listen to soundsmade by the heart and blood flowing through the arteries.The pulse, reflexes, and height and weight are checkedand recorded. Internal organs are palpated, or felt, todetermine if they are enlarged.\nBecause hypertension can cause damage to the\nblood vessels in the eyes, the eyes may be checked with ainstrument called an ophthalmoscope. The physician willlook for thickening, narrowing, or hemorrhages in theblood vessels.\nA chest x ray can detect an enlarged heart, other vas-\ncular (heart) abnormalities, or lung disease.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical\nactivity of the heart. It can detect if the heart muscle isenlarged and if there is damage to the heart muscle fromblocked arteries.\nUrine and blood tests may be done to evaluate health\nand to detect the presence of disorders that might causehypertension.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for primary hypertension, but blood\npressure can almost always be lowered with the correcttreatment. The goal of treatment is to lower blood pres-sure to levels that will prevent heart disease and othercomplications of hypertension. In secondary hyperten-sion, the disease that is responsible for the hypertensionis treated in addition to the hypertension itself. Success-ful treatment of the underlying disorder may cure thesecondary hypertension.\nTreatment to lower blood pressure usually includes\nchanges in diet, getting regular exercise , and taking anti-\nhypertensive medications. Patients with mild or moder-ate hypertension who don’t have damage to the heart orkidneys may first be treated with lifestyle changes.\nLifestyle changes that may reduce blood pressure by\nabout 5 to 10 mm Hg include:• reducing salt intake\n• reducing fat intake• losing weight\n• getting regular exercise\n• quitting smoking\n• reducing alcohol consumption• managing stress\nPatients whose blood pressure remains higher than\n139/90 will most likely be advised to take antihyperten-sive medication. Numerous drugs have been developedto treat hypertension. The choice of medication willdepend on the stage of hypertension, side effects, othermedical conditions the patient may have, and other medi-cines the patient is taking.\nPatients with mild or moderate hypertension are ini-\ntially treated with monotherapy, a single antihypertensivemedicine. If treatment with a single medicine fails tolower blood pressure enough, a different medicine maybe tried or another medicine may be added to the first.Patients with more severe hypertension may initially begiven a combination of medicines to control their hyper-tension. Combining antihypertensive medicines with dif-ferent types of action often controls blood pressure withsmaller doses of each drug than would be needed formonotherapy.\nAntihypertensive medicines fall into several classes\nof drugs:\n•diuretics\n• beta-blockers\n•calcium channel blockers\n• angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibi-\ntors)\n• alpha-blockers• alpha-beta blockers•vasodilators\n• peripheral acting adrenergic antagonists\n• centrally acting agonists\nDiuretics help the kidneys eliminate excess salt and\nwater from the body’s tissues and the blood. This helpsreduce the swelling caused by fluid buildup in the tis-sues. The reduction of fluid dilates the walls of arteriesand lowers blood pressure.\nBeta-blockers lower blood pressure by acting on the\nnervous system to slow the heart rate and reduce theforce of the heart’s contraction. They are used with cau-tion in patients with heart failure ,asthma , diabetes, or\ncirculation problems in the hands and feet.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1722HypertensionCalcium channel blockers block the entry of calcium\ninto muscle cells in artery walls. Muscle cells need calci-um to constrict, so reducing their calcium keeps themmore relaxed and lowers blood pressure.\nACE inhibitors block the production of substances\nthat constrict blood vessels. They also help reduce thebuild-up of water and salt in the tissues. They are oftengiven to patients with heart failure, kidney disease, or dia-betes. ACE inhibitors may be used together with diuretics.\nAlpha-blockers act on the nervous system to dilate\narteries and reduce the force of the heart’s contractions.\nAlpha-beta blockers combine the actions of alpha\nand beta blockers .\nVasodilators act directly on arteries to relax their\nwalls so blood can move more easily through them. Theylower blood pressure rapidly and are injected in hyper-tensive emergencies when patients have dangerouslyhigh blood pressure.\nPeripheral acting adrenergic antagonists act on the\nnervous system to relax arteries and reduce the force of theheart’s contractions. They usually are prescribed togetherwith a diuretic. Peripheral acting adrenergic antagonistscan cause slowed mental function and lethargy.\nCentrally acting agonists also act on the nervous sys-\ntem to relax arteries and slow the heart rate. They areusually used with other antihypertensive medicines.\nPrognosis\nThere is no cure for hypertension. However, it can\nbe well controlled with the proper treatment. Therapywith a combination of lifestyle changes and antihyper-tensive medicines usually can keep blood pressure at lev-els that will not cause damage to the heart or otherorgans. The key to avoiding serious complications ofhypertension is to detect and treat it before damageoccurs. Because antihypertensive medicines controlblood pressure, but do not cure it, patients must continuetaking the medications to maintain reduced blood pres-sure levels and avoid complications.\nPrevention\nPrevention of hypertension centers on avoiding or\neliminating known risk factors. Even persons at riskbecause of age, race, or sex or those who have an inheritedrisk can lower their chance of developing hypertension.\nThe risk of developing hypertension can be reduced\nby making the same changes recommended for treatinghypertension:\n• reducing salt intakeKEY TERMS\nArteries —Blood vessels that carry blood to organs\nand other tissues of the body.\nArteriosclerosis —Hardening and thickening of\nartery walls.\nCushing’s syndrome —A disorder in which too\nmuch of the adrenal hormone, cortisol, is pro-duced; it may be caused by a pituitary or adrenalgland tumor.\nDiastolic blood pressure —Blood pressure when\nthe heart is resting between beats.\nHypertension —High blood pressure.\nRenal artery stenosis —Disorder in which the\narteries that supply blood to the kidneys constrict.\nSphygmomanometer —An instrument used to\nmeasure blood pressure.\nSystolic blood pressure —Blood pressure when the\nheart contracts (beats).\nVasodilator —Any drug that relaxes blood vessel\nwalls.\nVentricle —One of the two lower chambers of the\nheart.\n• reducing fat intake\n• losing weight\n• getting regular exercise\n• quitting smoking• reducing alcohol consumption• managing stress\nResources\nBOOKS\nBellenir, Karen, and Peter D.

    "title": "Hyperthyroidism",
    "content": "Hyperthyroidism\nDefinition\nHyperthyroidism is the overproduction of thyroid\nhormones by an overactive thyroid.\nDescription\nLocated in the front of the neck, the thyroid gland\nproduces the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyro-\nnine (T3) that regulate the body’s metabolic rate by help-\ning to form protein ribonucleic acid (RNA) and increas-ing oxygen absorption in every cell. In turn, the produc-tion of these hormones are controlled by thyroid-stimu-lating hormone (TSH) that is produced by the pituitarygland. When production of the thyroid hormones increas-es despite the level of TSH being produced, hyperthy-roidism occurs. The excessive amount of thyroid hor-mones in the blood increases the body’s metabolism, cre-ating both mental and physical symptoms.\nThe term hyperthyroidism covers any disease which\nresults in overabundance of thyroid hormone. Othernames for hyperthyroidism, or specific diseases withinthe category, include Graves’ disease, diffuse toxic goi-\nter, Basedow’s disease, Parry’s disease, and thyrotoxico-\nsis. The disease is 10 times more common in womenthan in men, and the annual incidence of hyperthy-roidism in the United States is about one per 1,000women. Although it occurs at all ages, hyperthyroidismis most likely to occur after the age of 15. There is a formof hyperthyroidism called Neonatal Grave’s disease,which occurs in infants born of mothers with Graves’ dis-ease. Occult hyperthyroidism may occur in patients over65 and is characterized by a distinct lack of typical symp-toms. Diffuse toxic goiter occurs in as many as 80% ofpatients with hyperthyroidism.\nCauses and symptoms\nHyperthyroidism is often associated with the body’s\nproduction of autoantibodies in the blood which causethe thyroid to grow and secrete excess thyroid hormone.This condition, as well as other forms of hyperthy-roidism, may be inherited. Regardless of the cause,hyperthyroidism produces the same symptoms, includingweight loss with increased appetite, shortness of breath\nand fatigue , intolerance to heat, heart palpitations ,\nincreased frequency of bowel movements, weak muscles,tremors ,anxiety , and difficulty sleeping. Women may\nalso notice decreased menstrual flow and irregular men-strual cycles.\nPatients with Graves’ disease often have a goiter\n(visible enlargement of the thyroid gland), although asmany as 10% do not. These patients may also havebulging eyes. Thyroid storm, a serious form of hyperthy-roidism, may show up as sudden and acute symptoms,some of which mimic typical hyperthyroidism, as well asthe addition of fever , substantial weakness, extreme rest-\nlessness, confusion, emotional swings or psychosis , and\nperhaps even coma .\nDiagnosis\nPhysicians will look for physical signs and symptoms\nindicated by patient history. On inspection, the physicianmay note symptoms such as a goiter or eye bulging. Othersymptoms or family history may be clues to a diagnosis ofhyperthyroidism. An elevated body temperature (basalbody temperature) above 98.6°F (37°C) may be an indica-tion of a heightened metabolic rate (basal metabolic rate)and hyperthyroidism. A simple blood test can be performedto determine the amount of thyroid hormone in thepatient’s blood. The diagnosis is usually straightforwardwith this combination of clinical history, physical exami-\nnation , and routine blood hormone tests. Radioimmunoas-\nsay, or a test to show concentrations of thyroid hormoneswith the use of a radioisotope mixed with fluid samples,helps confirm the diagnosis. A thyroid scan is a nuclearmedicine procedure involving injection of a radioisotopedye which will tag the thyroid and help produce a clearimage of inflammation or involvement of the entire thy-roid. Other tests can determine thyroid function and thy-roid-stimulating hormone levels. Ultrasonography, com-\nputed tomography scans (CT scan), and magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) may provide visual confirmation of\na diagnosis or help to determine the extent of involvement.\nTreatment\nTreatment will depend on the specific disease and\nindividual circumstances such as age, severity of disease,and other conditions affecting a patient’s health.\nAntithyroid drugs\nAntithyroid drugs are often administered to help the\npatient’s body cease overproduction of thyroid hor-mones. This medication may work for young adults,pregnant women, and others. Women who are pregnantshould be treated with the lowest dose required to main-tain thyroid function in order to minimize the risk ofhypothyroidism in the infant.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1724HyperthyroidismRadioactive iodine\nRadioactive iodine is often prescribed to damage\ncells that make thyroid hormone. The cells need iodine tomake the hormone, so they will absorb any iodine foundin the body. The patient may take an iodine capsule dailyfor several weeks, resulting in the eventual shrinkage ofthe thyroid in size, reduced hormone production and areturn to normal blood levels. Some patients may receivea single larger oral dose of radioactive iodine to treat thedisease more quickly. This should only be done forpatients who are not of reproductive age or are not plan-ning to have children, since a large amount can concen-trate in the reproductive organs (gonads).\nSurgery\nSome patients may undergo surgery to treat hyperthy-\nroidism. Most commonly, patients treated with thyroidec-\ntomy , in the form of partial or total removal of the thyroid,\nsuffer from large goiter and have suffered relapses, evenafter repeated attempts to address the disease through drugtherapy. Some patients may be candidates for surgerybecause they were not good candidates for iodine therapy,or refused iodine administration.

Caffeinated drinks and dairyproducts should be avoided. Under the supervision of atrained physician, high dosages of certain vitamin/miner-al combinations can help alleviate hyperthyroidism.\nPrognosis\nHyperthyroidism is generally treatable and carries a\ngood prognosis. Most patients lead normal lives withproper treatment. Thyroid storm, however, can be life-threatening and can lead to heart, liver, or kidney failure.\nPrevention\nThere are no known prevention methods for hyper-\nthyroidism, since its causes are either inherited or notcompletely understood. The best prevention tactic isknowledge of family history and close attention to symp-toms and signs of the disease. Careful attention to pre-scribed therapy can prevent complications of the disease.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Burton Goldberg Group. Alternative Medicine.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a form of car-diomyopathy in which the walls of the heart’s chambersthicken abnormally. Other names for hypertrophic car-diomyopathy are idiopathic hypertrophic subaorticstenosis and asymmetrical septal hypertrophy.\nDescription\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually appears in\nyoung people, often in athletes. For this reason it issometimes called athletic heart muscle disease. However,people of any age can develop hypertrophic cardiomy-opathy. Often there are no symptoms of hypertrophic car-diomyopathy. Sudden death can occur, caused by a heart\narrhythmia. The American Heart Association reports that36% of young athletes who die suddenly have probableor definite hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the result of abnor-\nmal growth of the heart muscle cells. The wall betweenthe heart’s chambers (the septum) may become so thick-ened that it blocks the flow of blood through the lowerleft chamber (left ventricle). The thickened wall maypush on the heart valve between the two left heart cham-bers (mitral valve), making it leaky. The thickened mus-cle walls also prevent the heart from stretching as muchas it should to fill with blood.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not\nknown. In about one-half of cases, the disease is inherit-ed. An abnormal gene has been identified in thesepatients. In cases that are not hereditary, a gene that wasnormal at birth may later become abnormal.Often people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nhave no symptoms. Unfortunately, the first sign of thecondition may be sudden death caused by an abnormalheart rhythm. When symptoms do appear, they includeshortness of breath on exertion, dizziness ,fainting ,\nfatigue , and chest pain .\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is based on the patient’s symptoms (if\nany), a complete physical examination , and tests that\ndetect abnormalities of the heart chambers. Usually,there is an abnormal heart murmur that worsens with theValsalva maneuver . The electrocardiogram (ECG),\nwhich provides a record of electrical changes in the heartmuscle during the heartbeat, also is typically abnormal.\nSometimes, a routine chest x ray may show that the\nheart is enlarged. Echocardiography , a procedure that\nproduces images of the heart’s structure, is usually done.These images can show if the heart wall is thickened andif there are any abnormalities of the heart valves.\nTreatment\nTreatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually\nconsists of taking medicines and restricting strenuousexercise . Drugs called beta blockers and calcium chan-\nnel blockers are usually prescribed. Beta blockers\nreduce the force of the heart’s contractions. Calciumchannel blockers can help improve the flexibility of theheart muscle walls, allowing them to stretch more.Antiarrhythmic drugs may also be given to prevent\nabnormal heart rhythms.\nPatients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are also\ntold to avoid strenuous exercise to reduce the risk ofpassing out or sudden death.\nIn some cases, if the medications do not help relieve\nsymptoms, surgery may help. In an operation calledmyotomy-myectomy a piece of the septum is removed toimprove blood flow through the heart chamber.\nSome patients have pacemakers and/or defibrilla-\ntors implanted to help control the heart rate and rhythm.Pacemakers and defibrillators provide electrical impulsesto the heart, which can return the heart beat to a normalrhythm.\nIf these treatment methods fail and a patient devel-\nops heart failure , a heart transplant may be necessary.\nPrognosis\nSome people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nmay not have obstructed blood flow and may never expe-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1726Hypertrophic cardiomyopathyrience symptoms. Others may only experience mild\nsymptoms. With treatment, symptoms may improve. Insome patients, the disease may progress to heart failure.\nPrevention\nWhile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cannot be pre-\nvented, precautionary measures may prevent suddendeaths. Anyone planning to take part in a program ofstrenuous competitive exercise should have a checkup bya physician first. A physical examination before athleticparticipation can usually, but not always, detect condi-tions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Anyone whoexperiences symptoms of shortness of breath, tiredness,or fainting with exercise should see a physician.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBellenir, Karen, and Peter D. Dresser, eds.

It is usually caused byblunt eye trauma.\nDescription\nThe anterior chamber (AC) is located behind the\nfront of the eye. The AC is filled with a fluid called aque-ous humor. This fluid helps form a cushion for the eyeand provides an important route for nutrient and wastetransport. Contusive forces from high velocity projectiles(approximately 34% of emergency room cases) such as arock, crab apples, ice balls, badminton birds, and bungeecords can tear local blood vessels in the eye.

Reproduced by permission.)seepage of blood into a visible layer portion of the AC,\ncausing the affected person to have red eye.\nCauses and symptoms\nHyphema is caused by blunt, projectile, or explosion\n(about 4% of cases) injuries. These injuries cause a localblood vessel in the eye to tear, filling the front portion ofthe AC with blood. The initial complaint is a dramaticdecrease in vision that eventually gets better as bloodseeps towards the back of the eye. Patients will haveextreme pain , an increase in intraocular pressure (the\npressure inside the eye), and nausea. Patients usually willshow a red eye and a recent history of trauma. Patients arevulnerable to more bleeding three to five days post injury.\nDiagnosis\nAll persons with hyphema must be examined by an\nophthalmologist (a physician who specializes in the med-ical and surgical care of the eye). Usually the clinician willuse an ophthalmoscope to visualize the internal structuresand damage. In some cases there may be small microscop-ic bleeds that may form clots (microhyphema) and requirespecialized instrumentation (a slit lamp) for visualization.\nTreatment\nBloodthinners, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs, should be avoided. In most cases theaffected person can be medically managed on an outpa-tient basis. The eye should be shielded, but not patched.The patient should be placed at bed rest with the head ele-vated 45°. This position allows blood to leave the ACallowing for better vision.

    "title": "Hypnotherapy",
    "content": "Hypnotherapy\nDefinition\nHypnotherapy is the treatment of a variety of health\nconditions by hypnotism or by inducing prolonged sleep.\nPioneers in this field, such as James Braid and James\nEsdaile discovered that hypnosis could be used to suc-cessfully anesthetize patients for surgeries. James Braidaccidentally discovered that one of his patients began toenter a hypnotic state while staring at a fixed light as hewaited for his eye examination to begin. Since mes-\nmerism had fallen out of favor, Braid coined the termhypnotism, which is derived from the Greek word forsleep. Braid also used the techniques of monotony,rhythm, and imitation to assist in inducing a hypnoticstate. As of 2000, these techniques are still in use.\nAround 1900, there were very few preoperative\nanesthetic drugs available. Patients were naturally appre-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1728Hypnotherapyhensive when facing surgery. One out of four hundred\npatients would die, not from the surgical procedure, butfrom the anesthesia. Dr. Henry Munro was one of thefirst physicians to use hypnotherapy to alleviate patientfears about having surgery. He would get his patients intoa hypnotic state and discuss their fears with them, tellingthem they would feel a lot better following surgery. Etherwas the most common anesthetic at that time, and Dr.Munro found that he was able to perform surgery usingonly about 10% of the usual amount of ether.\nPurpose\nHypnotherapy is used in a number of fields includ-\ning psychotherapy, surgery, dentistry, research, and med-icine. Hypnotherapy is commonly used as an alternativetreatment for a wide range of health conditions, includ-ing weight control, pain management , and smoking\ncessation. It is also used to control pain in a variety of\nconditions such as headache , facial neuralgia , arthritis,\nburns , musculoskeletal disorders, childbirth , and many\nmore. Hypnotherapy is being used in place of anesthesia,particularly in patients who prove to be allergic to anes-thetic drugs, for surgeries such as hysterectomies, cesare-an sections, certain cardiovascular procedures, thy-\nroidectomy , and others. Dentistry is using hypnotherapy\nwith success on patients who are allergic to all types ofnovocaine drugs. Hypnotherapy is also useful in helpingpatients overcome phobias .\nHypnotherapy is used for nonmedical patients as well\nas those who wish to overcome bad habits. Hypnotherapyhas been shown to help those who suffer from performanceanxiety , such as in sports, and speaking in public. In acade-\nmic applications, it has also been shown to help with learn-ing, participating in the classroom, concentrating, studying,focusing attention span, improving memory, and helpingremove mental blocks about particular subjects.\nIn more general areas, hypnotherapy has been found\nto be beneficial for problems such as motivation, pro-crastination, decision making, personal achievement anddevelopment, job performance, buried or repressed mem-ories, relaxation, and stress management.\nDescription\nOrigins\nHypnotherapy is thought to date back to the healing\npractices of ancient Greece and Egypt. Many religions suchas Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and others have attributedtrance-like behavior to spiritual or divine possession.\nAustrian physician, Franz Mesmer (1734–1815), is\ncredited with being the first person to scientificallyinvestigate the idea of hypnotherapy, in 1779, to treat a\nvariety of health conditions. Mesmer studied medicine atthe University of Vienna and received his medical degreein 1766. Mesmer is believed to have been the first doctorto understand the relationship of psychological trauma toillness. He induced a trance-like state, which becameknown as mesmerism, in his patients to successfully treatnervous disorders. These techniques became the founda-tion for modern-day hypnotherapy.\nMesmer’s original interest was in the effect of celes-\ntial bodies on human lives. He later became interested inthe effects of magnetism, and found that magnets couldhave tremendous healing effects on the human body.Mesmer believed that the human body contained a mag-netic fluid that promoted health and well being. It wasthought that any blockage to the normal flow of thismagnetic fluid would result in illness, and that the use ofthe mesmerism technique could restore the normal flow.\nMesmer performed his technique by passing his\nhands up and down the patient’s body. The techniquewas supposed to transmit magnetic fluid from his handsto the bodies of his patients. During this time period,there was no clear delineation between health conditionsthat were physical or psychological in nature. AlthoughMesmer did not realize it at that time, his treatmentswere most effective for those conditions that were pri-marily psychosomatic.\nMesmer’s technique appeared to be quite successful\nin the treatment of his patients, but he was the subject ofscorn and ridicule from the medical profession. Becauseof all the controversy surrounding mesmerism, andbecause Mesmer’s personality was quite eccentric, acommission was convened to investigate his techniquesand procedures. A very distinguished panel of investiga-tors included Benjamin Franklin, the French chemistAntoine-Laurent Lavoisier, and physician Jacques Guil-lotin. The commission acknowledged that patients didseem to obtain noticeable relief from their conditions, butthe whole idea was dismissed as being medical quackery.\nIt took more than two hundred years for hypnothera-\npy to become incorporated into medical treatment. In1955, the British Medical Association approved the useof hypnotherapy as a valid medical treatment, with theAmerican Medical Association (AMA) giving itsapproval in 1958.\nHypnotherapy involves achieving a psychological\nstate of awareness that is different from the ordinary stateof consciousness. While in a hypnotic state, a variety ofphenomena can occur. These phenomena include alter-ations in memory, heightened susceptibility to sugges-tion, paralysis , sweating, and blushing. All of these\nchanges can be produced or removed in the hypnotic\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1729Hypnotherapystate. Many studies have shown that roughly 90% of the\npopulation is capable of being hypnotized.\nThis state of awareness can be achieved by relaxing\nthe body, focusing on breathing, and shifting attentionaway from the external environment. In this state, thepatient has a heightened receptivity to suggestion. Theusual procedure for inducing a hypnotic trance in anotherperson is by direct command repeated in a soothing,monotonous tone of voice.\nPreparations\nIdeally, the following conditions should be present\nto successfully achieve a state of hypnosis:\n• willingness to be hypnotized• rapport between the patient or client and the hypnother-\napist\n• a comfortable environment that is conducive to relax-\nation\nPrecautions\nHypnotherapy can have negative outcomes. When\nused as entertainment, people have been hypnotized tosay or do things that would normally embarrass them.There have been instances where people already danger-ously close to psychological breakdown have beenpushed into an emotional crisis during what was sup-posed to be a harmless demonstration of hypnosis. Astatement from the World Hypnosis Organization(WHO) warns against performing hypnosis on patientssuffering from psychosis , organic psychiatric conditions,\nor antisocial personality disorders . Because there are\nno standard licensing requirements, in the wrong hands,there is a risk that the hypnotist will have difficulty incontrolling or ending a hypnotic state that has beeninduced in the patient.\nThere is a commonly held belief that a person can-\nnot be coerced into doing things that they would not nor-mally do while under hypnosis. The hynotherapist shouldtake care however, not to give suggestions during hypno-sis that are contrary to the patient’s moral code.\nMany religions do not condone the practice of hyp-\nnotherapy. Leaders of the Jehovah’s Witnesses and Chris-tian Science religions oppose the use of hypnotherapyand advise their members to avoid it completely, whetherfor entertainment or therapy. The Church of Jesus Christof Latter-Day Saints approves it for medical purposes,but cautions members against allowing themselves to behypnotized for entertainment or demonstration purposes.\nIn 1985, The AMA convened a commission that\nwarned against using hypnotherapy to aid in recollectionof events. The commission cited studies that showed the\npossibility of hypnotic recall resulting on confabulationor an artificial sense of certainty about the course ofevents. As a result, many states limit or prohibit testimo-ny of hypnotized witnesses or victims.\nSide effects\nExperiments have been conducted to determine any\nside effects of hypnotherapy. Some subjects have report-ed side effects such as headache, stiff neck, drowsiness,cognitive distortion or confusion, dizziness , and anxiety.\nHowever, most of these effects cleared up within severalhours of the hypnotherapy session.\nResearch and general acceptance\nResearch on the effectiveness of hypnotherapy on a\nvariety of medical conditions is extensive. In one study,the use of hypnotherapy did not seem to alter the coresymptoms in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperac-tivity disorder ( ADHD ); however, it did seem to be use-\nful in managing the associated symptoms including sleepdisturbances and tics.\nHypnotherapy is being studied in children who have\ncommon, chronic problems and to aid in relieving pain.Children are particularly good candidates for hypnotherapybecause their lack of worldly experience enables them tomove easily between the rational world and their imagina-tion. Studies with children have shown responses to hyp-notherapy ranging from diminished pain and anxiety dur-ing a number of medical procedures, a 50% range in reduc-tion of symptoms or a complete resolution of a medicalcondition, and a reduction in use of anti-nausea medicationand vomiting during chemotherapy for childhood cancers.\nThe use of hypnotherapy with cancer patients is\nanother area being investigated. A meta-analysis of 116studies showed very positive results of using hypnotherapywith cancer patients. Ninety-two percent showed a posi-tive effect on depression; 93% showed a positive effect onphysical well-being; 81% showed a positive effect onvomiting; and 92% showed a positive effect on pain.\nResources\nBOOKS\nElman, Dave.

    "title": "Hypocalcemia",
    "content": "Hypocalcemia\nDefinition\nHypocalcemia, a low bood calcium level, occurs\nwhen the concentration of free calcium ions in the bloodfalls below 4.0 mg/dL (dL=one tenth of a liter). The nor-mal concentration of free calcium ions in the bloodserum is 4.0–6.0 mg/dL.Description\nCalcium is an important mineral for maintaining\nhuman helath. It is not only a component of bones andteeth, but is also essential for normal blood clotting andnecessary for normal muscle and nerve functions. The cal-cium ion (Ca\n2+) has two positive charges. In bone, calcium\nions occur as a complex with phosphate to form crystals ofcalcium phosphate. In the bloodstream, calcium ions alsooccur in complexes, and here calcium is found combinedwith proteins and various nutrients. However, in the blood-stream, calcium also occurs in a free form. Normally,about 47% of the calcium in the blood plasma is free,while 53% occurs in a complexed form. Although all ofthe calcium in the bloodstream serves a useful purpose, itis only the concentration of free calcium ions which has adirect influence on the functioning of our nerves and mus-cles. For this reason, the measurement of the concentrationof free calcium is more important, in the diagnosis of dis-ease, than measuring the level of total calcium or of com-plexed calcium. The level of total calcium in the bloodserum is normally 8.5–10.5 mg/dL, while the level of freecalcium is normally 4–5 mg/dl.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypocalcemia can be caused by hypoparathy-\nroidism , by failure to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,\nby low levels of plasma magnesium, or by failure to getadequate amounts of calcium or vitamin D in the diet.Hypoparathyroidism involves the failure of the parathy-roid gland to make parathyroid hormone. Parathyroidhormone controls and maintains plasma calcium levels.The hormone exerts its effect on the kidneys, where ittriggers the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus,hypocalcemia can be independently caused by damage tothe parathyroid gland or to the kidneys. 1,25-Dihydrox-yvitamin D stimulates the uptake of calcium from thediet and the mobilization of calcium from the bone. Bonemobilization means the natural process by which thebody dissolves part of the bone in the skeleton in order tomaintain or raise the levels of plasma calcium ions.\nLow plasma magnesium levels (hypomagnesia) can\nresult in hypocalcemia. Hypomagnesemia can occur withalcoholism or with diseases characterized by an inability\nto properly absorb fat. Magnesium is required forparathyroid hormone to play its part in maintaining plas-ma calcium levels. For this reason, any disease thatresults in lowered plasma magnesium levels may alsocause hypocalcemia.\nHypocalcimia may also result from the consumption\nof toxic levels of phosphate. Phosphate is a constituent ofcertain enema formulas. An enema is a solution that isused to cleanse the intestines via a hose inserted into the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1731Hypocalcemiarectum. Cases of hypocalcemia have been documented\nwhere people swallowed enema formulas, or where anenema has been administered to an infant.\nSymptoms of severe hypocalcemia include numb-\nness or tingling around the mouth or in the feet andhands, as well as in muscle spasms in the face, feet, andhands. Hypocalcemia can also result in depression, mem-ory loss, or hallucinations . Severe hypocalcemia occurs\nwhen serum free calcium is under 3 mg/dL. Chronic andmoderate hypocalcemia can result in cataracts (damage\nto the eyes). In this case, the term “chronic” means last-ing one year or longer.\nDiagnosis\nHypocalcemia is diagnosed by acquiring a sample of\nblood serum and measuring the concentraton of free cal-cium using a calcium-sensitive electrode. Hypocalcemiahas several causes, and hence a full diagnosis requiresassessment of health of the parathyroid gland, kidneys,and of plasma magnesium concentration.\nTreatment\nThe method chosen for treatment depends on the\nexact cause and on the severity of the hypocalcemia.Severe hypocalcemia requires injection of calcium ions,usually in the form of calcium gluconate. Oral calciumsupplements are prescribed for long term treatment (non-emergency) of hypocalcemia. The oral supplements maytake the form of calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, cal-cium lactate, or calcium gluconate. Where hypocalcemiaresults from kidney failure, treatment includes injectionsof 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Oral vitamin D supplementscan increase gastrointestinal absorption of calcium. Wherehypocalcemia results from hypoparathyroidism, treatmentmay include oral calcium, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, orother drugs. Where low serum magnesium levels occur,concurrently with hypocalcemia, the magnesium deficien-cy must be corrected to effectively treat the hypocalcemia.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for correcting hypocalcemia is excel-\nlent. However, the eye damage that may result fromchronic hypocalcemia cannot be reversed.KEY TERMS\nPlasma —Plasma is blood with the cells removed.\nSerum —Serum is blood plasma with the blood\nclotting proteins removed.Prevention\nThe first, and most obvious, way to help prevent\nhypocalcemia is to ensure that adequate amounts of cal-cium and vitamin D are consumed each day, either in thediet or as supplements. The hypocalcemia that may occurwith damage to the parathyroid gland or to the kidneyscannot be prevented. Hypocalcemia resulting fromoveruse of enemas can be prevented by reducing enema\nusage. Hypocalcemia resulting from magnesium defi-ciency tends to occur in chronic alcoholics, and this typeof hypocalcemia can be prevented by reducing alcoholconsumption and increasing the intake of healthful food.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrody, Tom.

    "content": "Hypochondriasis\nDefinition\nHypochondriasis is a mental disorder characterized\nby excessive fear of or preoccupation with a serious ill-ness, despite medical testing and reassurance to the con-trary. It was formerly called hypochondriacal neurosis.\nDescription\nAlthough hypochondriasis is often considered a dis-\norder that primarily affects adults, it is now increasinglyrecognized in children and adolescents. In addition,hypochondriasis may develop in elderly people withoutprevious histories of health-related fears. The disorderaccounts for about 5% of psychiatric patients and isequally common in men and women.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of hypochondriasis are not precisely\nknown. Children may have physical symptoms that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1732Hypochondriasisresemble or mimic those of other family members. In\nadults, hypochondriasis may sometimes reflect a self-centered character structure or a wish to be taken care ofby others; it may also have been copied from a parent’sbehavior. In elderly people, hypochondriasis may beassociated with depression or grief. It may also involvebiologically based hypersensitivity to internal stimuli.\nMost hypochondriacs are worried about being physi-\ncally sick, although some express fear of insanity. Thesymptoms reported can range from general descriptionsof a specific illness to unusual complaints. In manyinstances the symptoms reflect intensified awareness ofordinary body functions, such as heartbeat, breathing, orstomach noises. It is important to understand that ahypochondriac’s symptoms are not “in the head” in thesense of being delusional. The symptoms are real, but thepatient misinterprets bodily functions and attributes themto a serious or even lethal cause.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is often complicated by the patient’s\ndetailed understanding of symptoms and medical termi-nology from previous contacts with doctors. If a newdoctor suspects hypochondriasis, he or she will usuallyorder a complete medical workup in order to rule outphysical disease.\nPsychological evaluation is also necessary to rule\nout other disorders that involve feelings of anxiety or\ncomplaints of physical illness. These disorders includedepression, panic disorder , and schizophrenia with\nsomatic (physical) delusions . The following features are\ncharacteristic of hypochondriasis:\n• The patient is not psychotic (out of touch with reality or\nhallucinating).\n• The patient gets upset or blames the doctor when told\nthere is “nothing wrong,” or that there is a psychologi-cal basis for the problem.\n• There is a correlation between episodes of hypochondri-\nacal behavior and stressful periods in the patient’s life.\n• The behavior has lasted at least six months.\nEvaluation of children and adolescents with hypo-\nchondriasis should include the possibility of abuse by\nfamily members.\nTreatment\nThe goal of therapy is to help the patient (and fami-\nly) live with the symptoms and to modify thinking andbehavior that reinforces hypochondriacal symptoms.This treatment orientation is called supportive, as distinctfrom insight-oriented, because hypochondriacs usuallyKEY TERMS\nSomatoform disorder —A category of psychiatric\ndisorder characterized by conversion of emotionaldistress into physical symptoms or by symptoms ofphysical illness that have no discernible organiccause.

Some clinicians look carefully for “masked”depression and treat with antidepressants.\nFollow-up care includes regular physical checkups,\nbecause about 30% of patients with hypochondriasis willeventually develop a serious physical illness.

    "title": "Hypoglycemia",
    "content": "Hypoglycemia\nDefinition\nThe condition called hypoglycemia is literally trans-\nlated as low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia occurs whenblood sugar (or blood glucose) concentrations fall belowa level necessary to properly support the body’s need forenergy and stability throughout its cells.\nDescription\nCarbohydrates are the main dietary source of the\nglucose that is manufactured in the liver and absorbedinto the bloodstream to fuel the body’s cells and organs.Glucose concentration is controlled by hormones, pri-marily insulin and glucagon. Glucose concentration isalso controlled by epinephrine (adrenalin) and norepi-nephrine, as well as growth hormone. If these regulatorsare not working properly, levels of blood sugar canbecome either excessive (as in hyperglycemia) or inade-quate (as in hypoglycemia). If a person has a blood sugarlevel of 50 mg/dl or less, he or she is considered hypo-glycemic, although glucose levels vary widely from oneperson to another.\nHypoglycemia can occur in several ways.\nDrug-induced hypoglycemia\nDrug-induced hypoglycemia, a complication of dia-\nbetes, is the most commonly seen and most dangerousform of hypoglycemia.\nHypoglycemia occurs most often in diabetics who\nmust inject insulin periodically to lower their bloodsugar. While other diabetics are also vulnerable to lowblood sugar episodes, they have a lower risk of a seriousoutcome than do insulin-dependant diabetics. Unless rec-ognized and treated immediately, severe hypoglycemiain the insulin-dependent diabetic can lead to generalizedconvulsions followed by amnesia and unconsciousness.\nDeath , though rare, is a possible outcome.\nIn insulin-dependent diabetics, hypoglycemia\nknown as an insulin reaction or insulin shock can be\ncaused by several factors. These include overmedicatingwith manufactured insulin, missing or delaying a meal,eating too little food for the amount of insulin taken,exercising too strenuously, drinking too much alcohol, orany combination of these factors.Ideopathic or reactive hypoglycemia\nIdeopathic or reactive hypoglycemia (also called\npostprandial hypoglycemia) occurs when some peopleeat. A number of reasons for this reaction have been pro-posed, but no single cause has been identified.\nIn some cases, this form of hypoglycemia appears to\nbe associated with malfunctions or diseases of the liver,pituitary, adrenals, liver, or pancreas. These conditionsare unrelated to diabetes. Children intolerant of a naturalsugar (fructose) or who have inherited defects that affectdigestion may also experience hypoglycemic attacks.Some children with a negative reaction to aspirin also\nexperience reactive hypoglycemia. It sometimes occursamong people with an intolerance to the sugar found inmilk (galactose), and it also often begins before diabetesstrikes later on.\nFasting hypoglycemia\nFasting hypoglycemia sometimes occurs after long\nperiods without food, but it also happens occasionallyfollowing strenuous exercise , such as running in a\nmarathon.\nOther factors sometimes associated with hypogly-\ncemia include:\n• pregnancy\n• a weakened immune system\n• a poor diet high in simple carbohydrates\n• prolonged use of drugs, including antibiotics\n• chronic physical or mental stress\n• heartbeat irregularities (arrhythmias)\n•allergies\n• breast cancer\n• high blood pressure treated with beta-blocker medica-\ntions (after strenuous exercise)\n• upper gastrointestinal tract surgery\nCauses and symptoms\nWhen carbohydrates are eaten, they are converted to\nglucose that goes into the bloodstream and is distributedthroughout the body. Simultaneously, a combination ofchemicals that regulate how our body’s cells absorb thatsugar is released from the liver, pancreas, and adrenalglands. These chemical regulators include insulin,glucagon, epinephrine (adrenalin), and norepinephrine.The mixture of these regulators released following diges-tion of carbohydrates is never the same, since the amountof carbohydrates that are eaten is never the same.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1734HypoglycemiaInteractions among the regulators are complicated.\nAny abnormalities in the effectiveness of any one of theregulators can reduce or increase the body’s absorptionof glucose. Gastrointestinal enzymes such as amylaseand lactase that break down carbohydrates may not befunctioning properly. These abnormalities may producehyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, and can be detectedwhen the level of glucose in the blood is measured.\nCell sensitivity to these regulators can be changed in\nmany ways. Over time, a person’s stress level, exercisepatterns, advancing age, and dietary habits influence cel-lular sensitivity. For example, a diet consistently overlyrich in carbohydrates increases insulin requirements overtime. Eventually, cells can become less receptive to theeffects of the regulating chemicals, which can lead toglucose intolerance.\nDiet is both a major factor in producing hypo-\nglycemia as well as the primary method for controlling it.Diets typical of western cultures contain excess carbohy-\ndrates, especially in the form of simple carbohydrates suchas sweeteners, which are more easily converted to sugar.In poorer parts of the world, the typical diet contains evenhigher levels of carbohydrates. Fewer dairy products andmeats are eaten, and grains, vegetables, and fruits are con-sumed. This dietary trend is balanced, however, since peo-ple in these cultures eat smaller meals and usually use car-bohydrates more efficiently through physical labor.\nEarly symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, particular-\nly in the drug-induced type of hypoglycemia, resemblean extreme shock reaction. Symptoms include:\n• cold and pale skin• numbness around the mouth\n• apprehension\n• heart palpitations\n• emotional outbursts• hand tremors\n• mental cloudiness\n• dilated pupils• sweating\n• fainting\nMild attacks, however, are more common in reactive\nhypoglycemia and are characterized by extreme tired-ness. Patients first lose their alertness, then their musclestrength and coordination. Thinking grows fuzzy, andfinally the patient becomes so tired that he or shebecomes “zombie-like,” awake but not functioning.Sometimes the patient will actually fall asleep.Unplanned naps are typical of the chronic hypoglycemicpatient, particularly following meals.Additional symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia\ninclude headaches, double vision, staggering or inabilityto walk, a craving for salt and/or sweets, abdominal dis-tress, premenstrual tension, chronic colitis, allergies,ringing in the ears, unusual patterns in the frequency ofurination, skin eruptions and inflammations, pain in the\nneck and shoulder muscles, memory problems, and sud-den and excessive sweating.\nUnfortunately, a number of these symptoms mimic\nthose of other conditions. For example, the depression,insomnia , irritability, lack of concentration, crying spells,\nphobias , forgetfulness, confusion, unsocial behavior, and\nsuicidal tendencies commonly seen in nervous system andpsychiatric disorders may also be hypoglycemic symp-toms. It is very important that anyone with symptoms thatmay suggest reactive hypoglycemia see a doctor.\nBecause all of its possible symptoms are not likely to\nbe seen in any one person at a specific time, diagnosinghypoglycemia can be difficult. One or more of its manysymptoms may be due to another illness. Symptoms maypersist in a variety of forms for long periods of time.Symptoms can also change over time within the sameperson. Some of the factors that can influence symptomsinclude physical or mental activities, physical or mentalstate, the amount of time passed since the last meal, theamount and quality of sleep, and exercise patterns.\nDiagnosis\nDrug-induced hypoglycemia\nOnce diabetes is diagnosed, the patient then moni-\ntors his or her blood sugar level with a portable machinecalled a glucometer. The diabetic places a small bloodsample on a test strip that the machine can read. If thetest reveals that the blood sugar level is too low, the dia-betic can make a correction by eating or drinking anadditional carbohydrate.\nReactive hypoglycemia\nReactive hypoglycemia can only be diagnosed by a\ndoctor. Symptoms usually improve after the patient hasgone on an appropriate diet. Reactive hypoglycemia wasdiagnosed more frequently 10–20 years ago than today.Studies have shown that most people suffering from itssymptoms test normal for blood sugar, leading many doc-tors to suggest that actual cases of reactive hypoglycemiaare quite rare. Some doctors think that people with hypo-glycemic symptoms may be particularly sensitive to thebody’s normal postmeal release of the hormone epineph-rine, or are actually suffering from some other physical ormental problem. Others doctors believe reactive hypo-glycemia is actually the early onset of diabetes that occurs\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1735Hypoglycemiaafter a number of years. There continues to be disagree-\nment about the cause of reactive hypoglycemia.\nA common test to diagnose hypoglycemia is the\nextended oral glucose tolerance test. Following anovernight fast, a concentrated solution of glucose isdrunk and blood samples are taken hourly for five to sixhours. Though this test remains helpful in early identifi-cation of diabetes, its use in diagnosing chronic reactivehypoglycemia has lost favor because it can trigger hypo-glycemic symptoms in people with otherwise normalglucose readings. Some doctors now recommend thatblood sugar be tested at the actual time a person experi-ences hypoglycemic symptoms.\nTreatment\nTreatment of the immediate symptoms of hypo-\nglycemia can include eating sugar. For example, apatient can eat a piece of candy, drink milk, or drinkfruit juice. Glucose tablets can be used by patients,especially those who are diabetic. Effective treatmentof hypoglycemia over time requires the patient to fol-low a modified diet. Patients are usually encouraged toeat small, but frequent, meals throughout the day,avoiding excess simple sugars (including alcohol), fats,and fruit drinks. Those patients with severe hypo-glycemia may require fast-acting glucagon injectionsthat can stabilize their blood sugar within approximate-ly 15 minutes.KEY TERMS\nAdrenal glands —Two organs that sit atop the kid-\nneys; these glands make and release hormonessuch as epinephrine.\nEpinephrine —Also called adrenalin, a secretion of\nthe adrenal glands (along with norepinephrine)that helps the liver release glucose and limits therelease of insulin. Norepinephrine is both a hor-mone and a neurotransmitter, a substance thattransmits nerve signals.\nFructose —A type of natural sugar found in many\nfruits, vegetables, and in honey.\nGlucagon —A hormone produced in the pan-\ncreas that raises the level of glucose in the blood.An injectable form of glucagon, which can bebought in a drug store, is sometimes used to treatinsulin shock.\nPostprandial —After eating or after a meal.Alternative treatment\nA holistic approach to reactive hypoglycemia is\nbased on the belief that a number of factors may createthe condition. Among them are heredity, the effects ofother illnesses, emotional stress, too much or too littleexercise, bad lighting, poor diet, and environmental pol-lution. Therefore, a number of alternative methods havebeen proposed as useful in treating the condition. Home-\nopathy ,acupuncture , and applied kinesiology , for\nexample, have been used, as have herbal remedies. Oneof the herbal remedies commonly suggested for hypo-glycemia is a decoction (an extract made by boiling) ofgentian ( Gentiana lutea ). It should be drunk warm 15–30\nminutes before a meal. Gentian is believed to help stimu-late the endocrine (hormone-producing) glands.\nIn addition to the dietary modifications recommend-\ned above, people with hypoglycemia may benefit fromsupplementing their diet with chromium, which isbelieved to help improve blood sugar levels. Chromium isfound in whole grain breads and cereals, cheese,molasses, lean meats, and brewer’s yeast. Hypoglycemicsshould avoid alcohol, caffeine , and cigarette smoke, since\nthese substances can cause significant swings in bloodsugar levels.\nPrevention\nDrug-induced hypoglycemia\nPreventing hypoglycemic insulin reactions in diabet-\nics requires taking glucose readings through frequentblood sampling. Insulin can then be regulated based onthose readings. Maintaining proper diet is also a factor.Programmable insulin pumps implanted under the skinhave proven useful in reducing the incidence of hypo-glycemic episodes for insulin-dependent diabetics. As oflate 1997, clinical studies continue to seek additionalways to control diabetes and drug-induced hypoglycemia.Tests of a substance called pramlintide indicate that itmay help improve glycemic control in diabetics.\nReactive hypoglycemia\nThe onset of reactive hypoglycemia can be avoided\nor at least delayed by following the same kind of dietused to control it. While not as restrictive as the diet dia-betics must follow to keep tight control over their dis-ease, it is quite similar.\nThere are a variety of diet recommendations for the\nreactive hypoglycemic. Patients should:\n• avoid overeating• never skip breakfast\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1736Hypoglycemia• include protein in all meals and snacks, preferably from\nsources low in fat, such as the white meat of chicken orturkey, most fish, soy products, or skim milk\n• restrict intake of fats (particularly saturated fats, such as\nanimal fats), and avoid refined sugars and processedfoods\n• be aware of the differences between some vegetables,\nsuch as potatoes and carrots. These vegetables have ahigher sugar content than others (like squash and broc-coli). Patients should be aware of these differences andnote any reactions they have to them.\n• be aware of differences found in grain products. White\nflour is a carbohydrate that is rapidly absorbed into thebloodstream, while oats take much longer to breakdown in the body.\n• keep a “food diary.” Until the diet is stabilized, a patient\nshould note what and how much he/she eats and drinksat every meal. If symptoms appear following a meal orsnack, patients should note them and look for patterns.\n• eat fresh fruits, but restrict the amount they eat at one\ntime. Patients should remember to eat a source of pro-tein whenever they eat high sources of carbohydratelike fruit. Apples make particularly good snacksbecause, of all fruits, the carbohydrate in apples isdigested most slowly.\n• follow a diet that is high in fiber. Fruit is a good source\nof fiber, as is oatmeal and oat bran, which slows thebuildup of sugar in the blood during digestion.\nA doctor can recommend a proper diet, and there are\nmany cookbooks available for diabetics. Recipes foundin such books are equally effective in helping to controlhypoglycemia.\nPrognosis\nLike diabetes, there is no cure for reactive hypo-\nglycemia, only ways to control it. While some chroniccases will continue through life (rarely is there completeremission of the condition), others will develop into typeII (age onset) diabetes. Hypoglycemia appears to have ahigher-than-average incidence in families where therehas been a history of hypoglycemia or diabetes amongtheir members, but whether hypoglycemia is a control-lable warning of oncoming diabetes has not yet beendetermined by clinical research.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEades, Michael R., and Mary Dan.

    "title": "Hypogonadism",
    "content": "Hypogonadism\nDefinition\nHypogonadism is the condition more prevalent in\nmales in which the production of sex hormones and germcells are inadequate.\nDescription\nGonads are the organs of sexual differentiation—in\nthe female, they are ovaries; in the male, the testes.Along with producing eggs and sperm, they produce sexhormones that generate all the differences between menand women. If they produce too little sex hormone, theneither the growth of the sexual organs or their function isimpaired.\nThe gonads are not independent in their function,\nhowever. They are closely controlled by the pituitarygland. The pituitary hormones are the same for malesand females, but the gonadal hormones are different.Men produce mostly androgens, and women producemostly estrogens. These two hormones regulate thedevelopment of the embryo, determining whether it is amale or a female. They also direct the adolescent matura-tion of sex organs into their adult form. Further, they sus-tain those organs and their function throughout the repro-ductive years. The effects of estrogen reach beyond thatto sustain bone strength and protect the cardiovascularsystem from degenerative disease.\nHormones can be inadequate during or after each\nstage of development—embryonic and adolescent. Dur-ing each stage, inadequate hormone stimulation will pre-vent normal development. After each stage, a decrease inhormone stimulation will result in failed function andperhaps some shrinkage. The organs affected principallyby sex hormones are the male and female genitals, bothinternal and external, and the female breasts. Body hair,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1737HypogonadismKEY TERMS\nBiopsy —Surgical removal of pieces of tissue for\nexamination.\nEmbryo —Refers to life before birth, specifically\nthe first two months after conception.\nFetus —The unborn person or animal, still in the\nwomb.\nHypothalamus —Part of the brain just above the\npituitary that stimulates pituitary gland function.\nIonizing radiation —X rays. Diagnostic x rays are\ntoo weak to do damage under normal circum-stances, but x rays used to treat cancer must beused with great care.\nUndescended testicle —A testicle that is still in the\ngroin and has not made its way into the scrotum.fat deposition, bone and muscle growth, and some brain\nfunctions are also influenced.\nCauses and symptoms\nSex is determined at the moment of conception by\nsex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes,while males have one X and one Y chromosome. If themale sperm with the Y chromosome fertilizes an egg,the baby will be male. This is true throughout the ani-mal kingdom. Genetic defects sometimes result inchanges in the chromosomes. If sex chromosomes areinvolved, there is a change in the development of sexualcharacteristics.\nFemale is the default sex of the embryo, so most of\nthe sex organ deficits at birth occur in boys. Some, butnot all, are due to inadequate androgen stimulation. Thepenis may be small, the testicles undescended (cryp-torchidism) or various degrees of “feminization” of thegenitals may be present.\nAfter birth, sexual development does not occur until\npuberty . Hypogonadism most often shows up as an\nabnormality in boys during puberty. Again, not everydefect is due to inadequate hormones. Some are due totoo much of the wrong ones. Kallmann’s syndrome is abirth defect in the brain that prevents release of hor-mones and appears as failure of male puberty. Someboys have adequate amounts of androgen in their systembut fail to respond to them, a condition known as andro-gen resistance.\nFemale problems in puberty are not caused by too\nlittle estrogen. Even female reproductive problems arerarely related to a simple lack of hormones, but rather tocomplex cycling rhythms gone wrong. All the problemswith too little hormone happen during menopause ,\nwhich is a normal hypogonadism.\nA number of adverse events can damage the gonads\nand result in decreased hormone levels. The childhooddisease mumps , if acquired after puberty, can infect and\ndestroy the testicles—a disease called viral orchitis .\nIonizing radiation and chemotherapy , trauma, several\ndrugs (spironolactone, a diuretic and ketoconazole, anantifungal agent), alcohol, marijuana, heroin,methadone , and environmental toxins can all damage\ntesticles and decrease their hormone production. Severediseases in the liver or kidneys, certain infections, sicklecell anemia, and some cancers also affect gonads. Totreat some male cancers, it is necessary to remove thetesticles, thereby preventing the androgens from stimu-lating cancer growth. This procedure, still called castra-\ntion or orchiectomy , removes androgen stimulation from\nthe whole body.For several reasons the pituitary can fail. It happens\nrarely after pregnancy . It used to be removed to treat\nadvanced breast or prostate cancer . Sometimes the pitu-\nitary develops a tumor that destroys it. Failure of thepituitary is called hypopituitarism and, of course, leaves\nthe gonads with no stimulation to produce hormones.\nBesides the tissue changes generated by hormone\nstimulation, the only other symptoms relate to sexualdesire and function. Libido is enhanced by testosterone,and male sexual performance requires androgens. Therole of female hormones in female sexual activity is lessclear, although hormones strengthen tissues and promotehealthy secretions, facilitating sexual activity.\nDiagnosis\nPresently, there are accurate blood tests for most of\nthe hormones in the body, including those from the pitu-itary and even some from the hypothalamus. Chromo-somes can be analyzed, and gonads can, but rarely are,biopsied.\nTreatment\nReplacement of missing body chemicals is much\neasier than suppressing excesses. Estrogen replacementis recommended for nearly all women after menopausefor its many beneficial effects. Estrogen can be taken bymouth, injection, or skin patch. It is strongly recom-mended that the other female hormone, progesterone, betaken as well, because it prevents overgrowth of uterinelining and uterine cancer. Testosterone replacement isavailable for males who are deficient.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1738HypogonadismResources\nBOOKS\nCarr, Bruce R., and Karen D.

    "title": "Hypokalemia",
    "content": "Hypokalemia\nDefinition\nHypokalemia is a condition of below normal levels\nof potassium in the blood serum. Potassium, a necessaryelectrolyte, facilitates nerve impulse conduction and thecontraction of skeletal and smooth muscles, includingthe heart. It also facilitates cell membrane function andproper enzyme activity. Levels must be kept in a proper(homeostatic) balance for the maintenance of health. Thenormal concentration of potassium in the serum is in therange of 3.5–5.0 mM. Hypokalemia means serum orplasma levels of potassium ions that fall below 3.5 mM.(Potassium concentrations are often expressed in units ofmilliequivalents per liter [mEq/L], rather than in units ofmillimolarity [mM], however, both units are identicaland mean the same thing when applied to concentrationsof potassium ions.)\nHypokalemia can result from two general causes:\neither from an overall depletion in the body’s potassiumor from excessive uptake of potassium by muscle fromsurrounding fluids.\nDescription\nA normal adult weighing about 154 lbs (70 kg) has\nabout 3.6 moles of potassium ions in his body. Most ofthis potassium (about 98%) occurs inside various cellsand organs, where normal concentration are about 150mM. Blood serum concentrations are much lower—onlyabout 0.4% of the body’s potassium is found in bloodserum. As noted above, hypokalemia can be caused bythe sudden uptake of potassium ions from the blood-stream by muscle or other organs or by an overall deple-tion of the body’s potassium. Hypokalemia due to overalldepletion tends to be a chronic phenomenon, whilehypokalemia due to a shift in location tends to be a tem-porary disorder.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypokalemia is most commonly caused by the use\nof diuretics . Diuretics are drugs that increase the excre-\ntion of water and salts in the urine. Diuretics are used totreat a number of medical conditions, including hyper-\ntension (high blood pressure), congestive heart failure ,\nliver disease, and kidney disease. However, diuretic treat-ment can have the side effect of producing hypokalemia.In fact, the most common cause of hypokalemia in theelderly is the use of diuretics. The use of furosemide andthiazide, two commonly used diuretic drugs, can lead tohypokalemia. In contrast, spironolactone and triamtereneare diuretics that do not provoke hypokalemia.\nOther commons causes of hypokalemia are exces-\nsive diarrhea or vomiting. Diarrhea and vomiting can be\nproduced by infections of the gastrointestinal tract. Dueto a variety of organisms, including bacteria, protozoa,and viruses, diarrhea is a major world health problem. Itis responsible for about a quarter of the 10 million infantdeaths that occur each year. Although nearly all of thesedeaths occur in the poorer parts of Asia and Africa, diar-rheal diseases are a leading cause of infant death in the\nUnited States. Diarrhea results in various abnormalities,such as dehydration (loss in body water), hyponatrem-\nia(low sodium level in the blood), and hypokalemia.\nBecause of the need for potassium to control muscle\naction, hypokalemia can cause the heart to stop beating.Young infants are especially at risk for death from thiscause, especially where severe diarrhea continues for twoweeks or longer. Diarrhea due to laxative abuse is an occa-sional cause of hypokalemia in the adolescent or adult.Enema abuse is a related cause of hypokalemia. Laxativeabuse is especially difficult to diagnose and treat, becausepatients usually deny the practice. Up to 20% of persons\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1739Hypokalemiacomplaining of chronic diarrhea practice laxative abuse.\nLaxative abuse is often part of eating disorders, such asanorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa . Hypokalemia that\noccurs with these eating disorders may be life-threatening.\nSurprisingly, the potassium loss that accompanies\nvomiting is only partly due to loss of potassium from thevomit. V omiting also has the effect of provoking anincrease in potassium loss in the urine. V omiting expelsacid from the mouth, and this loss of acid results in alka-lization of the blood. (Alkalization of the blood meansthat the pH of the blood increases slightly.) An increasedblood pH has a direct effect on the kidneys. Alkalineblood provokes the kidneys to release excessive amountsof potassium in the urine. So, severe and continual vom-iting can cause excessive losses of potassium from thebody and hypokalemia.\nA third general cause of hypokalemia is prolonged\nfasting and starvation . In most people, after three weeks\nof fasting, blood serum potassium levels will decline tobelow 3.0 mM and result in severe hypokalemia. Howev-er, in some persons, serum potassium may be naturallymaintained at about 3.0 mM, even after 100 days of fast-ing. During fasting, muscle is naturally broken down, andthe muscle protein is converted to sugar (glucose) to sup-ply to the brain the glucose which is essential for its func-tioning. Other organs are able to survive with a mixedsupply of fat and glucose. The potassium within the mus-cle cell is released during the gradual process of musclebreakdown that occurs with starvation, and this can helpcounteract the trend to hypokalemia during starvation.Eating an unbalanced diet does not cause hypokalemiabecause most foods, such as fruits (especially bananas,oranges, and melons), vegetables, meat, milk, and cheese,are good sources of potassium. Only foods such as butter,margarine, vegetable oil, soda water, jelly beans, and hardcandies are extremely poor in potassium.\nAlcoholism occasionally results in hypokalemia.\nAbout one half of alcoholics hospitalized for withdrawalsymptoms experience hypokalemia. The hypokalemia ofalcoholics occurs for a variety of reasons, usually poornutrition , vomiting, and diarrhea. Hypokalemia can also\nbe caused by hyperaldosteronism ; Cushing’s syn-\ndrome ; hereditary kidney defects such as Liddle’s syn-\ndrome, Bartter’s syndrom, and Franconi’s syndrome; andeating too much licorice.\nSymptoms\nMild hypokalemia usually results in no symptoms,\nwhile moderate hypokalemia results in confusion, disori-entation, weakness, and discomfort of muscles. On occa-sion, moderate hypokalemia causes cramps during exer-\ncise. Another symptom of moderate hypokalemia is adiscomfort in the legs that is experienced while sitting\nstill. The patient may experience an annoying feeling thatcan be relieved by shifting the positions of the legs or bystomping the feet on the floor. Severe hypokalemiaresults in extreme weakness of the body and, on occa-sion, in paralysis . The paralysis that occurs is “flaccid\nparalysis,” or limpness. Paralysis of the muscles of thelungs results in death. Another dangerous result of severehypokalemia is abnormal heart beat (arrhythmia) that canlead to death from cardiac arrest (cessation of heart beat).Moderate hypokalemia may be defined as serum potassi-um between 2.5 and 3.0 mM, while severe hypokalemiais defined as serum potassium under 2.5 mM.\nDiagnosis\nHypokalemia can be measured by acquiring a sample\nof blood, preparing blood serum, and using a potassiumsensitive electrode for measuring the concentration ofpotassium ions. Atomic absorption spectroscopy can alsobe used to measure the potassium ions. Since hypokalemiaresults in abnormalities in heart behavior, the electrocar-diogram is usually used in the diagnosis of hypokalemia.The diagnosis of the cause of hypokalemia can be helpedby measuring the potassium content of the urine. Whereurinary potassium is under 25 mmoles per day, it meansthat the patient has experienced excessive losses of potas-sium due to diarrhea. The urinary potassium test is usefulin cases where the patient is denying the practice of laxa-tive or enema abuse. In contrast, where hypokalemia isdue to the use of diuretic drugs, the content of potassiumin the urine will be high—over 40 mmoles per day.\nTreatment\nIn emergency situations, when severe hypokalemia is\nsuspected, the patient should be put on a cardiac monitor,and respiratory status should be assessed. If laboratorytest results show potassium levels below 2.5 mM, intra-venous potassium should be given. In less urgent cases,potassium can be given orally in the pill form. Potassiumsupplements take the form of pills containing potassiumchloride (KCl), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO\n3), and\npotassium acetate. Oral potassium chloride is the safestand most effective treatment for hypokalemia. Generally,the consumption of 40–80 mmoles of KCl per day is suf-ficient to correct the hypokalemia that results from diuret-ic therapy. For many people taking diuretics, potassiumsupplements are not necessary as long as they eat a bal-anced diet containing foods rich in potassium.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for correcting hypokalemia is excel-\nlent. However, in emergency situations, where potassium\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1740Hypokalemiais administered intravenously, the physician must be\ncareful not to give too much potassium. The administra-tion of potassium at high levels, or at a high rate, can leadto abnormally high levels of serum potassium.\nPrevention\nHypokalemia is not a concern for healthy persons,\nsince potassium is present in a great variety of foods. Forpatients taking diuretics, however, the American DieteticAssociation recommends use of a high potassium diet.The American Dietetic Association states that ifhypokalemia has already occurred, use of the high potas-sium diet alone may not reverse hypokalemia. Usefulcomponents of a high potassium diet include bananas,tomatoes, cantaloupes, figs, raisins, kidney beans, pota-toes, and milk.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Dietetic Association.

Blood absorbs fat from food in the intestineand transports it as a combined package with proteins andother chemicals like cholesterol. Much of the fat goesstraight into the liver for processing.

    "title": "Hyponatremia",
    "content": "Hyponatremia\nDefinition\nThe normal concentration of sodium in the blood\nplasma is 136–145 mM. Hyponatremia occurs whensodium falls below 130 mM. Plasma sodium levels of125 mM or less are dangerous and can result in seizuresand coma .\nDescription\nSodium is an atom, or ion, that carries a single posi-\ntive charge. The sodium ion may be abbreviated as Na+or\nas simply Na. Sodium can occur as a salt in a crystallinesolid. Sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium phosphate(Na\n2HPO4) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) are com-\nmonly occurring salts. These salts can be dissolved inwater or in juices of various foods. Dissolving involvesthe complete separation of ions, such as sodium andchloride in common table salt (NaCl).\nAbout 40% of the body’s sodium is contained in\nbone. Approximately 2–5% occurs within organs andcells and the remaining 55% is in blood plasma and otherKEY TERMS\nCholesterol —A steroid alcohol found in animal\ncells and fluids.\nLipoprotein —Class of proteins that contain pro-\ntein and lipid. The fundamental component of liv-ing cells.extracellular fluids. The amount of sodium in blood plas-\nma is typically 140 mM, a much higher amount than isfound in intracellular sodium (about 5 mM). This asym-metric distribution of sodium ions is essential for humanlife. It makes possible proper nerve conduction, the pas-sage of various nutrients into cells, and the maintenanceof blood pressure.\nThe body continually regulates its handling of sodi-\num. When dietary sodium is too high or low, theintestines and kidneys respond to adjust concentrationsto normal. During the course of a day, the intestinesabsorb dietary sodium while the kidneys excrete a nearlyequal amount of sodium into the urine. If a low sodiumdiet is consumed, the intestines increase their efficiencyof sodium absorption, and the kidneys reduce its releaseinto urine.\nThe concentration of sodium in the blood plasma\ndepends on two things: the total amount of sodium andwater in arteries, veins, and capillaries (the circulatory sys-tem). The body uses separate mechanisms to regulate sodi-um and water, but they work together to correct bloodpressure when it is too high or too low. Too low a concen-tration of sodium, or hyponatremia, can be corrected eitherby increasing sodium or by decreasing body water. Theexistence of separate mechanisms that regulate sodiumconcentration account for the fact that there are numerousdiseases that can cause hyponatremia, including diseasesof the kidney, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus.\nCauses and symptoms\nHyponatremia can be caused by abnormal consump-\ntion or excretion of dietary sodium or water and by dis-eases that impair the body’s ability to regulate them.Maintenance of a low salt diet for many months or exces-sive sweat loss during a race on a hot day can present achallenge to the body to conserve adequate sodium lev-els. While these conditions alone are not likely to causehyponatremia, it can occur under special circumstances.For example, hyponatremia often occurs in patients tak-ing diuretic drugs who maintain a low sodium diet. Thisis especially of concern in elderly patients, who have areduced ability to regulate the concentrations of variousnutrients in the bloodstream. Diuretic drugs that fre-quently cause hyponatremia include furosemide (Lasix),bumetanide (Bumex), and most commonly, the thiazides.Diuretics enhance the excretion of sodium into the urine,\nwith the goal of correcting high blood pressure. Howev-er, too much sodium excretion can result in hyponatrem-ia. Usually only mild hyponatremia occurs in patientstaking diuretics, but when combined with a low sodiumdiet or with the excessive drinking of water, severehyponatremia can develop.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1742HyponatremiaSevere and prolonged diarrhea can also cause\nhyponatremia. Severe diarrhea, causing the daily outputof 8–10 liters of fluid from the large intestines, results inthe loss of large amounts of water, sodium, and variousnutrients. Some diarrheal diseases release particularlylarge quantities of sodium and are therefore most likelyto cause hyponatremia.\nDrinking excess water sometimes causes hypona-\ntremia, because the absorption of water into the blood-stream can dilute the sodium in the blood. This cause ofhyponatremia is rare, but has been found in psychoticpatients who compulsively drink more than 20 liters ofwater per day. Excessive drinking of beer, which is main-ly water and low in sodium, can also produce hypona-tremia when combined with a poor diet.\nMarathon running, under certain conditions, leads to\nhyponatremia. Races of 25–50 miles can result in the lossof great quantities (8 to 10 liters) of sweat, which containsboth sodium and water. Studies show that about 30% ofmarathon runners experience mild hyponatremia during arace. But runners who consume only pure water during arace can develop severe hyponatremia because the drink-ing water dilutes the sodium in the bloodstream. Such run-ners may experience neurological disorders as a result ofthe severe hyponatremia and require emergency treatment.\nHyponatremia also develops from disorders in\norgans that control the body’s regulation of sodium orwater. The adrenal gland secretes a hormone calledaldosterone that travels to the kidney, where it causes thekidney to retain sodium by not excreting it into the urine.Addison’s disease causes hyponatremia as a result of\nlow levels of aldosterone due to damage to the adrenalgland. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are alsoinvolved in sodium regulation by making and releasingvasopressin, known as anti-diuretic hormone, into thebloodstream. Like aldosterone, vasopressin acts in thekidney, but it causes it to reduce the amount of waterreleased into urine. With more vasopressin production,the body conserves water, resulting in a lower concentra-tion of plasma sodium. Certain types of cancer cells pro-\nduce vasopressin, leading to hyponatremia.\nSymptoms of moderate hyponatremia include tired-\nness, disorientation, headache , muscle cramps, and nau-\nsea. Severe hyponatremia can lead to seizures and coma.These neurological symptoms are thought to result fromthe movement of water into brain cells, causing them toswell and disrupt their functioning.\nIn most cases of hyponatremia, doctors are primarily\nconcerned with discovering the underlying disease caus-ing the decline in plasma sodium levels. Death that\noccurs during hyponatremia is usually due to other fea-tures of the disease rather than to the hyponatremia itself.KEY TERMS\nBlood plasma and serum —Blood plasma, or plas-\nma, is prepared by obtaining a sample of bloodand removing the blood cells. The red blood cellsand white blood cells are removed by spinningwith a centrifuge. Chemicals are added to preventthe blood’s natural tendency to clot. If these chem-icals include sodium, than a false measurement ofplasma sodium content will result. Serum is pre-pared by obtaining a blood sample, allowing for-mation of the blood clot, and removing the clotusing a centrifuge. Both plasma and serum arelight yellow in color.\nDiagnosis\nHyponatremia is diagnosed by acquiring a blood sam-\nple, preparing plasma, and using a sodium-sensitive elec-trode for measuring the concentration of sodium ions.Unless the cause is obvious, a variety of tests are subse-quently run to determine if sodium was lost from the urine,diarrhea, or from vomiting. Tests are also used to determineabnormalities in aldosterone or vasopressin levels. Thepatient’s diet and use of diuretics must also be considered.\nTreatment\nSevere hyponatremia can be treated by infusing a\nsolution of 5% sodium chloride in water into the blood-stream. Moderate hyponatremia due to use of diuretics oran abnormal increase in vasopressin is often treated byinstructions to drink less water each day. Hyponatremiadue to adrenal gland insufficiency is treated with hor-mone injections.\nPrognosis\nHyponatremia is just one manifestation of a variety\nof disorders. While hyponatremia can easily be correct-ed, the prognosis for the underlying condition that causesit varies.\nPrevention\nPatients who take diuretic medications must be\nchecked regularly for the development of hyponatremia.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

Theresult is a low level of calcium in the blood.\nDescription\nParathyroid glands consist of four pea-shaped glands\nlocated on the back and side of the thyroid gland. Thegland produces parathyroid hormone which, along withvitamin D and calcitonin, are important for the regulationof the calcium level in the body. Hypoparathyroidismaffects both males and females of all ages.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe accidental removal of the parathyroid glands\nduring neck surgery is the most frequent cause ofhypoparathyroidism. Complications of surgery on theparathyroid glands is another common cause of this dis-order. There is the possibility of autoimmune genetic dis-orders causing hypoparathyroidism such as Hashimoto’sthyroiditis ,pernicious anemia , and Addison’s disease .\nThe destruction of the gland by radiation is a rare causeof hypoparathyroidism. Occasionally, the parathyroidsare absent at birth causing low calcium levels and possi-ble convulsions in the newborn. Symptoms in theadvanced and continuous stages of hypoparathyroidisminclude splitting of the nails, inadequate tooth develop-ment and mental retardation in children, and seizures.\nAbnormal low levels of calcium result in irritability\nof nerves, causing numbness and tingling of the hands\nand feet, with painful-cramp like muscle spasms knownas tetany.

Cancers of thefemale breast and male prostate grow faster in the pres-ence of sex hormones. It used to be that sex hormonescould be suppressed only by removing their source, theglands that made them. After the gonads were removed,some cancers continued to grow, so other stimulants totheir growth had to removed. At this point, some cancer\nspecialists turned to the pituitary.\nWith the development of new therapeutic agents and\nmethods, especially new ways to manipulate hormoneswithout removing their source, this type of endocrinesurgery has been largely relegated to history.

Hormone pro-duction is usually triggered by the pituitary gland.\ntumors develop in the pituitary gland that require\nremoval. Here, the idea is to remove the tumor but par-tially preserve the gland.\nDescription\nThere are several surgical approaches to the pitu-\nitary. The surgeon will choose the best one for the specif-ic procedure. The pituitary lies directly behind the nose,and access through the nose or the sinuses is often thebest approach. Opening the skull and lifting the frontallobe of the brain will expose the delicate neck of the pitu-itary gland. This approach works best if tumors haveextended above the pituitary fossa (the cavity in whichthe gland lies).\nNewer surgical methods using technology have\nmade other approaches possible. Stereotaxis is a three-dimensional aiming technique using x rays or scans forguidance. Instruments can be placed in the brain withpinpoint accuracy through tiny holes in the skull.These instruments can then manipulate brain tissue,either to destroy it or remove it. Stereotaxis is alsoused to direct radiation with similar precision using agamma knife. Access to some brain lesions can begained through the blood vessels using tiny tubes andwires guided by x rays.\nPreparation\nPituitary surgery is performed by neurosurgeons\ndeep inside the skull.

    "title": "Hypopituitarism",
    "content": "Hypopituitarism\nDefinition\nHypopituitarism is loss of function in an endocrine\ngland due to failure of the pituitary gland to secrete hor-mones which stimulate that gland’s function. The pituitarygland is located at the base of the brain. Patients diagnosedwith hypopituitarism may be deficient in one single hor-mone, several hormones, or have complete pituitary failure.Description\nThe pituitary is a pea-sized gland located at the base\nof the brain, and surrounded by bone. The hypothalamus,another endocrine organ in the brain, controls the func-tion of the pituitary gland by providing “hormonalorders.” In turn, the pituitary gland regulates the manyhormones that control various functions and organs with-in the body. The posterior pituitary acts as a sort of stor-age area for the hypothalamus and passes on hormonesthat control function of the muscles and kidneys. Theanterior pituitary produces its own hormones which helpto regulate several endocrine functions.\nIn hypopituitarism, something interferes with the\nproduction and release of these hormones, thus affectingthe function of the target gland. Commonly affected hor-mones may include:\nGonadotropin deficiency\nGonadotropin deficiency involves two distinct hor-\nmones affecting the reproductive system. Luteinizinghormone (LH) stimulates the testes in men and theovaries in women. This deficiency can affect fertility inmen and women and menstruation in women. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has similar effects to LH.\nThyroid stimulating hormone deficiency\nThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is involved in\nstimulation of the thyroid gland. A lack of stimulation inthe gland leads to hypothyroidism .\nAdrenocorticotopic hormone deficiency\nAlso known as corticotropin, adrenocorticotopic\nhormone (ACTH) stimulates the adrenal gland to pro-duce a hormone similar to cortisone, called cortisol. Theloss of this hormone can lead to serious problems.\nGrowth hormone deficiency\nGrowth hormone (GH) regulates the body’s growth.\nPatients who lose supply of this hormone before physicalmaturity will suffer impaired growth. Loss of the hor-mone can also affect adults.\nOther hormone deficiencies\nProlactin stimulates the female breast to produce\nmilk. A hormone produced by the posterior pituitary,antidiuretic hormone (ADH), controls the function of thekidneys. When this hormone is deficient, diabetes\ninsipidus can result. However, patients with hypopitu-\nitarism rarely suffer ADH deficiency, unless the hypopi-tuitarism is the result of hypothalamus disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1746HypopituitarismMultiple hormone deficiencies\nDeficiency of a single pituitary hormone occurs less\ncommonly than deficiency of more than one hormone.Sometimes referred to as progressive pituitary hormonedeficiency or partial hypopituitarism, there is usually apredictable order of hormone loss. Generally, growthhormone is lost first, then luteinizing hormone deficiencyfollows. The loss of follicle-stimulating hormone, thy-roid stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotopic hor-mones follow much later. The progressive loss of pitu-itary hormone secretion is usually a slow process, whichcan occur over a period of months or years. Hypopitu-itarism does occasionally start suddenly with rapid onsetof symptoms.\nPanhypopituitarism\nThis condition represents the loss of all hormones\nreleased by the anterior pituitary gland. Panhypopitu-itarism is also known as complete pituitary failure.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are three major mechanisms which lead to the\ndevelopment of hypopituitarism. The first involvesdecreased release of hypothalamic hormones that stimu-late pituitary function. The cause of decreased hypothala-mic function may be congenital or acquired throughinterference such as tumors, inflammation, infection,mass lesions or interruption of blood supply. A secondcategory of causes is any event or mass which interruptsthe delivery of hormones from the hypothalamus. Thesemay include particular tumors and aneurysms. Damageto the pituitary stalk from injury or surgery can also leadto hypopituitarism.\nThe third cause of hypopituitarism is damage to the\npituitary gland cells. Destroyed cells can not produce thepituitary hormones that would normally be secreted bythe gland. Cells may be destroyed by a number of tumorsand diseases. Hypopituitarism is often caused by tumors,the most common of which is pituitary adenoma.\nSymptoms of hypopituitarism vary with the affected\nhormones and severity of deficiency. Frequently, patientshave had years of symptoms that were nonspecific until amajor illness or stress occurred. Overall symptoms may\ninclude fatigue , sensitivity to cold, weakness, decreased\nappetite, weight loss and abdominal pain . Low blood\npressure, headache and visual disturbances are other\nassociated symptoms.\nGonadotropin deficiency\nSymptoms specific to this hormone deficiency\ninclude decreased interest in sex for women and infertil-ityin women and men. Women may also have premature\ncessation of menstruation, hot flashes, vaginal drynessand pain during intercourse. Women who are post-menopausal will not have obvious symptoms such asthese and may first present with headache or loss ofvision. Men may also suffer sexual dysfunction as a\nresult of gonadotropin deficiency. In acquiredgonadotropin deficiency, both men and women maynotice loss of body hair.\nThyroid stimulating hormone deficiency\nIntolerance to cold, fatigue, weight gain, constipa-\ntion and pale, waxy and dry skin indicate thyroid hor-\nmone deficiency.\nAdrenocorticotopic hormone deficiency\nSymptoms of ACTH deficiency include fatigue,\nweakness, weight loss and low blood pressure. Nausea,pale skin and loss of pubic and armpit hair in womenmay also indicate deficiency of ACTH.\nGrowth hormone deficiency\nIn children, growth hormone deficiency will result in\nshort stature and growth retardation. Symptoms such asobesity and skin wrinkling may or may not show in\nadults and normal release of growth hormone normallydeclines with age.\nOther hormone deficiencies\nProlactin deficiency is rare and is the result of partial\nor generalized anterior pituitary failure. When present,the symptom is absence of milk production in women.There are no known symptoms for men. ADH deficiencymay produce symptoms of diabetes insipidus, such asexcessive thirst and frequent urination.\nMultiple hormone deficiencies\nPatients with multiple hormone deficiencies will\nshow symptoms of one or more specific hormone deficien-cies or some of the generalized symptoms listed above.\nPanhypopituitarism\nThe absence of any pituitary function should show\nsymptoms of one or all of the specific hormone deficien-cies. In addition to those symptoms, patients may havedry, pale skin that is finely textured. The face may appearfinely wrinkled and contain a disinterested expression.\nDiagnosis\nOnce the diagnosis of a single hormone deficiency is\nmade, it is strongly recommended that tests for other hor-mone deficiencies be conducted.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1747HypopituitarismGonadotropin deficiency\nThe detection of low levels of gonadotropin can be\naccomplished through simple blood tests which measureluteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone,simultaneously with gonadal steroid levels. The combi-nation of results can indicate to a physician if the causeof decreased hormone levels or function belongs tohypopituitarism or some sort of primary gonadal failure.Diagnosis will vary among men and women.\nThyroid stimulating hormone deficiency\nLaboratory tests measuring thyroid function can\nhelp determine a diagnosis of TSH deficiency. The com-monly used tests are T4 and TSH measurement donesimultaneously to determine the reserve, or pool, of thy-roid-stimulating hormone.\nAdrenocorticotopic hormone deficiency\nAn insulin tolerance test may be given to determine\nif cortisol levels rise when hypoglycemia is induced. If\nthey do not rise, there is insufficient reserve of cortisol,indicating an ACTH deficiency. If the insulin tolerancetest is not safe for a particular patient, a glucagon testoffers similar results. A CRH (corticotropin-releasinghormone) test may also be given. It involves injection ofCRH to measure, through regularly drawn blood sam-ples, a resulting rise in ACTH and cortisol. Other testswhich stimulate ACTH may be ordered.\nGrowth hormone deficiency\nGrowth hormone deficiency is measured through the\nuse of insulin-like growth factor I tests, which measuregrowth factors that are dependent on growth hormones.Sleep and exercise studies may also be used to test for\ngrowth hormone deficiency, since these activities areknown to stimulate growth hormone secretion. Severaldrugs also induce secretion of growth hormone and maybe given to measure hormone response. The standard testfor growth hormone deficiency is the insulin-inducedhypoglycemia test. This test does carry some risk fromthe induced hypoglycemia. Other tests include an argi-nine infusion test, clonidine test and growth-hormonereleasing hormone test.\nOther hormone deficiencies\nIf a test calculates normal levels of prolactin, defi-\nciency of the hormone is eliminated as a diagnosis. ATRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) simulation test candetermine prolactin levels. A number of tests are avail-able to detect ADH levels and to determine diagnosis ofdiabetes insipidus.Multiple and general hypopituitarism tests\nPhysicians should be aware that nonspecific symp-\ntoms can indicate deficiency of one or more hormonesand should conduct a thorough clinical history. In general,diagnosis of hypopituitarism can be accomplished with acombination of dynamic tests and simple blood tests, aswell as imaging exams. Most of these tests can be con-ducted in an outpatient lab or radiology facility. Magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) exams with gadolinium con-\ntrast enhancement are preferred imaging exams to studythe region of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. WhenMRI is not available, a properly conducted computedtomography scan (CT scan) exam can take its place.These exams can demonstrate a tumor or other mass,which may be interfering with pituitary function.\nPanhypopituitarism\nThe insulin-induced hypoglycemia, or insulin toler-\nance test, which is used to determine specific hormonedeficiencies, is an excellent test to diagnose panhypopi-tuitarism. This test can reveal levels of growth hormone,ACTH (cortisol) and prolactin deficiency. The presenceof insufficient levels of all of these hormones is a goodindication of complete pituitary failure. Imaging studiesand clinical history are also important.\nTreatment\nTreatment differs widely, depending on the age and\nsex of the patient, severity of the deficiency, the numberof hormones involved, and even the underlying cause ofthe hypopituitarism. Immediate hormone replacement isgenerally administered to replace the specific deficienthormone. Patient education is encouraged to helppatients manage the impact of their hormone deficiencyon daily life. For instance, certain illnesses, accidents orsurgical procedures may have adverse complications dueto hypopituitarism.\nGonadotropin deficiency\nReplacement of gonadal steroids is common treat-\nment for LH and FSH deficiency. Estrogen for womenand testosterone for men will be prescribed in the low-est effective dosage possible, since there can be com-plications to this therapy. To correct women’s loss oflibido, small doses of androgens may be prescribed. Torestore fertility in men, regular hormone injectionsmay be required. Male and female patients whosehypopituitarism results from hypothalamic diseasemay be successfully treated with a hypothalamicreleasing hormone (GnRH), which can restore gonadalfunction and fertility.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1748HypopituitarismThyroid stimulating hormone deficiency\nIn patients who have hypothyroidism, the function of\nthe adrenal glands will be tested and treated with steroidsbefore administering thyroid hormone replacement.\nAdrenocorticotopic hormone deficiency\nHydrocortisone or cortisone in divided doses may be\ngiven to replace this hormone deficiency. Most patientsrequire 20 mg or less of hydrocortisone per day.\nGrowth hormone deficiency\nIt is essential to treat children suffering from growth\nhormone deficiency. The effectiveness of growth hor-mone therapy in adults, particularly elderly adults, is notas well documented. It is thought to help restore normalmuscle to fat ratios. Growth hormone is an expensive andcautiously prescribed treatment.\nTreatment of multiple deficiencies and\npanhypopituitarism\nThe treatment of hypopituitarism is usually very\nstraightforward, but must normally continue for theremainder of the patient’s life. Some patients mayreceive treatment with GnRH, the hypothalamic hor-mone. In most cases, treatment will be based on the spe-cific deficiency demonstrated. Patients with hypopitu-itarism should be followed regularly to measure treat-ment effectiveness and to avoid overtreatment with hor-mone therapy. If the cause of the disorder is a tumor orlesion, radiation or surgical removal are treatmentoptions. Successful removal may reverse the hypopitu-itarism. However, even after removal of the mass, hor-\nmone replacement therapy may still be necessary.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for most patients with hypopitu-\nitarism is excellent. As long as therapy is continued,many experience normal life spans. However, hypopitu-itarism is usually a permanent condition and prognosisdepends on the primary cause of the disorder. It can bepotentially life threatening, particularly when acutehypopituitarism occurs as a result of a large pituitarytumor. Morbidity from the disease has increased,although the cause is not known. It is possible thatincreased morbidity and death are due to overtreatment\nwith hormones. Any time that recovery of pituitary func-tion can occur is preferred to lifelong hormone therapy.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention of hypopituitarism,\nexcept for prevention of damage to the pituitary/hypo-thalamic area from injury.KEY TERMS\nAdenoma —A benign (not threatening or cancer-\nous) tumor that originates in a gland.\nAndrogen —A hormone that usually stimulates the\nsex hormones of the male.\nCongenital —Present at birth.\nDiabetes insipidus —A disorder originating in the\npituitary gland which is characterized by exces-sive thirst and urination.\nEndocrine —Refers to the system of internal secre-\ntion of substances into the body system fromglands.\nHypoglycemia —Abnormal decrease of sugar in\nthe blood.\nHypothyroidism —Deficient activity of the thyroid\ngland and resulting loss of energy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCurrent Diagnosis.

    "content": "Hypospadias and epispadias\nDefinition\nHypospadias is a congenital defect, primarily of\nmales, in which the urethra opens on the underside (ven-trum) of the penis. The corresponding defect in femalesis an opening of the urethra into the vagina and is rare.\nEpispadias (also called bladder exstrophy) is a con-\ngenital defect of males in which the urethra opens on the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1749Hypospadias and epispadiasupper surface (dorsum) of the penis. The corresponding\ndefect in females is a fissure in the upper wall of the ure-thra and is quite rare.\nDescription\nIn a male, the external opening of the urinary tract\n(external meatus) is normally located at the tip of thepenis. In a female, it is normally located between the cli-toris and the vagina.\nIn males with hypospadias, the urethra opens on the\ninferior surface or underside of the penis. In femaleswith hypospadias, the urethra opens into the cavity ofthe vagina.\nIn males with epispadias, the urethra opens on the\nsuperior surface or upper side of the penis. In femaleswith epispadias, there is a crack or fissure in the wall ofthe urethra and out of the body through an opening in theskin above the clitoris.\nDuring the embryological development of males, a\ngroove of tissue folds inward and then fuses to form atube that becomes the urethra. Hypospadias occurs whenthe tube does not form or does not fuse completely. Epis-padias is due to a defect in the tissue that folds inward toform the urethra.\nDuring the development of a female, similar\nprocesses occur to form the urethra. The problem is usu-ally insufficient length of the tube that becomes the ure-thra. As a result, the urethra opens in an abnormal loca-tion, resulting in a hypospadias. Occasionally, fissuresform in the bladder. These may extend to the surface of\nthe abdomen and fuse with the adjacent skin. This ismost often identified as a defect in the bladder althoughit is technically an epispadias.\nHypospadias in males generally occur alone. Female\nhypospadias may be associated with abnormalities of thegenital tract, since the urinary and genital tracts areformed in the same embryonic process.\nBecause it represents incomplete development of the\npenis, some experts think that insufficient male hormonemay be responsible for hypospadias.\nIn males, the incidence of hypospadias is approxi-\nmately one per 250 to 300 live births. Epispadias is muchless common, having an incidence of about one per100,000 live male births.\nIn females, hypospadias is much less common than\nin males. It appears about once in every 500,000 livefemale births. Epispadias is even rarer. Reliable esti-mates of the prevalence of epispadias in females are notavailable. Epispadias in females is often diagnosed andrecorded as a bladder anomaly.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypospadias and epispadias are congenital defects\nof the urinary tract. This means that they occur duringintrauterine development. There is no genetic basis forthe defects. Specific causes for hypospadias are notknown. This means that blood relatives do not haveincreased chances of developing them.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1750Hypospadias and epispadiasForeskin\nUrethral\nopening\nIn hypospadias, the urethra opens along the penile shaft rather than at the penile tip. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)Hypospadias is usually not associated with other\ndefects of the penis or urethra. In males, it can occur atany site along the underside of the penis. In females, theurethra exits the body in an abnormal location. This isusually due to inadequate length of the urethra.\nEpispadias is associated with bladder abnormali-\nties. In females, the front wall of the bladder does notfuse or close. The bladder fissure may extend to theexternal abdominal wall. In such a rare case, the frontof the pelvis is also widely separated. In males, thebladder fissure extends into the urethra and simplybecomes an opening somewhere along the upper sur-face of the penis.\nHypospadias is associated with difficulty in assign-\ning gender to babies. This occurs when gender is notobvious at birth because of deformities in the sex organs.\nDiagnosis\nMale external urinary tract defects are discovered at\nbirth during the first detailed examination of the newborn.Female urethral defects may not be discovered for sometime due to the difficulty in viewing the infant vagina.\nTreatment\nSurgery is the treatment of choice for both hypospa-\ndias and epispadias. All surgical repairs should be under-taken early and completed without delay. This minimizespsychological trauma.\nIn males with hypospadias, one surgery is usually\nsufficient to repair the defect. With more complicatedhypospadias (more than one abnormally situated urethralopening), multiple surgeries may be required. In femaleswith hypospadias, surgical repair is technically morecomplicated but can usually be completed in a briefinterval of time.\nRepairing an epispadias is more difficult. In males,\nthis may involve other structures in the penis. Malesshould not be circumcised since the foreskin is oftenneeded for the repair. Unfortunately, choices may berequired that affect the ability to inseminate a femalepartner. Reproduction requires that the urethral meatusbe close to the tip of the penis. Cosmetic appearance andurinary continence are usually the primary goals. Surgeryfor these defects is successful 70 to 80% of the time.Modern treatment of complete male epispadias allowsfor an excellent genital appearance and achievement ofurinary continence.\nIn females, repair of epispadias may require multiple\nsurgical procedures. Urinary continence and cosmeticappearance are the usual primary considerations. Urinarycontinence is usually achieved although cosmetic\nappearance may be somewhat compromised. Fertility isnot usually affected. Repair rates that are similar or betterthan those for males can usually be achieved for females.\nHypospadias in both males and females is more of a\nnuisance and hindrance to reproduction than a threat tohealth. If surgery is not an option, the condition may beallowed to persist. This usually leads to an increased riskof infections in the lower urinary tract.\nPrognosis\nWith adequate surgical repair, most males with simple\nhypospadias can lead normal lives with a penis that appearsand functions in a normal manner. This includes fatheringchildren. Females with simple hypospadias also have nor-mal lives, including conceiving and bearing children.\nThe prognosis for epispadias depends on the extent of\nthe defect. Most males with relatively minor epispadiaslead normal lives, including fathering children. As theextent of the defect increases, surgical reconstruction isgenerally acceptable. However, many of these men areunable to conceive children. Most epispadias in femalescan be surgically repaired. The chances of residual disfig-urement increase as the extent of the epispadias increases.Fertility in females is not generally affected by epispadias.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDuckett, John W. “Hypospadias.” In Campbell’s Urology .

Some healthy people\nhave blood pressure well below the average for their age,even though they have a completely normal heart and bloodvessels. This is often true of athletes who are in superiorshape. The term “hypotension” is usually used only whenblood pressure has fallen so far that enough blood can nolonger reach the brain, causing dizziness and fainting .\nCauses and symptoms\nPostural hypotension is the most common type of\nlow blood pressure. In this condition, symptoms appearafter a person sits up or stands quickly. In normal people,the cardiovascular system must make a quick adjustmentto raise blood pressure slightly to account for the changein position. For those with postural hypotension, theblood pressure adjustment is not adequate or it doesn’thappen. Postural hypotension may occur if someone istaking certain drugs or medicine for high blood pressure.It also happens to diabetics when nerve damage has dis-rupted the reflexes that control blood pressure.\nMany people have a chronic problem with low blood\npressure that is not particularly serious. This may includepeople who require certain medications, who are preg-nant, have bad veins, or have arteriosclerosis (hardeningof the arteries).\nThe most serious problem with low blood pressure\noccurs when there is a sudden drop, which can be life-threatening due to widespread ischemia (insufficient\nsupply of blood to an organ due to blockage in an artery).This type of low blood pressure may be due to a widevariety of causes, including:\n• trauma with extensive blood loss• serious burns• shock from various causes (e.g. anaphylaxis)• heart attack• adrenal failure (Addisonian crisis)• cancer• severe fever• serious infection (septicemia)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1752HypotensionDiagnosis\nBlood pressure is a measure of the pressure in the\narteries created by the heart contracting. During the day,a normal person’s blood pressure changes constantly,depending on activity. Low blood pressure can be diag-nosed by taking the blood pressure with a sphygmo-manometer. This is a device with a soft rubber cuff that isinflated around the upper arm until it’s tight enough tostop blood flow. The cuff is then slowly deflated until thehealth care worker, listening to the artery in the arm witha stethoscope, can hear the blood first as a beat forcingits way along the artery. This is the systolic pressure. Thecuff is then deflated more until the beat disappears andthe blood flows steadily through the open artery; thisgives the diastolic pressure.\nBlood pressure is recorded as systolic (higher) and\ndiastolic (lower) pressures. A healthy young adult has ablood pressure of about 110/75, which typically riseswith age to about 140/90 by age 60 (a reading now con-sidered mildly elevated).\nTreatment\nTreatment of low blood pressure depends on the\nunderlying cause, which can usually be resolved. Forthose people with postural hypotension, a medicationadjustment may help prevent the problem. These individ-uals may find that rising more slowly, or getting out ofbed in slow stages, helps the problem. Low blood pres-sure with no other symptoms does not need to be treated.\nPrognosis\nLow blood pressure as a result of injury or other\nunderlying condition can usually be successfully treatedif the trauma is not too extensive or is treated in time.Less serious forms of chronic low blood pressure have agood prognosis and do not require treatment.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSmeltzer, Suzanne C., and Brenda G.

In the United States,hypothermia is primarily an urban phenomenon associat-ed with alcoholism , drug addiction , mental illness, and\ncold—water immersion accidents. The victims are oftenhomeless male alcoholics. Officially, 11,817 deaths wereattributed to hypothermia in the United States from 1979to 1994, but experts suspect that many fatal cases gounrecognized. Nearly half the victims were 65 or older,with males dominating every age group. Nonwhites werealso overrepresented in the statistics. Among males 65and older, nonwhites outnumbered whites by more thanfour to one.\nCauses and symptoms\nMeasured orally, a healthy person’s body tempera-\nture can fluctuate between 97°F (36.1°C) and 100°F(37.8°C). Survival depends on maintaining temperaturestability within this range by balancing the heat producedby metabolism with the heat lost to the environmentthrough (for the most part) the skin and lungs. Whenenvironmental or other changes cause heat loss to out-pace heat production, the brain triggers physiologicaland behavioral responses to restore the balance. Theinvoluntary muscular activity of shivering, for example,aids heat production by accelerating metabolism. But ifthe cold stress is too great and the body’s defenses are\noverwhelmed, body temperature begins to fall.Hypothermia is considered to begin once body tempera-ture reaches 95°F (35°C), though even smaller drops intemperature can have an adverse effect.\nHypothermia is divided into two types: primary\nand secondary. Primary hypothermia occurs when thebody’s heat-balancing mechanisms are working prop-erly but are subjected to extreme cold, whereas sec-ondary hypothermia affects people whose heat-balanc-ing mechanisms are impaired in some way and cannotrespond adequately to moderate or perhaps even mildcold. Primary hypothermia typically involves exposureto cold air or immersion in cold water. The cold air\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1753Hypothermiavariety usually takes at least several hours to develop,\nbut immersion hypothermia will occur within about anhour of entering the water, since water draws heataway from the body much faster than air does. In sec-ondary hypothermia, the body’s heat-balancing mecha-nisms can fail for any number of reasons, includingstrokes, diabetes, malnutrition , bacterial infection,\nthyroid disease, spinal cord injuries (which prevent thebrain from receiving crucial temperature-related infor-mation from other parts of the body), and the use ofmedications and other substances that affect the brainor spinal cord. Alcohol is one such substance. In small-er amounts it can put people at risk by interfering withtheir ability to recognize and avoid cold-weather dan-gers. In larger amounts it shuts down the body’s heat-balancing mechanisms.\nSecondary hypothermia is often a threat to the\nelderly, who may be on medications or suffering fromillnesses that affect their ability to conserve heat. Mal-nutrition and immobility can also put the elderly atrisk. Some medical research suggests as well thatshivering and blood vessel narrowing—two of thebody’s defenses against cold—may not be triggered asquickly in older people. For these and other reasons,the elderly can, over a period of days or even weeks,fall victim to hypothermia in poorly insulated homesor other surroundings that family, friends, and care-givers may not recognize as life threatening. Anotherrisk for the elderly is the fact that hypothermia caneasily be misdiagnosed as a stroke or some other\ncommon illness of old age.\nThe signs and symptoms of hypothermia follow a\ntypical course, though the body temperatures at whichthey occur vary from person to person depending onage, health, and other factors. The impact of hypother-mia on the nervous system often becomes apparent quiteearly. Coordination, for instance, may begin to suffer assoon as body temperature reaches 95°F (35°C). Theearly signs of hypothermia also include cold and paleskin and intense shivering; the latter stops between 90°F(32.2°C) and 86°F (30°C). As body temperature contin-ues to fall, speech becomes slurred, the muscles gorigid, and the victim becomes disoriented and experi-ences eyesight problems. Other harmful consequencesinclude dehydration as well as liver and kidney failure.\nHeart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure rise dur-ing the first stages of hypothermia, but fall once the90°F (32.2°C) mark is passed. Below 86°F (30°C) mostvictims are comatose, and below 82°F (27.8°C) theheart’s rhythm becomes dangerously disordered. Yeteven at very low body temperatures, people can survivefor several hours and be successfully revived, thoughthey may appear to be dead.Diagnosis\nInformation on the patient’s prior health and activi-\nties often helps doctors establish a correct diagnosis andtreatment plan. Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, andrespiration require immediate monitoring. Because thetemperature of the mouth is not an accurate guide to thebody’s core temperature, readings are taken at one or twoother sites, usually the ear, rectum, or esophagus. Otherdiagnostic tools include electrocardiography , which is\nused to evaluate heart rhythm, and blood and urine tests,which provide several kinds of key information; a chest\nx ray is also required. A computed tomography scan (CT\nscan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be\nneeded to check for head and other injuries.\nTreatment\nEmergency medical help should be summoned when-\never a person appears hypothermic. The danger signsinclude intense shivering; stiffness and numbness in thearms and legs; stumbling and clumsiness; sleepiness, con-fusion, disorientation, amnesia , and irrational behavior;\nand difficulty speaking. Until emergency help arrives, avictim of outdoor hypothermia should be brought to shel-ter and warmed by removing wet clothing and footwear,drying the skin, and wrapping him or her in warm blanketsor a sleeping bag. Gentle handling is necessary when mov-ing the victim to avoid disturbing the heart. Rubbing theskin or giving the victim alcohol can be harmful, thoughwarm drinks such as clear soup and tea are recommendedfor those who can swallow. Anyone who aids a victim ofhypothermia should also look for signs of frostbite and beaware that attempting to rewarm a frostbitten area of thebody before emergency help arrives can be extremely dan-gerous. For this reason, frostbitten areas must be keptaway from heat sources such as campfires and car heaters.\nRewarming is the essence of hospital treatment for\nhypothermia. How rewarming proceeds depends on thebody temperature. Different approaches are used forpatients who are mildly hypothermic (the patient’s bodytemperature is 90–95°F [32.2–35°C]), moderatelyhypothermic (86–90°F [30–32.2°C]), or severelyhypothermic (less than 86°F [30°C]). Other considera-tions, such as the patient’s age or the condition of theheart, can also influence treatment choices.\nMild hypothermia is reversed with passive rewarm-\ning. This technique relies on the patient’s own metabo-lism to rewarm the body. Once wet clothing is removedand the skin is dried, the patient is covered with blanketsand placed in a warm room. The goal is to raise thepatient’s temperature by 0.5–2°C an hour.\nModerate hypothermia is often treated first with\nactive external rewarming and then with passive rewarm-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1754Hypothermiaing. Active external rewarming involves applying heat to\nthe skin, for instance by placing the patient in a warmbath or wrapping the patient in electric heating blankets.\nSevere hypothermia requires active internal rewarm-\ning, which is recommended for some cases of moderatehypothermia as well. There are several types of activeinternal rewarming. Cardiopulmonary bypass, in whichthe patient’s blood is circulated through a rewarmingdevice and then returned to the body, is considered thebest, and can raise body temperature by 1–2°C every 3–5minutes. However, many hospitals are not equipped tooffer this treatment. The alternative is to introduce warmoxygen or fluids into the body.\nHypothermia treatment can also include, among\nother things, insulin, antibiotics , and fluid replacement\ntherapy. When the heart has stopped, both cardiopul-\nmonary resuscitation (CPR ) and rewarming are neces-\nsary. Once a patient’s condition has stabilized, he or shemay need treatment for an underlying problem such asalcoholism or thyroid disease.\nPrognosis\nVictims of mild or moderate hypothermia usually\nenjoy a complete recovery. In regard to severely hypother-mic patients, the prognosis for survival varies due to dif-ferences in people’s physiological responses to cold.\nPrevention\nPeople who spend time outdoors in cold weather can\nreduce heat loss by wearing their clothing loosely and inlayers and by keeping their hands, feet, and head well cov-ered (30–50% of body heat is lost through the head).Because water draws heat away from the body so easily,staying dry is important, and wet clothing and footwearshould be replaced as quickly as possible. Wind- and water-resistant outer garments are also crucial. Alcohol should beavoided because it promotes heat loss by expanding theblood vessels that carry body heat to the skin.\nPreventing hypothermia among the elderly requires\nvigilance on the part of family, friends, and caregivers. Anelderly person’s home should be properly insulated andheated, with living areas kept at a temperature of 70°F(21.1°C). Warm clothing and bedding are essential, as areadequate food, rest, and exercise ; warming the bed and\nbedroom before going to sleep is also recommended. Olderpeople who live alone should be visited regularly—at leastonce a day during very cold weather—to ensure that theirhealth remains sound and that they are taking good care ofthemselves.

Because T4regu-\nlates such essential functions as heart rate, digestion,physical growth, and mental development, an insufficientsupply of this hormone can slow life-sustaining process-es, damage organs and tissues in every part of the body,and lead to life-threatening complications.\nDescription\nHypothyroidism is one of the most common chronic\ndiseases in the United States. Symptoms may not appearuntil years after the thyroid has stopped functioning andthey are often mistaken for signs of other illnesses,menopause , or aging . Although this condition is\nbelieved to affect as many as 11 million adults and chil-dren, as many as two of every three people with hypothy-roidism may not know they have the disease.\nNicknamed “Gland Central” because it influences\nalmost every organ, tissue, and cell in the body, the thy-roid is shaped like a butterfly and located just below theAdam’s apple. The thyroid stores iodine the body getsfrom food and uses this mineral to create T\n4. Low T4lev-\nels can alter weight, appetite, sleep patterns, body tem-perature, sex drive, and a variety of other physical, men-tal, and emotional characteristics.\nThere are three types of hypothyroidism. The most\ncommon is primary hypothyroidism, in which the thy-roid doesn’t produce an adequate amount of T\n4. Sec-\nondary hypothyroidism develops when the pituitarygland does not release enough of the thyroid-stimulatinghormone (TSH) that prompts the thyroid to manufactureT\n4. Tertiary hypothyroidism results from a malfunction\nof the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controlsthe endocrine system. Drug-induced hypothyroidism, anadverse reaction to medication, occurs in two of every10,000 people, but rarely causes severe hypothyroidism.\nHypothyroidism is at least twice as common in women\nas it is in men. Although hypothyroidism is most commonin women who are middle-aged or older, the disease canoccur at any age. Newborn infants are tested for congenitalthyroid deficiency (cretinism) using a test that measures thelevels of thyroxine in the infant’s blood. Treatment withinthe first few months of life can prevent mental retardation\nand physical abnormalities. Older children who develophypothyroidism suddenly stop growing.\nFactors that increase a person’s risk of developing\nhypothyroidism include age, weight, and medical history.Women are more likely to develop the disease after age50; men, after age 60. Obesity also increases risk. A\nfamily history of thyroid problems or a personal historyof high cholesterol levels or such autoimmune diseases\nas lupus, rheumatoid arthritis , or diabetes can make an\nindividual more susceptible to hypothyroidism.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypothyroidism is most often the result of\nHashimoto’s disease, also known as chronic thyroiditis\n(inflammation of the thyroid gland). In this disease, theimmune system fails to recognize that the thyroid glandis part of the body’s own tissue and attacks it as if it werea foreign body. The attack by the immune system impairsthyroid function and sometimes destroys the gland.Other causes of hypothyroidism include:\n• Radiation. Radioactive iodine used to treat hyperthy-\nroidism (overactive thyroid) or radiation treatments for\nhead or neck cancers can destroy the thyroid gland.\n• Surgery. Removal of the thyroid gland because of can-\nceror other thyroid disorders can result in hypothy-\nroidism.\n• Viruses and bacteria. Infections that depress thyroid\nhormone production usually cause permanent hypothy-roidism.\n• Medication. Nitroprusside, lithium, or iodides can\ninduce hypothyroidism. Because patients who use thesemedications are closely monitored by their doctors, thisside effect is very rare.\n• Pituitary gland malfunction. This is a rare condition in\nwhich the pituitary gland fails to produce enough TSHto activate the thyroid’s production of T\n4.\n• Congenital defect. One of every 4,000 babies is born\nwithout a properly functioning thyroid gland.\n• Diet. Because the thyroid makes T4from iodine drawn\nfrom food, an iodine-deficient diet can cause hypothy-roidism. Adding iodine to table salt and other commonfoods has eliminated iodine deficiency in the UnitedStates. Certain foods (cabbage, rutabagas, peanuts,peaches, soybeans, spinach) can interfere with thyroidhormone production.\n• Environmental contaminants. Certain man-made chem-\nicals-such as PCBs-found in the local environment athigh levels may also cause hypothyroidism.\nHypothyroidism is sometimes referred to as a “silent”\ndisease because early symptoms may be so mild that noone realizes anything is wrong. Untreated symptomsbecome more noticeable and severe, and can lead to con-fusion and mental disorders, breathing difficulties, heartproblems, fluctuations in body temperature, and death .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1756HypothyroidismSomeone who has hypothyroidism will probably\nhave more than one of the following symptoms:\n• fatigue\n• decreased heart rate\n• progressive hearing loss\n• weight gain\n• problems with memory and concentration\n• depression\n• goiter (enlarged thyroid gland)\n• muscle pain or weakness\n• loss of interest in sex\n• numb, tingling hands\n• dry skin• swollen eyelids\n• dryness, loss, or premature graying of hair\n• extreme sensitivity to cold•constipation\n• irregular menstrual periods\n• hoarse voice\nHypothyroidism usually develops gradually. When\nthe disease results from surgery or other treatment forhyperthyroidism, symptoms may appear suddenly andinclude severe muscle cramps in the arms, legs, neck,shoulders, and back.\nIt’s important to see a doctor if any of these symp-\ntoms appear unexpectedly. People whose hypothy-roidism remains undiagnosed and untreated may eventu-ally develop myxedema. Symptoms of this rare butpotentially deadly complication include enlarged tongue,swollen facial features, hoarseness, and physical andmental sluggishness.\nMyxedema coma can cause unresponsiveness; irreg-\nular, shallow breathing; and a drop in blood pressure andbody temperature. The onset of this medical emergencycan be sudden in people who are elderly or have been ill,injured, or exposed to very cold temperatures; who haverecently had surgery; or who use sedatives or anti-depressants. Without immediate medical attention,myxedema coma can be fatal.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on the\npatient’s observations, medical history, physical exami-\nnation , and thyroid function tests . Doctors who spe-\ncialize in treating thyroid disorders (endocrinologists)are most apt to recognize subtle symptoms and physicalindications of hypothyroidism.

A woman being tested for\nhypothyroidism should let her doctor know if she is preg-nant or breastfeeding and all patients should be sure theirdoctors are aware of any recent procedures involvingradioactive materials or contrast media.\nThe TSH assay is extremely accurate, but some doc-\ntors doubt the test’s ability to detect mild hypothy-roidism. They advise patients to monitor their basal (rest-ing) body temperature for below-normal readings thatcould indicate the presence of hypothyroidism.\nTreatment\nNatural or synthetic thyroid hormones are used to\nrestore normal (euthyroid) thyroid hormone levels. Syn-thetic hormones are more effective than natural substances,but it may take several months to determine the correctdosage. Patients start to feel better within 48 hours, butsymptoms will return if they stop taking the medication.\nMost doctors prescribe levothyroxine sodium tablets,\nand most people with hypothyroidism will take the med-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1757Hypothyroidismication for the rest of their lives.

Herbal remedies toimprove thyroid function and relieve symptoms ofhypothyroidism include bladder wrack ( Fucus vesiculo-\nsus), which can be taken in capsule form or as a tea.\nSome foods, including cabbage, peaches, radishes, soy-beans, peanuts, and spinach, can interfere with the pro-duction of thyroid hormones.

    "content": "Hypotonic duodenography\nDefinition\nHypotonic duodenography is an x-ray procedure\nthat produces images of the duodenum. The duodenum isthe first part of the small intestine.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1758Hypotonic duodenographyPurpose\nHypotonic duodenography may be ordered to detect\ntumors of the head of the pancreas or the area where thepancreatic and bile ducts meet the small intestine.Lesions causing upper abdominal pain may be demon-\nstrated by duodenography, and the procedure can aid inthe diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis .\nPrecautions\nSome patients with narrowing of the tubes in the\nupper gastrointestinal tract should not receive duodenogra-phy. Patients with certain heart disorders and glaucoma\nare cautioned against receiving an agent called anticholin-ergic, which is administered during the procedure to lessenintestinal muscle spasms. A hormone called glucagon mayalso be used to relax the intestines, but its use is not rec-ommended in patients with most forms of diabetes.\nDescription\nHypotonic duodenography is also referred to as x ray\nof the duodenum or simply as duodenography. The patientis seated while the radiologist places a catheter in the noseand down into the stomach. Then the patient lies down andthe tube is continued to the duodenum. The radiologist isguided in this placement by a fluoroscopic image. (Fluoro-scopic equipment shows an immediate x ray. In this case,the x ray shows the location of the catheter as it is movedinto the stomach and duodenum.) Next, either the glucagonis administered intravenously or anticholinergic is injectedinto the patient to relax the muscles of the intestine.\nAfter several minutes, the physician will administer\nbarium through the catheter. Barium is a contrast agentthat will help highlight the area on the fluoroscopy screenand x rays. After a few films are taken, some of the bari-um is withdrawn and air is sent in through the catheter.Additional images are acquired and the catheter is thenremoved. The procedure takes from 30–60 minutes.\nPreparation\nPatients are required to fast from midnight before\nthe test until after the test, or about 6–12 hours. Just priorto the exam, patients should remove dentures, glasses,and other objects that may interfere with the procedure.The patient may be instructed to empty his or her bladderjust prior to duodenography.\nAftercare\nThe barium should be expelled within two to three\ndays. Extra fluids and/or an agent given by the physicianKEY TERMS\nAnticholinergic —A drug that lessens muscle\nspasms in the intestines, lungs, bladder, and eyemuscles.\nFluoroscopic (fluoroscopy) —An x-ray procedure\nthat produces immediate images and motion on ascreen. The images look like those seen at airportbaggage security stations.\nGlucagon —A hormone that changes glycogen, a\ncarbohydrate stored in muscles and the liver, intoglucose. It can be used to relax muscles for a pro-cedure such as duodenography.\nPancreas —A five-inch-long gland that lies behind\nthe stomach and next to the duodenum. The pan-creas releases glucagon, insulin and some of theenzymes which aid digestion. Pancreatitis is theswelling of the pancreas which can nausea, jaun-dice, and severe pain and may be fatal.\nto help encourage bowel movement may aid in barium\nelimination. Physicians and patients should watch forpossible reactions to the anticholinergic or glucagon. Ifan anticholinergic is used, patients are advised to emptytheir bladder within a few hours after the exam and towait two hours for clearing of vision or have someonedrive them home. Patients will notice that their stools arechalky white from the barium for one to three days fol-lowing the procedure.\nRisks\nAbdominal cramping may occur when the physi-\ncian instills air into the duodenum, but aside from thediscomfort, there are few risks associated with this pro-cedure. Side effects from the contrast, hormones oragents may occur. Those patients with diabetes, heartdisease, or glaucoma run the highest risk of reactionand should not receive anticholinergic or glucagon,depending on their specific conditions. Elderly patientsor those who are extremely ill, must be closely moni-tored during the procedure for possible return of fluid,or gastric reflux.\nNormal results\nThe linings of the duodenum and surrounding tis-\nsues will look smooth and even.

    "title": "Hysterectomy",
    "content": "Hysterectomy\nDefinition\nHysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. In a\ntotal hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. Insome cases, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are removedalong with the uterus (called hysterectomy with bilateralsalpingo-oophorectomy ). In a subtotal hysterectomy, only\nthe uterus is removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus,cervix, ovaries, oviducts, lymph nodes, and lymph channelsare removed. The type of hysterectomy performed dependson the reason for the procedure. In all cases, menstruationstops and a woman loses the ability to bear children.\nPurpose\nHysterectomy is the second most common operation\nperformed in the United States. About 556,000 of thesesurgeries are done annually. By age 60, approximatelyone out of every three American women will have had ahysterectomy. Yet it’s estimated that 30 percent of hys-terectomies are unnecessary.\nAbout 10% of hysterectomies are performed to treat\ncancer of the cervix, ovaries, or uterus. Women withcancer in one or more of these organs almost always\nhave the organ(s) removed as one part of their cancertreatment.\nThe most frequent reason for hysterectomy in the\nUnited States is to remove fibroid tumors, accountingfor 30% of these surgeries. Fibroid tumors are non-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus, which cancause pelvic and low back pain and heavy or lengthy\nmenstrual periods. They occur in 30–40% of womenover age 40, and are three times more likely to be pre-sent in African-American women than in Caucasianwomen. Fibroids do not need to be removed unlessthey are causing symptoms that interfere with awoman’s normal activities.\nTreatment of endometriosis is the reason for 20%\nof hysterectomies. The endometrium is the lining of theuterus. Endometriosis is a condition that occurs whenthe cells from the endometrium begin growing outsidethe uterus. The outlying endometrial cells respond to thehormones that control the menstrual cycle, bleedingeach month the way the lining of the uterus does. Thiscauses irritation of the surrounding tissue, leading topain and scarring.\nAnother 20% percent of hysterectomies are done\nbecause of heavy or abnormal vaginal bleeding that cannot be linked to any specific cause and cannot be con-trolled by other means. The remaining 20% of hysterec-tomies are performed to treat prolapsed uterus, pelvic\ninflammatory disease , and endometrial hyperplasia, a\npotentially precancerous condition.\nAlternatives\nThere are several alternatives to hysterectomy today.\nThey include:\nEmbolization\nUterine artery embolization is not a surgical proce-\ndure. Instead, interventional radiologists put a catherterinto the artery that leads to the uterus and injectpolyvinyl alcohol particles right where the artery leads tothe blood vessels that nourish the fibroids. By killing offthose blood vessels, the fibroids have no more blood sup-ply, and they die off. Severe cramping and pain after theprocedure is common, but serious complications are lessthan .5 percent and it may protect fertility.\nMyomectomy\nA myomectomy is a surgery used to remove\nfibroids, thus avoiding a hysterectomy. Hysteroscopicmyomectomy, in which a surgical “telescope,” orlaparascope, is inserted into the uterus through the vagina\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1760Hysterectomycan be done on an outpatient basis. If there are large\nfibroids, however, an abdominal incision is required.Then women typically are hospitalized for two to threedays, and require up to six weeks recovery. However,laparascopic myomectomies are also being done moreoften. They only require three small incisions in theabdomen, and have a much shorter hospitalization andrecovery time.\nOnce the fibroids have been removed, the surgeon\nmust repair the wall of the uterus to eliminate futurebleeding or infection.\nEndometrial ablation\nIn this surgical procedure, recommended for women\nwith small fibroids, the entire lining of the uterus isremoved. Women are no longer fertile, however. Theuterine cavity is filled with fluid and a hysteroscopy ,o r\ntelescope, inserted to provide a clear view of the uterus.Then the uterus is destroyed using a laser beam or elec-tric voltage. The procedure is typically done under anes-thesia, although women can go home the same day as thesurgery. Another, newer procedure involves using a bal-loon, which is filled with superheated liquid and inflateduntil it fills the uterus. The liquid kills the lining, andafter 8 minutes the balloon is removed.\nEndometrial resection\nLike endometrial ablation, the uterine lining is also\ndestroyed during this procedure, only instead of a laser,an electrosurgical wire loop is used.\nTotal hysterectomy\nA total hysterectomy, sometimes called a simple\nhysterectomy, removes the entire uterus and the cervix.The ovaries are not removed and continue to secrete hor-mones. Total hysterectomies are always performed in thecase of uterine and cervical cancer . This is the most\ncommon kind of hysterectomy.\nSometimes, in addition to a total hysterectomy a\nprocedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy isperformed. This surgery removes the ovaries and thefallopian tubes. Removal of the ovaries eliminates themain source of the hormone estrogen, so menopause\noccurs immediately. Removal of the ovaries and fal-lopian tubes is performed in about one-third of hys-terectomy operations, often to reduce the risk of ovar-\nian cancer .\nSubtotal hysterectomy\nIf the reason for the hysterectomy is to remove uter-\nine fibroids , treat abnormal bleeding, or relieve pelvic\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1761Hysterectomy\nTotal hysterectomy\nTotal hysterectomy with\nsalpingo-oophorectomySubtotal hysterectomyOvary\nUterus\nCervix\nVaginaFallopian tube\nThree types of hysterectomies: subtotal, total, and total with\nsalpingo-oophorectomy. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators\nGroup.)pain, it may be possible to remove only the uterus and\nleave the cervix. This procedure, called a subtotal hys-terectomy (or partial hysterectomy), removes the leastamount of tissue. The opening to the cervix is left inplace. Some women feel that leaving the cervix intactaids in their achieving sexual satisfaction. This proce-dure, which used to be rare, is now performed more fre-quently when requested.\nSubtotal hysterectomy is easier to perform than a\ntotal hysterectomy, but leaves a woman at risk for cervi-cal cancer. She will still need to get yearly pap smears.\nRadical hysterectomy\nRadical hysterectomies are performed on women\nwith cervical cancer or endometrial cancer that has\nspread to the cervix. A radical hysterectomy removes theuterus, cervix, top part of the vagina, ovaries, fallopiantubes, lymph nodes, lymph channels, and tissue in thepelvic cavity that surrounds the cervix. This type of hys-terectomy removes the most tissue and requires thelongest hospital stay and longer recovery period.\nPrecautions\nThe frequency with which hysterectomies are per-\nformed in the United States has been questioned inrecent years. It has been suggested that a large numberof hysterectomies are performed unnecessarily. TheUnited States has the highest rate of hysterectomies(number of hysterectomies per thousand women) of anycountry in the world. Also, the frequency of this surgeryvaries across different regions of the United States.Rates are highest in the South and Midwest, and arehigher for African American women. In recent years,although the number of hysterectomies performed hasdeclined, the number of hysterectomies performed onyounger women in their 30s and 40s is increasing, and55 percent of all hysterectomies are performed onwomen 35 to 49.\nWomen for whom a hysterectomy is recommended\nshould discuss possible alternatives with their doctor andconsider getting a second opinion, since this is majorsurgery with life-changing implications. Alternativetreatments exist for many conditions. Whether thesealternatives are appropriate for any individual woman isa decision she and her doctor should make together.\nAs in all major surgery, the health of the patient\naffects the risk of the operation. Women who have chron-ic heart or lung diseases, diabetes, or iron-deficiencyanemia may not be good candidates for this operation.Heavy smoking ,obesity , use of steroid drugs, and use of\nillicit drugs add to the surgical risk.Description\nThere are two ways that hysterectomies can be per-\nformed. The choice of method depends on the type ofhysterectomy, the doctor’s experience, and the reason forthe hysterectomy.\nAbdominal hysterectomy\nAbout 75% of hysterectomies performed in the\nUnited States are abdominal hysterectomies. The sur-geon makes a four to six inch incision either horizontallyacross the pubic hair line from hip bone to hip bone orvertically from navel to pubic bone. Horizontal incisionsleave a less noticeable scar, but vertical incisions give thesurgeon a better view of the abdominal cavity. The bloodvessels, fallopian tubes, and ligaments are cut away fromthe uterus, which is lifted out.\nAbdominal hysterectomies take from one to three\nhours. The hospital stay is three to five days, and it takesfour to eight weeks to return to normal activities.\nThe advantages of an abdominal hysterectomy are\nthat the uterus can be removed even if a woman has inter-nal scarring (adhesions) from previous surgery or herfibroids are large. The surgeon has a good view of theabdominal cavity and more room to work. Also, surgeonshave the most experience with this type of hysterectomy.The abdominal incision is more painful than with vaginalhysterectomy and the recovery period is longer.\nV aginal hysterectomy\nWith a vaginal hysterectomy, the surgeon makes an\nincision near the top of the vagina. The surgeon thenreaches through this incision to cut and tie off the liga-ments, blood vessels, and fallopian tubes. Once theuterus is cut free, it is removed through the vagina. Theoperation takes one to two hours. The hospital stay isusually one to three days, and return to normal activitiestakes about four weeks.\nThe advantages of this procedure are that it leaves\nno visible scar and is less painful. The disadvantage isthat it is more difficult for the surgeon to see the uterusand surrounding tissue. This makes complications morecommon. Large fibroids cannot be removed using thistechnique. It is very difficult to remove the ovaries dur-ing a vaginal hysterectomy, so this approach may not bepossible if the ovaries are involved.\nVaginal hysterectomy can also be performed using a\nlaparoscopic technique. With this surgery, a tube contain-ing a tiny camera is inserted through an incision in thenavel. This allows the surgeon to see the uterus on avideo monitor. The surgeon then inserts two slenderinstruments through small incisions in the abdomen and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1762Hysterectomyuses them to cut and tie off the blood vessels, fallopian\ntubes, and ligaments. When the uterus is detached, it isremoved though a small incision at the top of the vagina.\nThis technique, called laparoscopic-assisted vaginal\nhysterectomy, allows surgeons to perform a vaginal hys-terectomy that might be too difficult otherwise. The hos-pital stay is usually only one day. Recovery time is abouttwo weeks. The disadvantage is that this operation is rel-atively new and requires great skill by the surgeon.\nAny vaginal hysterectomy may have to be converted\nto an abdominal hysterectomy during surgery if compli-cations develop.\nPreparation\nBefore surgery the doctor will order blood and urine\ntests. The woman may also meet with the anesthesiolo-gist to evaluate any special conditions that might affectthe administration of anesthesia. On the evening beforethe operation, the woman should eat a light dinner andthen avoid eating or drinking anything.\nAftercare\nAfter surgery a woman will feel pain. The degree of\ndiscomfort varies, and is generally greatest in abdominalhysterectomies because of the incision. Hospital staysvary from about two days (laparoscopic-assisted vaginalhysterectomy) to five or six days (abdominal hysterec-tomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Duringthe hospital stay, the doctor will probably order moreblood tests.\nReturn to normal activities such as driving and\nworking takes anywhere from two to eight weeks, againdepending on the type of surgery.

Theseinclude unanticipated reaction to anesthesia, internalbleeding, blood clots, damage to other organs such asthe bladder, and post-surgery infection. The risk ofdeath is about one in every 1,000 (1/1,000) women\nhaving the operation.\nOther complications sometimes reported after a hys-\nterectomy include changes in sex drive, weight gain,constipation , and pelvic pain.

In modern psychology and psychiatry,hysteria is a feature of hysterical disorders in which apatient experiences physical symptoms that have a psy-chological, rather than an organic, cause; and histrionicpersonality disorder characterized by excessive emo-tions, dramatics, and attention-seeking behavior.\nDescription\nHysterical disorders\nPatients with hysterical disorders, such as conver-\nsion and somatization disorder experience physicalsymptoms that have no organic cause. Conversion disor-der affects motor and sensory functions, while somatiza-tion affects the gastrointestinal, nervous, cardiopul-monary, or reproductive systems. These patients are not“faking” their ailments, as the symptoms are very real tothem. Disorders with hysteric features typically begin inadolescence or early adulthood.\nHistrionic personality disorder\nHistrionic personality disorder has a prevalence of\napproximately 2–3% of the general population. It begins inearly adulthood and has been diagnosed more frequently inwomen than in men. Histrionic personalities are typicallyself-centered and attention seeking. They operate on emo-tion, rather than fact or logic, and their conversation is fullof generalizations and dramatic appeals. While the patient’senthusiasm, flirtatious behavior, and trusting nature maymake them appear charming, their need for immediate grat-ification, mercurial displays of emotion, and constantdemand for attention often alienates them from others.\nCauses and symptoms\nHysterical disorders\nHysteria may be a defense mechanism to avoid\npainful emotions by unconsciously transferring this dis-tress to the body. There may be a symbolic function forthis, for example a rape victim may develop paralyzedlegs. Symptoms may mimic a number of physical andneurological disorders which must be ruled out before adiagnosis of hysteria is made.\nHistrionic personality disorder\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ), individu-als with histrionic personality possess at least five of the\nfollowing symptoms or personality features:\n• a need to be the center of attention\n• inappropriate, sexually seductive, or provocative behav-\nior while interacting with others\n• rapidly changing emotions and superficial expression\nof emotions\n• vague and impressionistic speech (gives opinions with-\nout any supporting details)\n• easily influenced by others• believes relationships are more intimate than they are\nDiagnosis\nHysterical disorders frequently prove to be actual\nmedical or neurological disorders,which makes it impor-tant to rule these disorders out before diagnosing a patientwith hysterical disorders. In addition to a patient inter-view, several clinical inventories may be used to assessthe patient for hysterical tendencies, such as the Minneso-ta Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 ( MMPI-2 ) or the\nMillon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III).These tests may be administered in an outpatient or hospi-tal setting by a psychiatrist or psychologist.\nTreatment\nHysterical disorders\nFor people with hysterical disorders, a supportive\nhealthcare environment is critical. Regular appointmentswith a physician who acknowledges the patient’s physi-cal discomfort are important. Psychotherapy may beattempted to help the patient gain insight into the causeof their distress. Use of behavioral therapy can help toavoid reinforcing symptoms.\nHistrionic personality disorder\nPsychotherapy is generally the treatment of choice\nfor histrionic personality disorder. It focuses on support-ing the patient and on helping develop the skills neededto create meaningful relationships with others.\nPrognosis\nHysterical disorders\nThe outcome for hysterical disorders varies by type.\nSomatization is typically a lifelong disorder, while con-version disorder may last for months or years. Symptomsof hysterical disorders may suddenly disappear, only toreappear in another form later.\nHistrionic personality disorder\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder may be\nat a higher risk for suicidal gestures, attempts, or threats in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1764Hysteriaan effort to gain attention.

Paralysis,blindness, anesthesia (lack of feeling), coordina-tion or balance problems, and seizures are allcommon symptoms of the disorder.\nSomatization disorder —The appearance of physi-\ncal symptoms in the gastrointestinal system, thenervous system, the cardiopulmonary system, orthe reproductive system that have no organic cause.injected. Hystero means uterus and salpingo means\ntubes, so hysterosalpingography literally means to takepictures of the uterus and fallopian tubes. This proceduremay also be called hysterography (or HSG).\nPurpose\nHysterosalpingography is used to determine if the fal-\nlopian tubes are open, or if there are any apparent abnormal-ities or defects in the uterus. It can be used to detect tumors,scar tissue, or tears in the lining of the uterus. This proce-dure is often used to help diagnose infertility in women.\nThe fallopian tubes are the location where an egg from theovary joins with sperm to produce a fertilized ovum. If thefallopian tubes are blocked or deformed, the egg may not beable to descend or the sperm may be blocked from movingup to meet the egg. Up to 30% of all cases of infertility aredue to damaged or blocked fallopian tubes.\nPrecautions\nThis procedure should not be done on women who\nsuspect they might be pregnant or who may have a pelvicinfection. Women who have had an allergic reaction todye used in previous x-ray procedures should informtheir doctor.\nDescription\nAs with other types of pelvic examinations, the\nwoman will lie on her back on an examination table withher legs sometimes raised in stirrups. The x-ray equip-ment is placed above the abdomen.\nA speculum is inserted into the vagina and a catheter\n(a thin tube) is inserted into the uterus through the cervix(the opening to the uterus). A small balloon in thecatheter is inflated to hold it in place. A liquid water-based or oil-based dye is then injected through thecatheter into the uterus. This process can cause cramp-ing,pain , and uterine spasms.\nAs the dye spreads through the reproductive tract,\nthe doctor may watch for blockages or abnormalities onan x-ray monitor. Several x rays will also be taken. Theprocedure takes approximately 15–30 minutes. The xrays will be developed while the patient waits, but thefinal reading and interpretation of the x rays by a radiolo-gist (a doctor who specializes in x rays) may not be avail-able for a few days.\nInterestingly, sometimes the hysterosalpingography\nprocedure itself can be considered a treatment. The dyeused can sometimes open up small blockages in the fal-lopian tubes. The need for additional test procedures orsurgical treatments to deal with infertility should be dis-cussed with the doctor.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1765HysterosalpingographyKEY TERMS\nCatheter —A thin tube, usually made of plastic,\nthat is inserted into the body to allow the passageof fluid into or out of a site.\nFallopian tubes —The narrow ducts leading from a\nwoman’s ovaries to the uterus.

General anesthesia isnot needed. A pain reliever may be taken prior to the pro-cedure to lessen the severity of cramping.\nAftercare\nWhile no special aftercare is required after a hysteros-\nalpingography, the woman may be observed for some peri-od after the procedure to ensure that she does not have anyallergic reactions to the dye. A sanitary napkin may be wornafter the procedure to absorb dye that will flow out throughthe vaginal opening. If a blockage is seen in a tube, thepatient may be given an antibiotic. A woman should notifyher doctor if she experiences excessive bleeding, extensivepelvic pain, fever , or an unpleasant vaginal odor after the\nprocedure. These symptoms may indicate a pelvic infection.Counseling may be necessary to interpret the results of the xrays, and to discuss any additional procedures to treat tubalblockages or uterine abnormalities found.\nRisks\nCramps during the procedure are common. Compli-\ncations associated with hysterosalpingography includeabdominal pain, pelvic infection, and allergic reactions.It is also possible that abnormalities of the fallopian\ntubes and uterus will not be detected by this procedure.\nNormal results\nA normal hysterosalpingography will show a healthy,\nnormally shaped uterus and unblocked fallopian tubes.\nAbnormal results\nBlockage of one or both of the fallopian tubes or\nabnormalities of the uterus may be detected.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie A.

(Photo\nResearchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)Hysteroscopy\nDefinition\nHysteroscopy is a procedure that allows a physician\nto look through the vagina and neck of the uterus (cervix)to inspect the cavity of the uterus. A telescope-likeinstrument called a hysteroscope is used. Hysteroscopyis used as both a diagnostic and a treatment tool.\nPurpose\nDiagnostic hysteroscopy may be used to evaluate the\ncause of infertility , to determine the cause of repeated\nmiscarriages, or to help locate polyps and fibroids.\nThe procedure is also used to treat gynecological\nconditions, often instead of or in addition to dilatation\nand curettage (D&C). A D&C is a procedure for scrap-\ning the lining of the uterus. A D&C can be used to take asample of the lining of the uterus for analysis. Hys-teroscopy is an advance over D&C because the doctorcan take tissue samples of specific areas or actually seefibroids, polyps, or structural abnormalities.\nWhen used for treatment, the hysteroscope is used\nwith other devices to remove polyps, fibroids, or IUDsthat have become embedded in the wall of the uterus.\nPrecautions\nThe procedure is not performed on women with cer-\nvical cancer ,endometrial cancer , or acute pelvic\ninflammation.\nDescription\nDiagnostic hysteroscopy is performed in either a\ndoctor’s office or hospital. Before inserting the hystero-scope, the doctor injects a local anesthetic around thecervix. Once it has taken effect, the doctor dilates thecervix and then inserts a narrow lighted tube (the hys-teroscope) through the cervix to reveal the inside of theuterus. Ordinarily, the walls of the uterus are touchingeach other. In order to get a better view, the uterus isinflated with carbon dioxide gas or fluid. Hysteroscopytakes about 30 minutes, and can cost anywhere from$750 to $4,000 depending on the extent of the procedure.\nTreatment involving the use of hysteroscopy is usu-\nally performed as a day surgical procedure with regionalor general anesthesia. Tiny surgical instruments areinserted through the hysteroscope, and are used toremove polyps or fibroids. A small sample of tissue lin-ing the uterus is often removed for examination, espe-cially if there is any abnormal bleeding.Preparation\nIf the procedure is done in the doctor’s office, the\npatient will be given a mild pain reliever before the pro-\ncedure to ease cramping. The doctor will wash the vaginaand cervix with an antiseptic solution.\nIf the procedure is done in the hospital under general\nanesthesia, the patient should not eat or drink anything (noteven water) after midnight the night before the procedure.\nAftercare\nMany women experience light bleeding for several\ndays after surgical hysteroscopy. Mild cramping or painis common after operative hysteroscopy, but usuallyfades away within eight hours. If carbon dioxide gas wasused, there may also be some shoulder pain. Nonpre-scription pain relievers may help ease discomfort.Women may want to take the day off and relax after hav-ing hysteroscopy.\nRisks\nDiagnostic hysteroscopy is a fairly safe procedure\nthat only rarely causes complications. The primary risk isprolonged bleeding or infection, usually following surgi-cal hysteroscopy to remove a growth.\nVery rare complications include perforation of the\nuterus, bowel, or bladder. Surgery under general anesthe-sia causes the additional risks typically associated withanesthesia.\nPatients should alert their health care provider if\nthey develop any of these symptoms:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1767Hysteroscopy\nBladder\nFibroidsUterus\nRectumHysteroscope\nHysteroscopy is a procedure that allows inspection of the\nuterus by using a telescope-like instrument called a hys-teroscope.

    "content": "Ichthyosis\nDefinition\nDerived from the Greek word meaning fish disease,\nichthyosis is a congenital (meaning present at birth) der-matological (skin) disease that is represented by thick,scaly skin.\nDescription\nThe ichthyoses are a group of genetic skin diseases\ncaused by an abnormality in skin growth that results in dry-ing and scaling. There are at least 20 types of ichthyosis.Ichthyosis can be more or less severe, sometimes accumu-lating thick scales and cracks that are painful and bleed.Ichthyosis is not contagious because it is inherited.\nThe most common form of ichthyosis is called\nichthyosis vulgaris ( vulgar is Latin for common), and\noccurs in approximately one person in every 250 and isinherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The mostrare types of ichthyosis occur in fewer than one personin one million and are inherited in an autosomal reces-sive manner. Ichthyosis occurs regardless of the part ofthe world the child is from, or the ethnic background ofthe parents.\nCauses and symptoms\nDepending on the specific type of ichthyosis, the\ninheritance can be autosomal recessive, autosomaldominant, X-linked recessive, X-linked dominant, orsporadic. Autosomal recessive means that the alteredgene for the disease or trait is located on one of thefirst 22 pairs of chromosomes, which are also called“autosomes.” Males and females are equally likely tohave an autosomal recessive disease or trait. Recessivemeans that two copies of the altered gene are neces-sary to express the condition. Therefore, a child inher-its one copy of the altered gene from each parent, whoare called carriers (because they have only one copy ofthe altered gene). Since carriers do not express thealtered gene, parents usually do not know they carrythe altered gene that causes ichthyosis until they havean affected child. Carrier parents have a 1-in-4 chance(or 25%) with each pregnancy , to have a child with\nichthyosis.\nAutosomal dominant inheritance also means that\nboth males and females are equally likely to have thedisease but only one copy of the altered gene is neces-sary to have the condition. An individual withichthyosis has a 50/50 chance to pass the condition tohis or her child.\nThe skin is made up of several layers, supported\nunderneath by a layer of fat that is thicker or thinnerdepending on location. The lower layers contain bloodvessels, the middle layers contain actively growing cells,and the upper layer consists of dead cells that serve as abarrier to the outside world. This barrier is nearly water-proof and highly resistant to infection. Scatteredthroughout the middle layers are hair follicles, oil andsweat glands, and nerve endings. The upper layer is con-stantly flaking off and being replaced from beneath bynew tissue. In ichthyosis, the skin’s natural sheddingprocess is slowed or inhibited; and in some types, skincells are produced too rapidly.\nThe abnormality in skin growth and hydration called\nichthyosis may present with symptoms at birth or in earlychildhood. Ichthyosis can itch relentlessly, leading tosuch complications of scratching as lichen simplex ( der-\nmatitis characterized by raw patches of skin). Either the\ncracking or the scratching can introduce infection, bring-ing with it discomfort and complications.I\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1771Diagnosis\nA dermatologist will often make the diagnosis of\nichthyosis, based on a clinical exam. However, a skin\nbiopsy , or DNA study (from a small blood sample) is\nnecessary to confirm the diagnosis. Evaluation for asso-ciated problems is done by a complete physical medicalexamination.\nFor some types of ichythyosis, the abnormal gene\nhas been identified and prenatal testing is available. Atpresent this is true for the autosomal recessive congenitalichythoses, which include: lamellar ichthyosis (LI), auto-somal recessive lamellar ichthyosis (ARLI), congenitalichthyosiform erythroderm a(CIE), and non-bullous con-genital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE).\nThere are four different genes that have been located\nfor the autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses; howev-er, testing is available for only one gene called transgluta-minase-1 (TGM1) located on chromosome 14. Once acouple has had a child with ichthyosis, and they have hadthe genetic cause identified by DNA studies (performedfrom a small blood sample), prenatal testing for futurepregnancies may be considered.

CVS is a biop-\nsy of the placenta performed in the first trimester of preg-nancy under ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound is the use ofsound waves to visualize the developing fetus. The genet-ic makeup of the placenta is identical to the fetus andtherefore the TGM1 gene can be studied from this tissue.There is approximately a one in 100 chance for miscar-\nriage with CVS. Amniocentesis is a procedure done\nunder ultrasound guidance in which a long thin needle isinserted through the mother’s abdomen into the uterus, towithdraw a couple of tablespoons of amniotic fluid (fluidsurrounding the developing baby) to study. The TGM1gene can be studied using cells from the amniotic fluid.Other genetic tests, such as a chromosome analysis, mayalso be performed through either CVS or amniocentesis.\nTreatment\nMost treatments for ichthyosis are topical, which\nmeans they are applied directly to the skin, not takeninternally. Some forms of ichthyosis require two forms oftreatment—a reduction in the amount of scale buildupand moisturizing of the underlying skin. Several agentsare available for each purpose. Reduction in the amountof scale is achieved by keratolytics. Among this class ofdrugs are urea, lactic acid, and salicylic acid. Petrolatum,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1772Ichthyosis60% propylene glycol, and glycerin are successful mois-\nturizing agents, as are many commercially availableproducts. Increased humidity of the ambient air is alsohelpful in preventing skin dryness.\nBecause the skin acts as a barrier to the outside envi-\nronment, medicines have a hard time penetrating, espe-cially through the thick skin of the palms of the handsand the soles of the feet. This resistance is diminishedgreatly by maceration (softening the skin). Soakinghands in water macerates skin so that it looks like pruneskin. Occlusion (covering) with rubber gloves or plasticwrap will also macerate skin. Applying medicines andthen covering the skin with an occlusive dressing willfacilitate entrance of the medicine and greatly magnifyits effect.\nSecondary treatments are necessary to control pruri-\ntus (itching ) and infection. Commercial products con-\ntaining camphor, menthol, eucalyptus oil, aloe, and simi-lar substances are very effective as antipruritics. If theskin cracks deeply enough, a pathway for infection iscreated. Topical antibiotics like bacitracin are effective\nin prevention and in the early stages of these skin infec-tions. Cleansing with hydrogen peroxide inhibits infec-tion as well.\nFinally, there are topical and internal derivatives of\nvitamin A called retinoids, that improve skin growth andare used for severe cases of acne , ichthyosis, and other\nskin conditions.\nPrognosis\nThis condition requires continuous care throughout\na lifetime. Properly treated, in most cases it is a cosmeticproblem. There are a small number of lethal forms, suchas harlequin fetus.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSybert, Virginia P. Genetic Skin Disorders.

They range from mild conditions that respondwell to treatment, to progressive, nonresponsive dis-ease states that severely limit lung function and maycause death .\nDescription\nThe body produces inflammatory cells in response\nto a variety of conditions, including a number of differentdiseases, pollutants, certain infections, exposure toorganic dust or toxic fumes and vapors, and variousdrugs and poisons. When white blood cells and tissuefluid rich in protein collect in the small air sacs of thelungs, or alveoli, the sacs become inflamed (alveolitis).In time, the fluid may solidify and cause scar formationthat replaces the normal lung tissue. This process isknown as pulmonary fibrosis . In about half of all\npatients, no specific cause is ever found; they are said tohave idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1773Idiopathic infiltrative lung diseasesSome patients have special types of interstitial lung\ndisease that may occur in certain types of patients, or fea-ture typical pathological changes when a sample of lungtissue is examined under a microscope. They include:\n• Usual interstitial pneumonitis. Disease occurs in a\npatchy form throughout the lungs. Parts of the lungscan appear normal while others have dense scar tissueand lung cysts, often the end result of pulmonary fibro-sis. This disease progresses quite slowly. Both childrenand adults may be affected.\n• Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis. Similar-appear-\ning lesions are present throughout the lungs. Bothinflammatory cells and cells that have separated fromthe air sac linings (desquamated) are present. Someresearchers believe this is an early form of usual inter-stitial pneumonitis.\n• Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. Most of the cells\ninfiltrating the lungs are the type of white blood cellscalled lymphocytes. Both the breathing tubes (bronchi)and blood vessels of the lungs become thickened. Inchildren, this condition tends to occur when theimmune system is not operating properly, as occurswith Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nCauses and symptoms\nBy definition, the causes of idiopathic infiltrative\nlung diseases are not known. Some forms of pulmonaryfibrosis, however, do have specific causes and these mayprovide a clue as to what may cause idiopathic diseases.Known causes of pulmonary fibrosis include diseasesthat impair the body’s immune function; infection byviruses and the bacterium causing tuberculosis ; and\nexposure to such mineral dusts as silica or asbestos, orsuch organic materials as bird droppings. Other cases ofpulmonary fibrosis result from exposure to fumes andvapors, radiation (in industry or medically), and certaindrugs used to treat disease.\nPatients with interstitial lung disease usually have\nlabored breathing when exerting themselves. Often theycough and feel overly tired (“no stamina”). Wheezing is\nuncommon. When the physician listens to the patient’schest with a stethoscope, dry, crackling sounds may beheard. Some patients have vague chest pain . When dis-\nease progresses, the patient may breathe very rapidly,have mottled blue skin (because of getting too little oxy-gen), and lose weight. The fingertips may appear thick orclub-shaped.\nDiagnosis\nBoth scars in the lung and cysts (air-filled spaces)\ncan be seen on a chest x ray . Up to 10% of patients,however, may have normal x rays even if their symptoms\nare severe. A special type of x ray, high-resolution com-puted tomography scan (CT scan), often is helpful inadult patients. Tests of lung function will show that thelungs cannot hold enough air with each breath, and thereis too little oxygen in the blood, especially after exercis-ing. In a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage, a tubeis placed through the nose and windpipe into the bronchiand a small amount of saline is released and then with-drawn. This fluid can then be analyzed for cells. A tinypiece of lung tissue can be sampled using the sameinstrument. If necessary, a larger sample (a biopsy) istaken through an incision in the chest wall and examinedunder a microscope.\nTreatment\nThe first medication given, providing scarring is\nnot too extensive, is usually a steroid drug such asprednisone. An occasional patient will improve dra-matically if steroid therapy stops the inflammation.Most patients, however, improve to a limited extent. Itmay take 6–12 weeks for a patient to begin to respond.Patients must be watched closely for a gain in bodyweight, high blood pressure, and depression. Steroidscan also result in diabetes, ulcer disease, and cataract.Patients treated with steroids are at risk of contractingserious infection. If steroids have not proved effectiveor have caused serious side effects, other anti-inflam-matory drugs, such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) orazathioprine (Imuran), can be tried. Cytoxan some-times is combined with a steroid, but it carries its ownrisks, which include bladder inflammation and sup-pression of the bone marrow. Some patients will bene-fit from a bronchodilator drug that relaxes the airwayand makes breathing easier.\nSome patients with interstitial lung disease, espe-\ncially children, will need oxygen therapy. Usually oxy-gen is given during sleep or exercise , but if the blood\noxygen level is very low it may be given constantly. Aprogram of conditioning, training in how to breathe effi-ciently, energy-saving tips, and a proper diet will helppatients achieve the highest possible level of functiongiven the state of their illness. All patients should be vac-cinated each year against influenza . A last resort for\nthose with very advanced disease who do not respond tomedication is lung transplantation . This operation is\nbeing done more widely, and it is even possible toreplace both lungs.\nPrognosis\nA scoring system based on lung function and x ray\nappearances has been designed to help monitor a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1774Idiopathic infiltrative lung diseasespatient’s course. In general, idiopathic forms of intersti-\ntial lung disease cause a good deal of illness, and a sig-nificant number of deaths. A majority of patients getworse over time, although survival for many years iscertainly possible. An estimated one in five affectedchildren fail to survive. In different series, survivaltimes average between four and ten years. Early diag-nosis gives the best chance of a patient recovering or atleast stabilizing. Once the lungs are badly scarred,nothing short of lung transplantation offers hope ofrestoring lung function. Patients with desquamativeinterstitial pneumonitis tend to respond well to steroidtreatment, and live longer than those with other types ofinfiltrative lung disease.\nPrevention\nSince we do not understand what causes idiopathic\ninterstitial lung diseases, there is no way to prevent them.What can be done is to prevent extensive scarring of thelungs by making the diagnosis shortly after the firstsymptoms develop, and trying steroids or other drugs inhope of suppressing lung inflammation.

It canoccur at any age, but the great majority of patients are16–35 when diagnosed. Males seem to be affected moreoften than females, and whites are more often affectedthan blacks. Blood in the urine (hematuria), either indi-cated by a visible change in the color of the urine ordetected by laboratory testing, is a hallmark of this syn-drome, and it may occur continuously or sporadically.The pattern of occurrence is not indicative of the severi-ty of kidney damage.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe glomeruli are the kidney structures that filter\nthe blood and extract waste, which is then excreted asurine. The barrier between the blood and the urine sideof the filter mechanism is a membrane only one celllayer thick. Anything that damages the membrane will\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1775Idiopathic primary renal hematuric/proteinuric syndromeresult in hematuria. Symptoms of idiopathic primary\nrenal hematruic/proteinuric syndrome are caused byinflammation of the glomeruli and deposit of IgA anti-bodies in kidney tissue. Although a genetic basis forthis syndrome is suspected, this has not been proven.Symptoms often appear 24–48 hours after an upper res-piratory or gastrointestinal infection. Symptoms of thesyndrome include:\n• blood in the urine (hematuria)\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)\n• pain in the lower back or kidney area\n• elevated blood pressure (20–30% of cases)\n• nephrotic syndrome (less than 10% of cases)\n• swelling (occasionally)\nThis condition usually does not get worse with time,\nalthough renal failure occasionally results. In patientswith large amounts of IgA deposits in their glomeruli,the long-term prognosis may not be favorable. The syn-drome can go into remission spontaneously, althoughthis is more common in children than in adults.\nDiagnosis\nOne of the objectives of diagnosis is to distinguish\nglomerular from non-glomerular kidney diseases. Idio-pathic primary hematuric/proteinuric syndromeinvolves the glomeruli. The presence of fragmented ordistorted red blood cells in the urine is evidence ofglomerular disease. A high concentration of protein inthe urine is also evidence for glomerular disease. Thehematuria associated with this syndrome must be dis-tinguished from that caused by urinary tract diseases,which can also cause a loss of blood into the urine.KEY TERMS\nGlomeruli (singular, glomerulus) —Filtering struc-\ntures in the kidneys.\nHematuria —The presence of hemoglobin or red\nblood cells in the urine.\nIdiopathic —Refers to a disease that arises from an\nobscure or unknown cause.\nNephrotic syndrome —A kidney disorder charac-\nterized by fluid retention (edema) and proteinuria.It is caused by damage to the kidney glomeruli.\nProteinuria —The presence of protein in the urine\nexceeding normal levels.Biopsy of the patient’s kidney shows deposits of IgA\nantibodies. Detecting IgA-antibody deposits rules outthin membrane disease as the cause of the hematuriaand proteinuria. Test values are normal for ASO, com-plement, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies,anti-DNase, and cryoglobulins, all of which are associ-ated with different types of kidney disease. A diagnosisof idiopathic primary renal hematuric/proteinuric syn-drome is largely made by ruling out other diseases andtheir causes, leaving this syndrome as the remainingpossible diagnosis.\nTreatment\nMany patients do not need specific treatment, except\nfor those who have symptoms indicating a poor progno-sis. Oral doses of corticosteroids are effective in patients\nwith mild proteinuria and good kidney function. Othertreatments, such as medications to lower blood pressure,are aimed at slowing or preventing kidney damage. Ifkidney failure develops, dialysis or kidney transplanta-\ntion is necessary.\nPrognosis\nIdiopathic primary renal hematuric/proteinuric syn-\ndrome progresses slowly and in many cases does notprogress at all. Risk for progression of the disorder isconsidered higher if there is:\n• high blood pressure\n• large amounts of protein in the urine• increased levels of urea and creatinine in the blood\n(indications of kidney function)\nAbout 25–35% of patients may develop kidney fail-\nure within about 25 years.\nPrevention\nSince the underlying causes of this syndrome are so\npoorly understood, there is no known prevention.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrenner, B.

Lohr, PhD\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic\npurpura\nDefinition\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP, is a\nbleeding disorder caused by an abnormally low level ofplatelets in the patient’s blood. Platelets are small plate-shaped bodies in the blood that combine to form a plugwhen a blood vessel is injured. The platelet plug thenbinds certain proteins in the blood to form a clot thatstops bleeding. ITP’s name describes its cause and twosymptoms. Idiopathic means that the disorder has noapparent cause. ITP is now often called immune throm-bocytopenic purpura rather than idiopathic because ofrecent findings that ITP patients have autoimmune anti-bodies in their blood. Thrombocytopenia is another\nword for a decreased number of blood platelets. Purpurarefers to a purplish or reddish-brown skin rash caused bythe leakage of blood from broken capillaries into theskin. Other names for ITP include purpura hemorrhagicaand essential thrombocytopenia.\nDescription\nITP may be either acute or chronic. The acute form\nis most common in children between the ages of two andsix years; the chronic form is most common in adultfemales between 20 and 40. Between 10% and 20% ofchildren with ITP have the chronic form. ITP does notappear to be related to race, lifestyle, climate, or environ-mental factors.\nITP is a disorder that affects the overall number of\nblood platelets rather than their function. The normalplatelet level in adults is between 150,000 and450,000/mm3. Platelet counts below 50,000 mm3 increasethe risk of dangerous bleeding from trauma; counts below20,000/mm3 increase the risk of spontaneous bleeding.\nCauses and Symptoms\nIn adults, ITP is considered an autoimmune disorder,\nwhich means that the body produces antibodies that dam-age some of its own products—in this case, bloodplatelets. Some adults with chronic ITP also have otherimmune system disorders, such as systemic lupus ery-thematosus (SLE). In children, ITP is usually triggered\nby a virus infection, most often rubella ,chickenpox ,\nmeasles , cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus. It usu-\nally begins about two or three weeks after the infection.\nAcute ITP\nAcute ITP is characterized by bleeding into the skin\nor from the nose, mouth, digestive tract, or urinary tract.The onset is usually sudden. Bleeding into the skin takesthe form of purpura or petechiae. Purpura is a purplish orreddish-brown rash or discoloration of the skin; petechi-ae are small round pinpoint hemorrhages. Both arecaused by the leakage of blood from tiny capillariesunder the skin surface. In addition to purpura andpetechiae, the patient may notice that he or she bruises\nmore easily than usual. In extreme cases, patients withITP may bleed into the lungs, brain, or other vital organs.\nChronic ITP\nChronic ITP has a gradual onset and may have mini-\nmal or no external symptoms. The low platelet count\nmay be discovered in the course of a routine blood test.Most patients with chronic ITP, however, will consulttheir primary care doctor because of the purpuric skinrash, nosebleeds, or bleeding from the digestive or uri-nary tract. Women sometimes go to their gynecologistfor unusually heavy or lengthy menstrual periods.\nThe risk factors for the development of chronic ITP\ninclude:\n• female sex\n• age over 10 years at onset of symptoms\n• slow onset of bruising\n• presence of other autoantibodies in the blood\nDiagnosis\nITP is usually considered a diagnosis of exclusion,\nwhich means that the doctor arrives at the diagnosis by aprocess of ruling out other possible causes. If the patientbelongs to one or more of the risk groups for chronic ITP,the doctor may order a blood test for autoantibodies inthe blood early in the diagnostic process.\nPhysical examination\nIf the doctor suspects ITP, he or she will examine the\npatient’s skin for bruises, purpuric areas, or petechiae. Ifthe patient has had nosebleeds or bleeding from themouth or other parts of the body, the doctor will examinethese areas for other possible causes of bleeding. Patientswith ITP usually look and feel healthy except for thebleeding.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1777Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpuraThe most important features that the doctor will be\nlooking for during the physical examination are the con-\ndition of the patient’s spleen and the presence of fever .\nPatients with ITP do not have fever whereas patients withlupus and some other types of thrombocytopenia are usu-ally feverish. The doctor will have the patient lie flat onthe examining table in order to feel the size of the spleen.If the spleen is noticeably enlarged, ITP is not absolutelyruled out but is a less likely diagnosis.\nLaboratory testing\nThe doctor will order a complete blood count\n(CBC), a test of clotting time, a bone marrow test, and atest for antiplatelet antibodies if it is available in the hos-pital laboratory. Patients with ITP usually have plateletcounts below 20,000/mm\n3and prolonged bleeding time .\nThe size and appearance of the platelets may be abnor-mal. The red blood cell count (RBC) and white blood cellcount (WBC) are usually normal, although about 10% ofpatients with ITP are also anemic.

Detection of antiplatelet antibodies\nin the blood is considered to confirm the diagnosis of ITP.\nTreatment\nGeneral care and monitoring\nThere is no specific treatment for ITP. In most cases,\nthe disorder will resolve without medications or surgerywithin two to six weeks. Nosebleeds can be treated withice packs when necessary.\nGeneral care includes explaining ITP to the patient\nand advising him or her to watch for bruising, petechiae, orother signs of recurrence. Children should be discouragedfrom rough contact sports or other activities that increasethe risk of trauma. Patients are also advised to avoid usingaspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) as pain relievers\nbecause these drugs lengthen the clotting time of blood.\nEmergency treatment\nPatients with acute ITP who are losing large\namounts of blood or bleeding into their central nervoussystem require emergency treatment. This includes trans-fusions of platelets, intravenous immunoglobulins, orprednisone. Prednisone is a steroid medication thatdecreases the effects of antibody on platelets and eventu-ally lowers antibody production. If the patient has a his-tory of ITP that has not responded to prednisone orimmunoglobulins, the surgeon may remove the patient’sspleen. This operation is called a splenectomy . The rea-\nson for removing the spleen when ITP does not respondto other forms of treatment is that the spleen sometimeskeeps platelets out of the general blood circulation.\nMedications and transfusions\nPatients with chronic ITP can be treated with pred-\nnisone, immune globulin, or large doses of intravenousgamma globulin. Although 90% of patients respond toimmunoglobulin treatment, it is very expensive. About80% of patients respond to prednisone therapy. Platelettransfusions are not recommended for routine treatmentof ITP. If the patient’s platelet level does not improvewithin one to four months, or requires high doses ofprednisone, the doctor may recommend splenectomy. Allmedications for ITP are given either orally or intra-venously; intramuscular injection is avoided because ofthe possibility of causing bleeding into the skin.\nSurgery\nBetween 80% and 85% of adults with ITP have a\nremission of the disorder after the spleen is removed.Splenectomy is usually avoided in children younger thanfive years because of the increased risk of a severe infec-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1778Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpuration after the operation. In older children, however,\nsplenectomy is recommended if the child has been treat-ed for 12 months without improvement; if the ITP is verysevere or the patient is getting worse; if the patient beginsto bleed into the head or brain; and if the patient is anadolescent female with extremely heavy periods.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from acute ITP is good;\n80% of patients recover without special treatment. Theprognosis for chronic ITP is also good; most patientsexperience long-term remissions.

    "title": "Ileus",
    "content": "Ileus\nDefinition\nIleus is a partial or complete non-mechanical block-\nage of the small and/or large intestine.Description\nThere are two types of intestinal obstructions ,\nmechanical and non-mechanical. Mechanical obstruc-tions occur because the bowel is physically blocked andits contents can not pass the point of the obstruction. Thishappens when the bowel twists on itself (volvulus) or asthe result of hernias, impacted feces, abnormal tissuegrowth, or the presence of foreign bodies in the intestines.\nUnlike mechanical obstruction, non-mechanical\nobstruction, called ileus or paralytic ileus, occurs becauseperistalsis stops. Peristalsis is the rhythmic contractionthat moves material through the bowel. Ileus is most oftenassociated with an infection of the peritoneum (the mem-brane lining the abdomen). It is one of the major causes ofbowel obstruction in infants and children.\nAnother common cause of ileus is a disruption or\nreduction of the blood supply to the abdomen. Handlingthe bowel during abdominal surgery can also cause peri-stalsis to stop, so people who have had abdominalsurgery are more likely to experience ileus. When ileusresults from abdominal surgery the condition is oftentemporary and usually lasts only 48–72 hours.\nIleus can also be caused by kidney diseases, especial-\nly when potassium levels are decreased. Heart disease andcertain chemotherapy drugs, such as vinblastine (Velban,\nVelsar) and vincristine (Oncovin, Vincasar PES, Vincrex),also can cause ileus. Infants with cystic fibrosis are more\nlikely to experience meconium ileus (a dark green materi-al in the intestine). Over all, the total rate of bowelobstruction due both to mechanical and non-mechanicalcauses is one in one thousand people (1/1,000).\nCauses and symptoms\nWhen the bowel stops functioning, the following\nsymptoms occur:\n• abdominal cramping\n• abdominal distention\n• nausea and vomiting• failure to pass gas or stool\nDiagnosis\nWhen a doctor listens with a stethoscope to the\nabdomen there will be few or no bowel sounds, indicatingthat the intestine has stopped functioning. Ileus can beconfirmed by x rays of the abdomen, computed tomog-\nraphy scans (CT scans), or ultrasound. It may be neces-\nsary to do more invasive tests, such as a barium enema\nor upper GI series, if the obstruction is mechanical. Bloodtests also are useful in diagnosing paralytic ileus.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1779IleusBarium studies are used in cases of mechanical\nobstruction, but may cause problems by increasing pres-sure or intestinal contents if used in ileus. Also, in casesof suspected mechanical obstruction involving the gas-trointestinal tract (from the small intestine downward)use of barium x rays are contraindicated, since they maycontribute to the obstruction. In such cases a bariumenema should always be done first.\nTreatment\nPatients may be treated with supervised bed rest in a\nhospital, and bowel rest—where nothing is taken by mouthand patients are fed intravenously or through the use of anasogastric tube. A nasogastric tube is a tube insertedthrough the nose, down the throat, and into the stomach. Asimilar tube can be inserted in the intestine. The contents arethen suctioned out. In some cases, especially where there isa mechanical obstruction, surgery may be necessary.\nDrug therapies that promote intestinal motility (ability\nof the intestine to move spontaneously), such as cisaprideand vasopressin (Pitressin), are sometimes prescribed.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative practitioners offer few treatment sugges-\ntions, but focus on prevention by keeping the bowelshealthy through eating a good diet, high in fiber and lowin fat. If the case is not a medical emergency, homeopath-ic treatment and traditional Chinese medicine can rec-\nommend therapies that may help to reinstate peristalsis.\nPrognosis\nThe outcome varies depending on the cause of ileus.\nPrevention\nMost cases of ileus are not preventable. Surgery to\nremove a tumor or other mechanical obstruction willhelp prevent a recurrence.KEY TERMS\nComputed tomography scan (or CT scan) —A com-\nputer enhanced x-ray study performed to detectabnormalities that do not show up on normal x rays.\nMeconium —A greenish fecal material that forms\nthe first bowel movement of an infant.\nPeritoneum —The transparent membrane lining\nthe abdominal cavity that holds organs, such asthe intestines, in place.Resources\nOTHER\n“Intestinal Obstruction.” HealthAnswers.com. <http://www.\nhealthanswers.com/database/ami/converted/000260.html>.\n“Bowel Paralysis.” Trigan Oncology Associates Page. <http://\nwww.trigan.com/ileus.htm>.\nTish Davidson"

    "content": "Immobilization\nDefinition\nImmobilization refers to the process of holding a joint\nor bone in place with a splint, cast, or brace. This is doneto prevent an injured area from moving while it heals.\nPurpose\nSplints, casts, and braces support and protect broken\nbones, dislocated joints, and such injured soft tissue astendons and ligaments. Immobilization restricts motionto allow the injured area to heal. It can help reduce pain ,\nswelling, and muscle spasm. In some cases, splints andcasts are applied after surgical procedures that repairbones, tendons, or ligaments. This allows for protectionand proper alignment early in the healing phase.\nPrecautions\nThere are no special precautions for immobilization.\nDescription\nWhen an arm, hand, leg, or foot requires immobi-\nlization, the cast, splint, or brace will generally extendfrom the joint above the injury to the joint below theinjury. For example, an injury to the mid-calf requiresimmobilization from the knee to the ankle and foot.Injuries of the hip and upper thigh or shoulder and upperarm require a cast that encircles the body and extendsdown the injured leg or arm.\nCasts and splints\nCasts are generally used for immobilization of a bro-\nken bone. Once the doctor makes sure the two brokenends of the bone are aligned, a cast is put on to keep themin place until they are rejoined through natural healing.Casts are applied by a physician, a nurse, or an assistant.They are custom-made to fit each person, and are usuallymade of plaster or fiberglass. Fiberglass weighs less thanplaster, is more durable, and allows the skin more ade-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1780Immobilizationquate airflow than plaster. A layer of cotton or synthetic\npadding is first wrapped around the skin to cover theinjured area and protect the skin. The plaster or fiberglassis then applied over this.\nMost casts should not be gotten wet. However, some\ntypes of fiberglass casts use Gore-tex padding that iswaterproof and allows the person to completely immersethe cast in water when taking a shower or bath. There aresome circumstances when this type of cast material cannot be used.\nA splint is often used to immobilize a dislocated\njoint while it heals. Splints are also often used for fin-ger injuries, such as fractures or baseball finger. Base-\nball finger is an injury in which the tendon at the endof the finger is separated from the bone as a result oftrauma. Splinting also is used to immobilize an injuredarm or leg immediately after an injury. Before movinga person who has injured an arm or leg some type oftemporary splint should be applied to prevent furtherinjury to the area. Splints may be made of acrylic,polyethylene foam, plaster of paris, or aluminum. In anemergency, a splint can be made from a piece of woodor rolled magazine.\nSlings\nSlings are often used to support the arm after a frac-\nture or other injury. They are generally used along with acast or splint, but sometimes are used alone as a means ofimmobilization. They can be used in an emergency toimmobilize the arm until the person can be seen by adoctor. A triangular bandage is placed under the injuredarm and then tied around the neck.Braces\nBraces are used to support, align, or hold a body part\nin the correct position. Braces are sometimes used after asurgical procedure is performed on an arm or leg. Theycan also be used for an injury. Since some braces can beeasily taken off and put back on, they are often used whenthe person must have physical therapy or exercise the\nlimb during the healing process. Many braces can also beadjusted to allow for a certain amount of movement.\nBraces can be custom-made, or a ready-made brace\ncan be used. The off-the-shelf braces are made in a vari-ety of shapes and sizes. They generally have Velcrostraps that make the brace easy to adjust, and to put onand take off. Both braces and splints offer less supportand protection than a cast and may not be a treatmentoption in all circumstances.\nCollars\nA collar is generally used for neck injuries. A soft\ncollar can relieve pain by restricting movement of thehead and neck. They also transfer some of the weight ofthe head from the neck to the chest. Stiff collars are gen-erally used to support the neck when there has been afracture in one of the bones of the neck. Cervical collarsare widely used by emergency personnel at the scene ofinjuries when there is a potential neck or head injury .\nTraction\nImmobilization may also be secured by traction .\nTraction involves using a method for applying tension tocorrect the alignment of two structures (such as two\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1781Immobilization\nTriangle sling Cravat sling Basket slingAir splint\nBoard splint\nImmobilization refers to the process of immobilizing or fixating the position of a joint, bone, extremity, or torso with a splint,\ncast, or brace. Immobilization can help reduce pain, swelling, and muscle spasms.The illustrations above feature severaltypes of immobilization techniques. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)bones) and hold them in the correct position. For exam-\nple, if the bone in the thigh breaks, the broken ends mayhave a tendency to overlap. Use of traction will holdthem in the correct position for healing to occur. Thestrongest form of traction involves inserting a stainlesssteel pin through a bony prominence attached by a horse-shoe shaped bow and rope to a pulley and weights sus-pended over the end of the patient’s bed.\nTraction must be balanced by countertraction. This is\nobtained by tilting the bed and allowing the patient’s bodyto act as a counterweight. Another technique involvesapplying weights pulling in the opposite direction.\nTraction for neck injuries may be in the form of a\nleather or cotton cloth halter placed around the chin andlower back of the head. For very severe neck injuries thatrequire maximum traction, tongs that resemble ice tongsare inserted into small holes drilled in the outer skull.\nAll traction requires careful observation and adjust-\nment by doctors and nurses to maintain proper balanceand alignment of the traction with free suspension of theweights.\nImmobilization can also be secured by a form of\ntraction called skin traction. This is a combination of asplint and traction that is applied to the arms or legs bystrips of adhesive tape placed over the skin of the arm orleg. Adhesive strips, moleskin, or foam rubber tractionstrips are applied on the skin. This method is effectiveonly if a moderate amount of traction is required.\nPreparation\nThere are many reasons for immobilization using\nsplints, casts, and braces. Each person should understandhis or her diagnosis clearly.KEY TERMS\nDecubitus ulcers — A pressure sore resulting from\nulceration of the skin occurring in persons con-fined to bed for long periods of time\nLigament —Ligaments are structures that hold\nbones together and prevent excessive movement ofthe joint. They are tough, fibrous bands of tissue.\nPneumonia — An acute or chronic disease char-\nacterized by inflammation of the lungs and causedby viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms.\nTendon —Tendons are structures that attach bones\nto muscles and muscles to other muscles.Aftercare\nAfter a cast or splint has been put on, the injured arm\nor leg should be elevated for 24 to 72 hours. It is recom-mended that the person lie or sit with the injured arm orleg raised above the level of the heart. Rest combinedwith elevation will reduce pain and speed the healingprocess by minimizing swelling.\nFingers or toes can be exercised as much as can be\ntolerated after casting. This has been found to decreaseswelling and prevent stiffness. If excessive swelling isnoted, the application of ice to the splint or cast may behelpful.\nAfter the cast, splint, or brace is removed, gradual\nexercise is usually performed to regain muscle strengthand motion. The doctor may also recommend hydro-\ntherapy ,heat treatments , and other forms of physical\ntherapy.\nRisks\nFor some people, such as those in traction, immobi-\nlization will require long periods of bedrest. Lying in oneposition in bed for an extended period of time can resultin sores on the skin (decubitus ulcers) and skin infection.Long periods of bedrest can also cause a buildup of fluidin the lungs or an infection in the lungs ( pneumonia ).\nUrinary infection can also be a result of extended bedrest.\nPeople who have casts, splints, or braces on their\narms or legs will generally spend several weeks not usingthe injured arm or leg. This lack of use can result indecreased muscle tone and shrinkage of the muscle (atro-phy). Much of this loss can usually be regained, however,through rehabilitation after the injury has healed.\nImmobility can also cause psychological stress . An\nindividual restricted to a bed with a traction device maybecome frustrated and bored, and perhaps evendepressed, irritable, and withdrawn.\nThere is the possibility of decreased circulation if\nthe cast, splint, or brace fits too tightly. Excessive pres-sure over a nerve can cause irritation or possible damageif not corrected. If the cast, splint, or brace breaks or mal-functions, the healing process of the bone or soft tissuecan be disrupted and lead to deformity.\nNormal results\nNormally, the surgical or injured area heals appro-\npriately with the help of immobilization. The form ofimmobilization can be discontinued, which is followedby an appropriate rehabilitation program under the super-vision of a physical therapist to regain range of motionand strength.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1782ImmobilizationResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Red Cross.

    "content": "Immune complex test\nDefinition\nThese tests evaluate the immune system, whose\nfunction is to defend the body against such invaders asbacteria and viruses. The immune system also plays arole in the control of cancer , and is responsible for the\nphenomena of allergy, hypersensitivity, and rejectionproblems when organs or tissue are transplanted.\nOne of the ways the immune system protects the\nbody is by producing proteins called antibodies. Anti-bodies are formed in response to another type of proteincalled an antigen (anything foreign or different from anatural body protein). Immune complex reactions occurwhen large numbers of antigen-antibody complexesaccumulate in the body.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the immune complex test is to\ndemonstrate circulating immune complexes in the blood,to estimate the severity of immune complex disease, andto monitor response to therapy.\nPrecautions\nBecause this test is requested when the physician\nsuspects that a patient’s immune system is not functioningproperly, special care should be taken during and afterblood is drawn. For example, the venipuncture site shouldbe kept clean and dry to avoid any chance of infection.\nDescription\nImmune complexes are normally not detected in the\nblood. However, when immune complexes are producedfaster than they can be cleared by the system, immunecomplex disease may occur. Examples of such disordersare drug sensitivity, rheumatoid arthritis , and a disease\ncalled systemic lupus erythematosus , or SLE.\nThe method generally used for detecting immune\ncomplexes is examination of a tissue obtained by biopsy(removal and examination of tissue sample) and the sub-sequent use of different staining techniques with specificantibodies. However, since tissue biopsies do not provideinformation about the level of complexes still in the cir-culatory system, serum assays obtained from blood sam-ples which indirectly detect circulating immune com-plexes are useful. However, due to the variability of thesecomplexes, several test methods may be used. Also, asmost immune complex assays have not been standard-ized, more than one test may be required to achieve accu-rate results.\nPreparation\nThis test requires a blood sample. It is not necessary\nfor the patient to be in a fasting (nothing to eat or drink)\nstate before the test.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\nNormal results\nNormally, immune complexes are not detected in the\nblood.\nAbnormal results\nThe presence of detectable immune complexes in\nthe blood is important in the diagnosis of autoimmunediseases, such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis. However,for definitive diagnosis, the results of other studies mustbe considered with the presence of any immune complex.For example, immune complexes are associated withhigh numbers of a component called antinuclear antibod-ies in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Adifferent example are the kidneys. Because of their filter-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1783Immune complex testing functions, elements in the kidneys called renal\nglomeruli can be affected by immune complexes.

As a result, the person with an immunodefi-\nciency disorder will have frequent infections that aregenerally more severe and last longer than usual.\nDescription\nThe immune system is the body’s main system to\nfight infections. Any defect in the immune systemdecreases a person’s ability to fight infections. A personwith an immunodeficiency disorder may get more fre-quent infections, heal more slowly, and have a higherincidence of some cancers.\nThe normal immune system involves a complex\ninteraction of certain types of cells that can recognizeand attack “foreign” invaders, such as bacteria, viruses,and fungi. It also plays a role in fighting cancer . The\nimmune system has both innate and adaptive compo-nents. Innate immunity is made up of immune protec-tions people are born with. Adaptive immunity developsthroughout life. It adapts to fight off specific invadingorganisms. Adaptive immunity is divided into two com-ponents: humoral immunity and cellular immunity.\nThe innate immune system is made up of the skin\n(which acts as a barrier to prevent organisms from enter-ing the body), white blood cells called phagocytes, a sys-tem of proteins called the complement system, andchemicals called interferonso. When phagocytesencounter an invading organism, they surround andengulf it to destroy it. The complement system alsoattacks bacteria. The elements in the complement systemcreate a hole in the outer layer of the target cell, whichleads to the death of the cell.\nThe adaptive component of the immune system is\nextremely complex, and is still not entirely understood.Basically, it has the ability to recognize an organism ortumor cell as not being a normal part of the body, and todevelop a response to attempt to eliminate it.\nThe humoral response of adaptive immunity\ninvolves a type of cell called B lymphocytes. B lympho-cytes manufacture proteins called antibodies (which arealso called immunoglobulins). Antibodies attach them-selves to the invading foreign substance. This allows thephagocytes to begin engulfing and destroying the organ-ism. The action of antibodies also activates the comple-ment system. The humoral response is particularly usefulfor attacking bacteria.\nThe cellular response of adaptive immunity is useful\nfor attacking viruses, some parasites, and possibly cancercells. The main type of cell in the cellular response is Tlymphocytes. There are helper T lymphocytes and killerT lymphocytes. The helper T lymphocytes play a role inrecognizing invading organisms, and they also help killer\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1784ImmunodeficiencyT lymphocytes to multiply. As the name suggests, killer\nT lymphocytes act to destroy the target organism.\nDefects can occur in any component of the immune\nsystem or in more than one component (combinedimmunodeficiency). Different immunodeficiency dis-eases involve different components of the immune sys-tem. The defects can be inherited and/or present at birth(congenital) or acquired.\nCongenital immunodeficiency disorders\nCongenital immunodeficiency is present at the time\nof birth, and is the result of genetic defects. Even thoughmore than 70 different types of congenital immunodefi-ciency disorders have been identified, they rarely occur.Congenital immunodeficiencies may occur as a result ofdefects in B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, or both. Theycan also occur in the innate immune system.\nB LYMPHOCYTE DEFICIENCIES. If there is an abnor-\nmality in either the development or function of B lympho-cytes, the ability to make antibodies will be impaired. Thisallows the body to be susceptible to recurrent infections.\nBruton’s agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-\nlinked agammaglobulinemia , is one of the most com-\nmon congenital immunodeficiency disorders. The defectresults in a decrease or absence of B lymphocytes, andtherefore a decreased ability to make antibodies. Peoplewith this disorder are particularly susceptible to infec-tions of the throat, skin, middle ear, and lungs. It is seenonly in males because it is caused by a genetic defect onthe X chromosome. Since males have only one X chro-mosome, they always have the defect if the gene is pre-sent. Females can have the defective gene, but since theyhave two X chromosomes, there will be a normal gene onthe other X chromosome to counter it. Women may passthe defective gene on to their male children.\nAnother type of B lymphocyte deficiency involves a\ngroup of disorders called selective immunoglobulin defi-ciency syndomes. Immunoglobulin is another name forantibody, and there are five different types ofimmunoglobulins (called IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE).The most common type of immunoglobulin deficiency isselective IgA deficiency. The amounts of the other anti-body types are normal. Some patients with selective IgAdeficiency experience no symptoms, while others haveoccasional lung infections and diarrhea . In another\nimmunoglobulin disorder, IgG and IgA antibodies aredeficient and there is increased IgM. People with thisdisorder tend to get severe bacterial infections.\nCommon variable immunodeficiency is another\ntype of B lymphocyte deficiency. In this disorder, theproduction of one or more of the immunoglobulin typesis decreased and the antibody response to infections is\nimpaired. It generally develops around the age of 10-20.The symptoms vary among affected people. Most peoplewith this disorder have frequent infections, and some willalso experience anemia and rheumatoid arthritis . Many\npeople with common variable immunodeficiency devel-op cancer.\nT LYMPHOCYTE DEFICIENCIES. Severe defects in the\nability of T lymphocytes to mature results in impairedimmune responses to infections with viruses, fungi, andcertain types of bacteria. These infections are usuallysevere and can be fatal.\nDiGeorge syndrome is a T lymphocyte deficiency\nthat starts during fetal development, but it isn’t inherited.Children with DiGeorge syndrome either do not have athymus or have an underdeveloped thymus. Since thethymus is a major organ that directs the production of T-lymphocytes, these patients have very low numbers of T-lymphocytes. They are susceptible to recurrent infec-tions, and usually have physical abnormalities as well.For example, they may have low-set ears, a small reced-ing jawbone, and wide-spaced eyes.\nIn some cases, no treatment is required for DiGeorge\nsyndrome because T lymphocyte production improves.Either an underdeveloped thymus begins to producemore T lymphocytes or organ sites other than the thymuscompensate by producing more T lymphocytes.\nCOMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCIES. Some types of\nimmunodeficiency disorders affect both B lymphocytesand T lymphocytes. For example, severe combined\nimmunodeficiency disease (SCID) is caused by the\ndefective development or function of these two types oflymphocytes. It results in impaired humoral and cellularimmune responses. SCID is usually recognized duringthe first year of life. It tends to cause a fungal infection ofthe mouth (thrush), diarrhea, failure to thrive , and seri-\nous infections. If not treated with a bone marrow trans-plant, a person with SCID will generally die from infec-tions before age two.\nDISORDERS OF INNATE IMMUNITY. Disorders of\ninnate immunity affect phagocytes or the complementsystem. These disorders also result in recurrent infections.\nAcquired immunodeficiency disorders\nAcquired immunodeficiency is more common than\ncongenital immunodeficiency. It is the result of an infec-tious process or other disease. For example, the humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causesacquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ). Howev-\ner, this is not the most common cause of acquiredimmunodeficiency.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1785ImmunodeficiencyAcquired immunodeficiency often occurs as a com-\nplication of other conditions and diseases. For example,the most common causes of acquired immunodeficiencyare malnutrition , some types of cancer, and infections.\nPeople who weigh less than 70% of the average weightof persons of the same age and gender are considered tobe malnourished. Examples of types of infections thatcan lead to immunodeficiency are chickenpox ,\ncytomegalovirus, German measles , measles, tuberculo-\nsis,infectious mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus),\nchronic hepatitis, lupus, and bacterial and fungal infec-tions.\nSometimes, acquired immunodeficiency is brought\non by drugs used to treat another condition. For example,patients who have an organ transplant are given drugs tosuppress the immune system so the body will not rejectthe organ. Also, some chemotherapy drugs, which are\ngiven to treat cancer, have the side effect of killing cellsof the immune system. During the period of time thatthese drugs are being taken, the risk of infection increas-es. It usually returns to normal after the person stops tak-ing the drugs.\nCauses and symptoms\nCongenital immunodeficiency is caused by genetic\ndefects, and they generally occur while the fetus is devel-oping in the womb. These defects affect the developmentand/or function of one or more of the components of theimmune system. Acquired immunodeficiency is theresult of a disease process, and it occurs later in life. Thecauses, as described above, can be diseases, infections,or the side effects of drugs given to treat other condi-tions.\nPeople with an immunodeficiency disorder tend to\nbecome infected by organisms that don’t usually causedisease in healthy persons. The major symptoms of mostimmunodeficiency disorders are repeated infections thatheal slowly. These chronic infections cause symptomsthat persist for long periods of time. People with chronicinfection tend to be pale and thin. They may have skinrashes . Their lymph nodes tend to be larger than normal\nand their liver and spleen may also be enlarged. Thelymph nodes are small organs that house antibodies andlymphocytes. Broken blood vessels, especially near thesurface of the skin, may be seen. This can result in black-and-blue marks in the skin. The person may lose hairfrom their head. Sometimes, a red inflammation of thelining of the eye ( conjunctivitis ) is present. They may\nhave a crusty appearance in and on the nose from chronicnasal dripping.Diagnosis\nUsually, the first sign that a person might have an\nimmunodeficiency disorder is that they don’t improverapidly when given antibiotics to treat an infection.\nStrong indicators that an immunodeficiency disordermay be present is when rare diseases occur or the patientgets ill from organisms that don’t normally cause dis-eases, especially if the patient gets repeatedly infected. Ifthis happens in very young children it is an indicationthat a genetic defect may be causing an immunodeficien-cy disorder. When this situation occurs in older childrenor young adults, their medical history will be reviewed todetermine if childhood diseases may have caused animmunodeficiency disorder. Other possibilities will thenbe considered, such as recently acquired infections—forexample, HIV , hepatitis, tuberculosis, etc.\nLaboratory tests are used to determine the exact\nnature of the immunodeficiency. Most tests are per-formed on blood samples. Blood contains antibodies,lymphocytes, phagocytes, and complement compo-nents— all of the major immune components that mightcause immunodeficiency. A blood cell count will deter-mine if the number of phagocytic cells or lymphocytes isbelow normal. Lower than normal counts of either ofthese two cell types correlates with immunodeficiencies.The blood cells are also checked for their appearance.Sometimes a person may have normal cell counts, but thecells are structurally defective. If the lymphocyte cellcount is low, further testing is usually done to determinewhether any particular type of lymphocyte is lower thannormal. A lymphocyte proliferation test is done to deter-mine if the lymphocytes can respond to stimuli. The fail-ure to respond to stimulants correlates with immunodefi-ciency. Antibody levels can be measured by a processcalled electrophoresis. Complement levels can be deter-mined by immunodiagnostic tests.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for immunodeficiency disorders.\nTherapy is aimed at controlling infections and, for somedisorders, replacing defective or absent components.\nPatients with Bruton’s agammaglobulinemia must be\ngiven periodic injections of a substance called gammaglobulin throughout their lives to make up for theirdecreased ability to make antibodies. The gamma globulinpreparation contains antibodies against common invadingbacteria. If left untreated, the disease is usually fatal.\nCommon variable immunodeficiency also is treated\nwith periodic injections of gamma globulin throughoutlife. Additionally, antibiotics are given when necessary totreat infections.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1786ImmunodeficiencyPatients with selective IgA deficiency usually do not\nrequire any treatment. Antibiotics can be given for fre-quent infections.\nIn some cases, no treatment is required for DiGeorge\nsyndrome because T lymphocyte production improves onits own. Either an underdeveloped thymus begins to pro-duce more T lymphocytes or organ sites other than thethymus compensate by producing more T lymphocytes.In some severe cases, a bone marrow transplant or thy-mus transplant can be done to correct the problem.\nFor patients with SCID, bone marrow transplan-\ntation is necessary. In this procedure, healthy bone mar-\nrow from a donor who has a similar type of tissue (usu-ally a relative, like a brother or sister) is removed. Thebone marrow is a substance that resides in the cavity ofbones. It is the factory that produces blood, includingsome of the white blood cells that make up the immunesystem. The bone marrow of the person receiving thetransplant is destroyed, and is then replaced with mar-row from the donor.\nTreatment of the HIV infection that causes AIDS\nconsists of drugs called antivirals. These drugs attempt toinhibit the process that the virus goes through to kill Tlymphocytes. Several of these drugs used in various com-binations with one another can prolong the period of timebefore the disease becomes apparent. However, this isnot a cure. Other treatments for people with AIDS areaimed at the particular infections that arise as a result ofthe impaired immune system.\nIn most cases, immunodeficiency caused by malnu-\ntrition is reversible. The health of the immune system isdirectly linked to the nutritional health of the patient.Among the essential nutrients required by the immunesystem are proteins, vitamins , iron, and zinc.\nFor people being treated for cancer, periodic relief\nfrom chemotherapy drugs can restore the function of theimmune system.\nIn general, people with immunodeficiency disorders\nshould maintain a healthy diet. This is because malnutri-tion can aggravate immunodeficiencies. They should alsoavoid being near people who have colds or are sickbecause they can easily acquire new infections. For thesame reason, they should practice good personalhygiene, especially dental care. People with immunode-ficiency disorders should also avoid eating undercookedfood because it might contain bacteria that could causeinfection. This food would not cause infection in normalpersons, but in someone with an immunodeficiency, foodis a potential source of infectious organisms. People withimmunodeficiency should be given antibiotics at the firstindication of an infection.KEY TERMS\nAgammaglobulinemia —The lack of gamma glob-\nulins in the blood. Antibodies are the main gammaglobulins of interest, so this term means a lack ofantibodies.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the type of immunodefi-\nciency disorder. People with Bruton’s agammaglobuline-mia who are given injections of gamma globulin general-ly live into their 30s or 40s. They often die from chronicinfections, usually of the lung. People with selective IgAdeficiency generally live normal lives. They may experi-ence problems if given a blood transfusion , and there-\nfore they should wear a Medic Alert bracelet or havesome other way of alerting any physician who treatsthem that they have this disorder.\nSCID is the most serious of the immunodeficiency dis-\norders. If a bone marrow transplant is not successfully per-formed, the child usually will not live beyond two years old.\nPeople with HIV/AIDS are living longer than in the\npast because of the antiviral drugs that became avail-\nable in the mid 1990s. However, AIDS is still a fatal dis-ease. People with AIDS usually die of opportunisticinfections, which are infections that occur because theimpaired immune system is unable to fight them.\nPrevention\nThere is no way to prevent a congenital immunode-\nficiency disorder. However, someone with a congenitalimmunodeficiency disorder might want to consider get-ting genetic counseling before having children to find\nout if there is a chance they will pass the defect on totheir children.\nSome of the infections associated with acquired\nimmunodeficiency can be prevented or treated before theycause problems. For example, there are effective treat-ments for tuberculosis and most bacterial and fungal infec-tions. HIV infection can be prevented by practicing “safesex” and not using illegal intravenous drugs. These are theprimary routes of transmitting the virus. For people whodon’t know the HIV status of the person with whom theyare having sex, safe sex involves using a condom .\nMalnutrition can be prevented by getting adequate\nnutrition . Malnutrition tends to be more of a problem in\ndeveloping countries.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1787ImmunodeficiencyResources\nBOOKS\nAbbas, A. K., A. H. Lichtman, and J. S. Pober.

    "title": "Immunoelectrophoresis",
    "content": "Immunoelectrophoresis\nDefinition\nImmunoelectrophoresis, also called gamma globulin\nelectrophoresis, or immunoglobulin electrophoresis, is amethod of determining the blood levels of three majorimmunoglobulins: immunoglobulin M (IgM),immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin A (IgA).\nPurpose\nImmunoelectrophoresis is a powerful analytical\ntechnique with high resolving power as it combines sepa-ration of antigens by electrophoresis with immunodiffu-sion against an antiserum. The increased resolution is ofbenefit in the immunological examination of serum pro-teins. Immunoelectrophoresis aids in the diagnosis andevaluation of the therapeutic response in many diseasestates affecting the immune system. It is usually request-ed when a different type of electrophoresis, called aserum protein electrophoresis , has indicated a rise at\nthe immunoglobulin level. Immunoelectrophoresis isalso used frequently to diagnose multiple myeloma ,a\ndisease affecting the bone marrow.\nPrecautions\nDrugs that may cause increased immunoglobulin\nlevels include therapeutic gamma globulin, hydralazine,isoniazid, phenytoin (Dilantin), procainamide, oral con-\ntraceptives ,methadone , steroids, and tetanus toxoid\nand antitoxin. The laboratory should be notified if thepatient has received any vaccinations or immunizationsin the six months before the test. This is mainly becauseprior immunizations lead to the increased immunoglobu-lin levels resulting in false positive results.\nIt should be noted that, because immunoelec-\ntrophoresis is not quantitative, it is being replaced by aprocedure called immunofixation, which is more sensi-tive and easier to interpret.\nDescription\nSerum proteins separate in agar gels under the influ-\nence of an electric field into albumin, alpha 1, alpha 2, andbeta and gamma globulins. Immunoelectrophoresis is per-formed by placing serum on a slide containing a geldesigned specifically for the test. An electric current isthen passed through the gel, and immunoglobulins, whichcontain an electric charge, migrate through the gel accord-ing to the difference in their individual electric charges.Antiserum is placed alongside the slide to identify the spe-cific type of immunoglobulin present. The results are usedto identify different disease entities, and to aid in monitor-ing the course of the disease and the therapeutic responseof the patient to such conditions as immune deficiencies,autoimmune disease, chronic infections, chronic viralinfections, and intrauterine fetal infections.\nThere are five classes of antibodies: IgM, IgG, IgA,\nIgE, and IgD.\nIgM is produced upon initial exposure to an antigen.\nFor example, when a person receives the first tetanusvaccination , antitetanus antibodies of the IgM class are\nproduced 10–14 days later. IgM is abundant in the bloodbut is not normally present in organs or tissues. IgM isprimarily responsible for ABO blood grouping andrheumatoid factor, yet is involved in the immunologicreaction to other infections, such as hepatitis. Since IgMdoes not cross the placenta, an elevation of thisimmunoglobulin in the newborn indicates intrauterineinfection such as rubella , cytomegalovirus (CMV) or a\nsexually transmitted disease (STD).\nIgG is the most prevalent type of antibody, compris-\ning approximately 75% of the serum immunoglobulins.IgG is produced upon subsequent exposure to an antigen.As an example, after receiving a second tetanus shot, orbooster, a person produces IgG antibodies in five toseven days. IgG is present in both the blood and tissues,and is the only antibody to cross the placenta from themother to the fetus. Maternal IgG protects the newbornfor the first months of life, until the infant’s immune sys-tem produces its own antibodies.\nIgA constitutes approximately 15% of the immuno-\nglobulins within the body. Although it is found to somedegree in the blood, it is present primarily in the secre-tions of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, in sali-va, colostrum (the yellowish fluid produced by thebreasts during late pregnancy and the first few days after\nchildbirth ), and in tears. IgA plays an important role in\ndefending the body against invasion of germs through themucous membrane-lined organs.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1788ImmunoelectrophoresisIgE is the antibody that causes acute allergic reac-\ntions; it is measured to detect allergic conditions. IgD,which constitutes the smallest portion of the immuno-globulins, is rarely evaluated or detected, and its functionis not well understood.\nPreparation\nThis test requires a blood sample.\nAftercare\nBecause this test is ordered when either very low or\nvery high levels of immunoglobulins are suspected, thepatient should be alert for any signs of infection after thetest, including fever , chills, rash, or skin ulcers. Any\nbone pain or tenderness should also be immediately\nreported to the physician.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or bruising.\nNormal results\nReference ranges vary from laboratory to laboratory\nand depend upon the method used. For adults, normalvalues are usually found within the following ranges (1mg = approximately.000035 oz. and 1 dL = approximate-ly. 33 oz.):\n• IgM: 60–290 mg/dL\n• IgG: 700–1,800 mg/dL• IgA: 70–440 mg/dL\nAbnormal results\nIncreased IgM levels can indicate Waldenström’s\nmacroglobulinemia, a malignancy caused by secretion ofIgM at high levels by malignant lymphoplasma cells.Increased IgM levels can also indicate chronic infections,such as hepatitis or mononucleosis and autoimmune dis-eases, like rheumatoid arthritis .\nDecreased IgM levels can be indicative of AIDS ,\nimmunosuppression caused by certain drugs like steroidsor dextran, or leukemia.\nIncreased levels of IgG can indicate chronic liver\ndisease, autoimmune diseases, hyperimmunization reac-tions, or certain chronic infections, such as tuberculosis\nor sarcoidosis .\nDecreased levels of IgG can indicate Wiskott-\nAldrich syndrome , a genetic deficiency caused by inade-\nquate synthesis of IgG and other immunoglobulins.Decreased IgG can also be seen with AIDS and leukemia.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —A protein manufactured by the white\nblood cells to neutralize an antigen in the body. Insome cases, excessive formation of antibodiesleads to illness, allergy, or autoimmune disorders.\nAntigen —A substance that can cause an immune\nresponse, resulting in production of an antibody,as part of the body’s defense against infection anddisease. Many antigens are foreign proteins notfound naturally in the body, and include germs,toxins, and tissues from another person used inorgan transplantation.\nAutoimmune disorder —A condition in which\nantibodies are formed against the body’s own tis-sues; for example, in some forms of arthritis.\nIncreased levels of IgA can indicate chronic liver dis-\nease, chronic infections, or inflammatory bowel disease.\nDecreased levels of IgA can be found in ataxia, a\ncondition affecting balance and gait, limb or eye move-ments, speech, and telangiectasia, an increase in the sizeand number of the small blood vessels in an area of skin,causing redness. Decreased IgA levels are also seen inconditions of low blood protein (hypoproteinemia), anddrug immunosuppression.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew. Handbook of Diagnostic Tests.

There are five\nmajor classes of antibodies: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE.\n• IgG is the most abundant of the classes of immunoglob-\nulins. It is the antibody for viruses, bacteria, and anti-toxins. It is found in most tissues and plasma.\n• IgM is the first antibody present in an immune response.• IgA is an early antibody for bacteria and viruses. It is\nfound in saliva, tears, and all other mucous secretions.\n• IgD activity is not well understood.• IgE is present in the respiratory secretions. It is an anti-\nbody for parasitic diseases, Hodgkin’s disease , hay\nfever ,atopic dermatitis , and allergic asthma ).\nAll antibodies are made by B-lymphocytes (B-cells).\nAny disease that harms the development or function of B-cells will cause a decrease in the amount of antibodies pro-duced. Since antibodies are essential in fighting infectiousdiseases, people with immunoglobulin deficiency syn-dromes become ill more often. However, the cellularimmune system is still functional, so these patients aremore prone to infection caused by organisms usually con-trolled by antibodies. Most of these invading germs(microbes) make capsules, a mechanism used to confusethe immune system. In a healthy body, antibodies can bindto the capsule and overcome the bacteria’s defenses. Thebacteria that make capsules include the streptococci,meningococci, and Haemophilus influenzae . These organ-\nisms cause such diseases as otitis, sinusitis ,pneumonia ,\nmeningitis ,osteomyelitis , septic arthritis, and sepsis .\nPatients with immunoglobulin deficiencies are also proneto some viral infections, including echovirus, enterovirus,and hepatitis B . They may also have a bad reaction to the\nattenuated version of the polio virus vaccine.\nThere are two types of immunodeficiency diseases:\nprimary and secondary. Secondary disorders occur innormally healthy bodies that are suffering from an under-lying disease. Once the disease is treated, the immunode-ficiency is reversed. Immunoglobulin deficiency syn-dromes are primary immunodeficiency diseases, occur-ring because of defective B-cells or antibodies. Theyaccount for 50% of all primary immunodeficiencies, andthey are, therefore, the most prevalent type of immunod-eficiency disorders.\n• X-linked agammaglobulinemia is an inherited disease.\nThe defect is on the X chromosome and, consequently,this disease is seen more frequently in males thanfemales. The defect results in a failure of B-cells tomature. Mature B-cells are capable of making antibod-ies and developing “memory,” a feature in which the B-cell will rapidly recognize and respond to an infectiousagent the next time it is encountered. All classes of anti-\nbodies are decreased in agammaglobulinemia.\n• Selective IgA deficiency is an inherited disease, result-\ning from a failure of B-cells to switch from makingIgM, the early antibody, to IgA. Although the B-cellnumbers are normal, and the B-cells are otherwise nor-mal (they can still make all other classes of antibodies),the amount of IgA produced is limited. This results inmore infections of mucosal surfaces, such as the nose,throat, lungs, and intestines.\n• Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy is a tem-\nporary disease of unknown cause. It is believed to becaused by a defect in the development of T-helper cells(cells that recognize foreign antigens and activate T-and B-cells in an immune response). As the child ages,the number and condition of T-helper cells improvesand this situation corrects itself. Hypogammaglobuline-mia is characterized by low levels of gammaglobulin\n(antibodies) in the blood. During the disease period,patients have decreased levels of IgG and IgA antibod-ies. In lab tests, the antibodies that are present do notreact well with infectious bacteria.\n• Common variable immunodeficiency is a defect in both\nB cells and T-lymphocytes. It results in a near completelack of antibodies in the blood.\n• Ig heavy chain deletions is a genetic disease in which\npart of the antibody molecule isn’t produced. It resultsin the loss of several antibody classes and subclassesincluding most IgG antibodies and all IgA and IgE anti-bodies. The disease occurs because part of the gene forthe heavy chain has been lost.\n• Selective IgG subclass deficiencies is a group of genetic\ndiseases in which some of the subclasses of IgG are notmade. There are four subclasses in the IgG class of anti-bodies. As the B-cell matures, it can switch from one sub-class to another. In these diseases there is a defect in thematuration of the B-cells that results in a lack of switching.\n• IgG deficiency with hyper-IgM is a disease that results\nwhen the B-cell fails to switch from making IgM to IgG.This produces an increase in the amount of IgM anti-bodies present and a decrease in the amount of IgGanti-bodies. This disease is the result of a genetic mutation.\nCauses and symptoms\nImmunoglobulin deficiencies are the result of con-\ngenital defects affecting the development and function ofB lymphocytes (B-cells). There are two main points inthe development of B-cells when defects can occur. First,B-cells can fail to develop into antibody-producing cells.X-linked agammaglobulinemia is an example of this dis-ease. Secondly, B-cells can fail to make a particular type\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1790Immunoglobulin deficiency syndromesof antibody or fail to switch classes during maturation.\nInitially, when B-cells start making antibodies for thefirst time, they make IgM. As they mature and developmemory, they switch to one of the other four classes ofantibodies. Failures in switching or failure to make a sub-class of antibody leads to immunoglobulin deficiencydiseases. Another mechanism that results in decreasedantibody production is a defect in T-helper cells. Gener-ally, defects in T-helper cells are listed as severe com-bined immunodeficiencies.\nSymptoms are persistent and frequent infections, diar-\nrhea ,failure to thrive , and malabsorption (of nutrients).\nDiagnosis\nAn immunodeficiency disease is suspected when\nchildren become ill frequently, especially from the sameorganisms. The profile of organisms that cause infectionin patients with immunoglobulin deficiency syndrome isunique and is preliminary evidence for this disease. Lab-oratory tests are performed to verify the diagnosis. Anti-bodies can be found in the blood. Blood is collected andanalyzed for the content and types of antibodies present.Depending on the type of immunoglobulin deficiency thelaboratory tests will show a decrease or absence of anti-bodies or specific antibody subclasses.\nTreatment\nImmunodeficiency diseases cannot be cured.\nPatients are treated with antibiotics and immune serum.\nImmune serum is a source of antibodies. Antibiotics areuseful for fighting bacteria infections. There are somedrugs that are effective against fungi, but very few drugsthat are effective against viral diseases.\nBone marrow transplantation can, in most cases,\ncompletely correct the immunodefiency.\nPrognosis\nPatients with immunoglobulin defiency syndromes\nmust practice impeccable health maintenance and care,KEY TERMS\nAntibody —Another term for immunoglobulin.

    "content": "Immunologic therapies\nDefinition\nImmunologic therapy is the treatment of disease\nusing medicines that boost the body’s natural immuneresponse.\nPurpose\nImmunologic therapy is used to improve the\nimmune system’s natural ability to fight such diseases ascancer , hepatitis and AIDS . These drugs may also be\nused to help the body recover from immunosuppressionresulting from such treatments as chemotherapy or\nradiation therapy .\nDescription\nMost drugs in this category are synthetic versions of\nsubstances produced naturally in the body. In their natur-al forms, these substances help defend the body againstdisease. For example, aldesleukin (Proleukin) is an artifi-cially made form of interleukin-2, which helps whiteblood cells work. Aldesleukin is administered to patientswith kidney cancers and skin cancers that have spread toother parts of the body. Filgrastim (Neupogen) and sar-gramostim (Leukine) are versions of natural substancescalled colony stimulating factors, which drive the bonemarrow to make new white blood cells. Another type of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1791Immunologic therapiesdrug, epoetin (Epogen, Procrit), is a synthetic version of\nhuman erythropoietin that stimulates the bone marrow tomake new red blood cells. Thrombopoietin stimulates theproduction of platelets, disk-shaped bodies in the bloodthat are important in clotting. Interferons are substancesthe body produces naturally using immune cells to fightinfections and tumors. The synthetic interferons carrysuch brand names as Alferon, Roferon or Intron A. Someof the interferons that are currently in use as drugs areRecombinant Interferon Alfa-2a, Recombinant InterferonAlfa-2b, interferon alfa-n1 and Interferon Alfa-n3. Alfainterferons are used to treat hairy cell leukemia ,malig-\nnant melanoma and AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma,\nwhich is a form of cancer. In addition interferons are alsoused for such other conditions as laryngeal papillomato-sis,genital warts and certain types of hepatitis.\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\nimmunologic therapy. For some medicines, the physicianwill decide the dosage for each patient, taking into account apatient’s weight and whether he/she is taking other medi-cines. Some drugs used in immunologic therapy are givenonly in a hospital, under a physician’s supervision. For thosethat patients may give themselves, one should check withthe physician who prescribed the medicine or the pharma-cist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage.\nMost of these drugs come in injectable form. These\ndrugs are generally administered by the cancer careprovider.\nPrecautions\nAldesleukin\nThis medicine may temporarily increase the chance\nof getting infections. It may also lower the number ofplatelets in the blood, and thus possibly interfering withthe blood’s ability to clot. Taking these precautions mayreduce the chance of such problems:\n• Avoid people with infections, if possible.\n• Be alert to signs of infection, such as fever , chills, sore\nthroat ,pain in the lower back or side, cough , hoarse-\nness, or painful or difficulty with urination. If any ofthese symptoms occur, get in touch with a physicianimmediately.\n• Be alert to signs of bleeding problems, such as black,\ntarry stools, iny red spots on the skin, blood in the urineor stools, or any other unusual bleeding or bruising.\n• Take care to avoid cuts or other injuries. Be especially\ncareful when using knives, razors, nail clippers andother sharp objects. Check with a dentist for the bestways to clean the teeth and mouth without injuring the\ngums. Do not have dental work done without checkingwith a physician.\n• Wash hands frequently, and avoid touching the eyes or\ninside of the nose unless the hands have just beenwashed.\nAldesleukin may make some medical conditions\nworse, such as chickenpox ,shingles (herpes zoster),\nliver disease, lung disease, heart disease, underactive thy-roid, psoriasis , immune system problems and mental\nproblems. The medicine may increase the chance ofseizures (convulsions) in people who are prone to havingthem. Also, the drug’s effects may be greater in peoplewith kidney disease, because their kidneys are slow toclear the medicine from their bodies.\nColony stimulating factors\nCertain drugs used in treating cancer reduce the\nbody’s ability to fight infections. Although colony stimu-lating factors help restore the body’s natural defenses,the process takes time. Getting prompt treatment forinfections is important, even while taking this medicine.Call the physician at the first sign of illness or infection,such as a sore throat, fever or chills.\nPeople with certain medical conditions could have\nproblems if they take colony stimulating factors. Peoplewho have kidney disease, liver disease or conditionscaused by inflammation or immune system problems canworsen these problems with colony stimulating factors.Those who have heart disease may be more likely toexperience such side effects as water retention and heartrhythm problems while taking these drugs. Finally,patients who have lung disease might increase theirchances of suffering from shortness of breath . Those\nwho have any of these medical conditions should checkwith their personal physicians before using colony stimu-lating factors.\nEpoetin\nEpoetin is a medicine that may cause seizures (con-\nvulsions), especially in people who are prone to havingthem. No one who takes these drugs should drive, usemachines, or do anything considered dangerous in caseof a seizure.\nEpoetin helps the body make new red blood cells, but\nit is not effective unless there is adequate iron in the body.The physician may recommend taking iron supplementsor certain vitamins that help supply the body with iron. It\nis necessary to follow the physician’s advice in thisinstance —recommendations for iron in this case, as withany supplements, should come only from a physician.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1792Immunologic therapiesIn studies of laboratory animals, epoetin taken dur-\ning pregnancy caused birth defects , including damage\nto the bones and spine. However, the drug has not beenreported to cause problems in human babies whosemothers take it. Women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should check with their physicians forthe most up-to-date information on the safety of takingthis medicine during pregnancy.\nPeople with certain medical conditions may have\nproblems if they take this medicine. For example, thechance of side effects may be greater in people with highblood pressure, heart or blood vessel disease or a historyof blood clots. Epoetin may not work properly in peoplewho have bone problems or sickle cell anemia.\nInterferons\nInterferons can add to the effects of alcohol and\nother drugs that slow down the central nervous system,such as antihistamines , cold medicine, allergy medicine,\nsleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, somepain relievers, and muscle relaxants . They may also add\nto the effects of anesthetics, including those used for den-tal procedures. Those taking interferons should checkwith their physicians before taking any of the above.KEY TERMS\nAIDS —Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A\ndisease caused by infection with the human immun-odeficiency virus (HIV). In people with this disease,the immune system breaks down, increasing vulner-ability to other infections and some types of cancer.\nBone marrow —Soft tissue that fills the hollow cen-\nters of bones. Blood cells and platelets (disk-shapedbodies in the blood that are important in clotting)are produced in the bone marrow.\nChemotherapy —Treatment of an illness with chem-\nical agents. The term is usually used to describe thetreatment of cancer with drugs.\nClot—A hard mass that forms when blood coagulates.\nFetus —A developing baby inside the womb.\nHepatitis —Inflammation of the liver caused by a\nvirus, chemical, or drug.\nImmune response —The body’s natural protective\nreaction to disease and infection.\nImmune system —The system that protects the body\nagainst disease and infection through immuneresponses.Inflammation —Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\nthat usually develop in response to injury or illness.\nPsoriasis —A skin disease that manifests itself with\nitchy, scaly, red patches on the skin.\nSeizure —A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.\nShingles —A disease caused by an infection with the\nHerpes zoster virus—the same virus that causeschickenpox. Symptoms of shingles include pain andblisters along one nerve, usually on the face, chest,stomach, or back.\nSickle cell anemia —An inherited disorder in which\nred blood cells contain an abnormal form of hemo-globin, a protein that carries oxygen. The abnormalform of hemoglobin causes the red cells to becomesickle-shaped. The misshapen cells may clog bloodvessels, preventing oxygen from reaching tissuesand leading to pain, blood clots and other prob-lems. Sickle cell anemia is most common in peopleof African descent and in people from Italy, Greece,India, and the Middle East.\nSome people experience dizziness , unusual tired-\nness, or become less alert than usual while being treatedwith these drugs. Because of these possible problems,anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, usemachines or do anything else considered dangerous untilthey have determined how the drugs affect them.\nInterferons often cause flu-like symptoms, including\nfever and chills. The physician who prescribes this medi-cine may recommend taking acetaminophen (Tylenol)\nbefore—and sometimes after—each dose to keep thefever from getting too high. If the physician recommendsthis, follow instructions carefully.\nLike aldesleukin, interferons may temporarily\nincrease the chance of getting infections and lower thenumber of platelets in the blood, leading to clotting prob-lems. To help prevent these problems, follow the precau-tions for reducing the risk of infection and bleeding listedfor aldesleukin.\nPeople who have certain medical conditions may\nhave problems if they take interferons. For example, thedrugs may worsen some medical conditions, includingheart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, lung disease,diabetes, bleeding problems and mental problems. In peo-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1793Immunologic therapiesple who have overactive immune systems, these drugs can\neven increase the activity of the immune system. Peoplewho have shingles or chickenpox, or who have recentlybeen exposed to chickenpox, may increase their risk ofdeveloping severe problems in other parts of the body ifthey take interferons. People with a history of seizures ormental problems could be at risk if taking interferon?\nIn teenage women, interferons may cause changes in\nthe menstrual cycle. Young women should discuss thispossibility with their physicians. Older people may bemore sensitive to the effects of interferons. This sensitivi-ty may increase the chance of side effects.\nThese drugs are not known to cause fetal death ,\nbirth defects or other problems in humans when takenduring pregnancy. Women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should ask their physicians for the lat-est information on the safety of taking these drugs duringpregnancy.\nWomen who are breastfeeding their babies may need\nto stop while taking this medicine. Whether interferonspass into breast milk is not known. Because of thechance of serious side effects to the baby, breastfeedingwhile taking interferon is discouraged. Check with aphysician for advice.\nGeneral precautions for all types of immunologic\ntherapy\nRegular physician visits are necessary during\nimmunologic therapy treatment. This gives the physiciana chance to make sure the medicine is working and tocheck for unwanted side effects.\nAnyone who has had unusual reactions to drugs used\nin immunologic therapy should let the physician knowbefore resuming the drugs. Any allergies to foods, dyes,\npreservatives, or other substances should also be reported.\nSide effects\nAldesleukin\nIn addition to its helpful effects, this medicine may\ncause serious side effects. Generally, it is given only in ahospital, where medical professionals can watch forearly signs of problems. Medical tests might be per-formed to check for unwanted effects.\nAnyone who has breathing problems, fever or chills\nwhile being given aldesleukin should check with a physi-cian immediately.\nOther side effects should be brought to a physician’s\nattention as soon as possible:\n• dizziness• drowsiness\n• confusion\n• agitation\n• depression•nausea and vomiting\n•diarrhea\n• sores in the mouth and on the lips\n• tingling of hands or feet• decrease in urination• unexplained weight gain of five or more pounds\nSome side effects are usually temporary and do not\nneed medical attention unless they are bothersome.These include dry skin; itchy or burning skin rash or red-ness followed by peeling; loss of appetite; and a generalfeeling of illness or discomfort.\nColony stimulating factors\nAs this medicine starts to work, the patient might\nexperience mild pain in the lower back or hips. This isnothing to cause undue concern, and will usually goaway within a few days. If the pain is intense or causesdiscomfort, the physician may prescribe a painkiller.\nOther possible side effects include headache , joint or\nmuscle pain and skin rash or itching . These side effects\ntend to disappear as the body adjusts to the medicine, anddo not need medical treatment. If they continue, or theyinterfere with normal activities, check with a physician.\nEpoetin\nThis medicine may cause flu-like symptoms, such as\nmuscle aches, bone pain, fever, chills, shivering, andsweating, within a few hours after it is taken. These symp-toms usually go away within 12 hours. If they do not, or ifthey are troubling, check with a physician. Other possibleside effects that do not need medical attention are diar-rhea, nausea or vomiting, and tiredness or weakness.\nCertain side effects should be brought to a physi-\ncian’s attention as soon as possible. These includeheadache, vision problems, increased blood pressure,fast heartbeat, weight gain, and swelling of the face, fin-gers, lower legs, ankles or feet.\nAnyone who has chest pain or seizures after taking\nepoetin should seek professional emergency medicalattention immediately.\nInterferons\nThis medicine may cause temporary hair loss. While\nupsetting, it is not a sign that something is seriously\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1794Immunologic therapieswrong. The hair should grow back normally after treat-\nment ends.\nAs the body adjusts to the medicine, many other side\neffects usually go away during treatment. These includeflu-like symptoms, changes in taste, loss of appetite, nau-sea and vomiting, skin rash, and unusual tiredness. Ifthese problems persist, or if they interfere with normallife, check with a physician.\nA few more serious side effects should be brought to\na physician’s attention as soon as possible:\n• confusion\n• difficulty thinking or concentrating• nervousness• depression\n• sleep problems\n• numbness or tingling in the fingers, toes and face\nGeneral caution regarding side effects for all types\nof immunologic therapy\nOther side effects are possible with any type of\nimmunologic therapy. Anyone who has unusual symp-toms during or after treatment with these drugs shouldcontact the physician immediately.\nInteractions\nAnyone who has immunologic therapy should let the\nphysician know all other medicines being taken. Somecombinations of drugs may interact, which may increaseor decrease the effects of one or both drugs or mayincrease the likelihood of side effects.

    "title": "Immunosuppressant drugs",
    "content": "Immunosuppressant drugs\nDefinition\nImmunosuppressant drugs, also called anti-rejection\ndrugs, are used to prevent the body from rejecting atransplanted organ.\nPurpose\nWhen an organ, such as a liver, a heart or a kidney, is\ntransplanted from one person (the donor) into another(the recipient), the immune system of the recipient trig-gers the same response against the new organ it wouldhave to any foreign material, setting off a chain of eventsthat can damage the transplanted organ. This process iscalled rejection and it can occur rapidly (acute rejection),or over a long period of time (chronic rejection). Rejec-tion can occur despite close matching of the donatedorgan and the transplant patient. Immunosuppressantdrugs greatly decrease the risks of rejection, protectingthe new organ and preserving its function. These drugsact by blocking the immune system so that it is less likelyto react against the transplanted organ. A wide variety ofdrugs are available to achieve this aim but work in differ-ent ways to reduce the risk of rejection.\nIn addition to being used to prevent organ rejection,\nimmunosuppressant drugs are also used to treat suchsevere skin disorders as psoriasis and such other dis-\neases as rheumatoid arthritis ,Crohn’s disease (chron-\nic inflammation of the digestive tract) and patchy hairloss ( alopecia areata). Some of these conditions are\ntermed “autoimmune” diseases, indicating that theimmune system is acting against the body itself.\nDescription\nImmunosuppressant drugs can be classified accord-\ning to their specific molecular mode of action. The threemain immunosuppressant drugs currently used in organtransplantations are the following:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1795Immunosuppressant drugs• Cyclosporins (Neoral, Sandimmune, SangCya). These\ndrugs act by inhibiting T-cell activation, thus preventingT-cells from attacking the transplanted organ.\n• Azathioprines (Imuran). These drugs disrupt the syn-\nthesis of DNA and RNA and cell division.\n•Corticosteroids such as prednisolone (Deltasone, Ora-\nsone). These drugs suppress the inflammation associat-ed with transplant rejection.\nMost patients are prescribed a combination of drugs\nafter their transplant, one from each of the above maingroups; for example cyclosporin, azathioprine and pred-nisolone. Over a period of time, the doses of each drugand the number of drugs taken may be reduced as therisks of rejection decrease. However, most patients needto take at least one immunosuppressive for the rest oftheir lives.\nImmunosuppressants can also be classified depend-\ning on the specific transplant:\n• basiliximab (Simulect) is also used, in combination\nwith other drugs such as cyclosporin and corticos-teroids, in kidney transplants\n• daclizumab (Zenapax)is also used, in combination with\nother drugs such as cyclosporin and corticosteroids, inkidney transplants\n• muromonab CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3) is used, along\nwith cyclosporin, in kidney, liver and heart transplants\n• tacrolimus (Prograf) is used in liver transplants. It is\nunder study for kidney, bone marrow, cardiac, pancreas,pancreatic island cell, and small bowel transplantation\nSome immunosuppressants are also used to treat a\nvariety of autoimmune diseases:\n• Azathioprine (Imuran) is used not only to prevent organ\nrejection in kidney transplants, but also in treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis. It has been used to treat chroniculcerative colitis , but it has been of limited value for\nthis use.\n• Cyclosporin (Sandimmune, Neoral) is used in heart,\nliver, kidney, pancreas, bone marrow and heart/lungtransplantation. The Neoral form has been used to treatpsoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. The drug has alsobeen used for many other conditions including multi-\nple sclerosis , diabetes and myesthenia gravis.\n• Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is used in treatment of\nrelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In one study,glatiramer reduced the frequency of multiple sclerosisattacks by 75% over a two-year period.\n• Mycopehnolate (CellCept) is used, along with cyclo-\nsporin, in kidney, liver and heart transplants. It has alsobeen used to prevent the kidney problems associatedwith Lupus Erythematosis.• Sirolimus (Rapamune) is used in combination with\nother drugs including cyclosporin and corticosteroids,in kidney transplants. The drug is also used for thetreatment of psoriasis.\nRecommended dosage\nImmunosuppressant drugs are available only with a\nphysician’s prescription. They come in tablet, capsule,liquid and injectable forms.\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type and\nform of immunosuppressant drug and the purpose forwhich it is being used. Doses may be different for differ-ent patients. The prescribing physician or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription will advise on correct dosage.\nTaking immunosuppressant drugs exactly as direct-\ned is very important. Smaller, larger or more frequentdoses should never be taken, and the drugs should neverbe taken for longer than directed. The physician willdecide exactly how much of the medicine each patientneeds. Blood tests often are necessary to monitor theaction of the drug.\nThe prescribing physician should be consulted\nbefore stopping an immunosuppressant drug.\nPrecautions\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking immuno-\nsuppressant drugs is important. These regular check-upswill allow the physician to make sure the drug is workingas it should and to watch for unwanted side effects.These drugs are very powerful and can cause serious sideeffects, such as high blood pressure, kidney problemsand liver problems. Some side effects may not show upuntil years after the medicine is used. Anyone who hasbeen advised to take immunosuppressant drugs shouldthoroughly discuss the risks and benefits with the pre-scribing physician\nImmunosuppressant drugs lower a person’s resis-\ntance to infection and can make infections harder totreat. The drugs can also increase the chance of uncon-trolled bleeding. Anyone who has a serious infection orinjury while taking immunosuppressant drugs shouldget prompt medical attention and should make surethat the treating physician knows about the immuno-suppressant prescription. The prescribing physicianshould be immediately informed if signs of infection,such as fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, pain in\nthe lower back or side, or painful or difficult urination,bruising or bleeding, blood in the urine, bloody orblack, tarry stools occur. Other ways of preventinginfection and injury include washing the hands fre-quently, avoiding sports in which injuries may occur,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1796Immunosuppressant drugsand being careful when using knives, razors, fingernail\nclippers or other sharp objects. Avoiding contact withpeople who have infections is also important. In addi-tion, people who are taking or have been takingimmunosuppressant drugs should not have immuniza-tions, such as smallpox vaccinations, without checking\nwith their physicians. Because of their low resistanceto infection, people taking these drugs might get thedisease that the vaccine is designed to prevent. Peopletaking immunosuppressant drugs also should avoidcontact with anyone who has taken the oral polio vac-\ncine, as there is a chance the virus could be passed onto them. Other people living in their home should nottake the oral polio vaccine.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —Protein produced by the immune sys-\ntem in response to the presence in the body of anantigen.\nAntigen —Any substance or organism that is foreign\nto the body.

If this happens, aphysician or dentist should be notified. Regular brushing,flossing, cleaning and gum massage may help preventthis problem. A dentist can provide advice on how toclean the teeth and mouth without causing injury.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or who\nare taking certain other medicines may have problems ifthey take immunosuppressant drugs. Before taking thesedrugs, the prescribing physician should be informedabout any of these conditions:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1797Immunosuppressant drugsALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\nto immunosuppressant drugs in the past should let his orher physician know before taking the drugs again. Thephysician should also be told about any allergies to\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\nPREGNANCY. Azathioprine may cause birth defects\nif used during pregnancy , or if either the male or female\nis using it at time of conception. Anyone taking this med-icine should use a barrier method of birth control, such asa diaphragm or condoms. Birth control pills should notbe used without a physician’s approval. Women whobecome pregnant while taking this medicine shouldcheck with their physicians immediately.\nThe medicine’s effects have not been studied in\nhumans during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant orwho may become pregnant and who need to take thismedicine should check with their physicians.\nBREASTFEEDING. Immunosuppressant drugs pass\ninto breast milk and may cause problems in nursingbabies whose mothers take it. Breastfeeding is not rec-ommended for women taking this medicine.\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. People who have\ncertain medical conditions may have problems if theytake immunosuppressant drugs. For example:\n• People who have shingles (herpes zoster) or chicken-\npox, or who have recently been exposed to chickenpox,\nmay develop severe disease in other parts of their bod-ies when they take these medicines.\n• The medicine’s effects may be greater in people with\nkidney disease or liver disease, because their bodies areslow to get rid of the medicine.\n• The effects of oral forms of this medicine may be\nweakened in people with intestinal problems, becausethe medicine cannot be absorbed into the body.\nBefore using immunosuppressant drugs, people with\nthese or other medical problems should make sure theirphysicians are aware of their conditions.\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking immunosup-\npressant drugs with certain other drugs may affect theway the drugs work or may increase the chance of sideeffects.\nSide effects\nIncreased risk of infection is a common side effect\nof all the immunosuppressant drugs. The immune systemprotects the body from infections and when the immunesystem is suppressed, infections are more likely. Takingantibiotics such as co-trimoxazole prevents some of\nthese infections. Immunosuppressant drugs are also asso-ciated with a slightly increased risk of cancer because\nthe immune system also plays a role in protecting thebody against some forms of cancer. For example, long-term use of immunosuppressant drugs carries anincreased risk of developing skin cancer as a result of thecombination of the drugs and exposure to sunlight.\nOther side effects of immunosuppressant drugs are\nminor and usually go away as the body adjusts to themedicine. These include loss of appetite, nausea or vom-iting, increased hair growth, and trembling or shaking ofthe hands. Medical attention is not necessary unless theseside effects continue or cause problems.\nThe treating physician should be notified immedi-\nately if any of the following side effects occur:\n• unusual tiredness or weakness\n• fever or chills• frequent need to urinate\nInteractions\nImmunosuppressant drugs may interact with other\nmedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or bothdrugs may change or the risk of side effects may begreater. Other drugs may also have an adverse effect onimmunosuppressant therapy. This is particularly impor-tant for patients taking cyclosporin or tacrolimus. Forexample, some drugs can cause the blood levels to rise,while others can cause the blood levels to fall and it isimportant to avoid such contraindicated combinations.Other examples are:\n• The effects of azathioprine may be greater in people\nwho take allopurinol, a medicine used to treat gout.\n• A number of drugs, including female hormones (estro-\ngens), male hormones (androgens), the antifungal drugketoconazole (Nizoral), the ulcer drug cimetidine(Tagamet) and the erythromycins (used to treat infec-\ntions), may increase the effects of cyclosporine.\n• When sirolimus is taken at the same time as cyclo-\nsporin, the blood levels of sirolimus may be increased toa level where there are severe side effects. Althoughthese two drugs are usually used together, the sirolimusshould be taken four hours after the dose of cyclosporin.\n• Tacrolimus is eliminated through the kidneys. When the\ndrug is used with other drugs that may harm the kid-neys, such as cyclosporin, the antibiotics gentamicinand amikacin, or the antifungal drug amphotericin B,blood levels of tacrolimus may be increased. Carefulkidney monitoring is essential when tacrolimus is givenwith any drug that might cause kidney damage.\n• The risk of cancer or infection may be greater when\nimmunosuppressant drugs are combined with certain\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1798Immunosuppressant drugsother drugs which also lower the body’s ability to fight\ndisease and infection. These drugs include corticos-teroids such as prednisone; the anticancer drugs chlo-\nrambucil (Leukeran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) andmercaptopurine (Purinethol); and the monoclonal anti-body muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone), which also isused to prevent transplanted organ rejection.\nNot every drug that may interact with immunosup-\npressant drugs is listed here. Anyone who takes immuno-suppressant drugs should let the physician know all othermedicines he or she is taking and should ask whether thepossible interactions can interfere with treatment.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAbbas, A.

    "title": "Impacted tooth",
    "content": "Impacted tooth\nDefinition\nAn impacted tooth is any tooth that is prevented\nfrom reaching its normal position in the mouth by tissue,bone, or another tooth.\nDescription\nThe teeth that most commonly become impacted are\nthe third molars, also called wisdom teeth. These largeteeth are the last to develop, beginning to form when aperson is about nine years old, but not breaking throughthe gum tissue until the late teens or early twenties. Bythis time, the jaws have stopped growing and may be toosmall to accommodate these four additional teeth. As thewisdom teeth continue to move, one or more maybecome impacted, either by running into the teeth next tothem or becoming blocked within the jawbone or gumtissue. An impacted tooth can cause further dental prob-lems, including infection of the gums, displacement ofother teeth, or decay. At least one wisdom tooth becomesimpacted in nine of every ten people.KEY TERMS\nDry socket —A painful condition following tooth\nextraction in which a blood clot does not properlyfill the empty socket, leaving the bone underneathexposed to air and food.\nEruption —The process of a tooth breaking through\nthe gum tissue to grow into place in the mouth.\nExtraction —The removal of a tooth from its socket\nin the bone.\nPericoronitis —A gum condition in which irritation\nand inflammation are produced by the crown ofan incompletely erupted tooth.\nWisdom tooth —One of the four last teeth on the top\nand bottom rows of teeth. Also called a third molar.\nCauses and Symptoms\nThe movement of an erupting wisdom tooth and any\nsubsequent impaction may produce pain at the back of\nthe jaw. Pain may also be the result of infection, eitherfrom decay in any exposed portion of the tooth or fromtrapped food and plaque in the surrounding gum tissue.Infection typically produces an unpleasant taste whenbiting down and bad breath . Another source of pain may\nbe pericoronitis, a gum condition in which the crown ofthe incompletely erupted tooth produces inflammation,redness, and tenderness of the gums. Less commonsymptoms of an impacted tooth are swollen lymph nodesin the neck, difficulty opening the mouth, and prolongedheadache .\nDiagnosis\nUpon visual examination, the dentist may find signs\nof infection or swelling in the area where the tooth is pre-sent or only partially erupted. Dental x rays are necessaryto confirm tooth impaction.\nTreatment\nBecause impacted teeth may cause dental problems\nwith few if any symptoms to indicate damage, dentistscommonly recommend the removal of all wisdom teeth,preferably while the patient is still a young adult. A den-tist may perform an extraction with forceps and localanesthetic if the tooth is exposed and appears to be easilyremovable in one piece. However, he or she may refer adifficult extraction to an oral surgeon, a specialist whoadministers either nitrous oxide-oxygen (commonly\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1799Impacted toothcalled “laughing gas”), an intravenous sedative, or a gen-\neral anesthetic to alleviate any pain or discomfort duringthe surgical procedure. Extracting an impacted tooth typ-ically requires cutting through gum tissue to expose thetooth, and may require removing portions of bone to freethe tooth. The tooth may have to be removed in pieces tominimize destruction to the surrounding structures. Theextraction site may or may not require one or morestitches to help the incision heal.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis is very good when impacted teeth are\nremoved from young healthy adults without complica-tions. Potential complications include postoperativeinfection, temporary numbness from nerve irritation, jawfracture, and jaw joint pain. An additional conditionwhich may develop is called dry socket: when a bloodclot does not properly form in the empty tooth socket, oris disturbed by an oral vacuum (such as from drinkingthrough a straw or smoking ), the bone beneath the socket\nis painfully exposed to air and food, and the extractionsite heals more slowly.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.\n9700 West Bryn Mawr Ave., Rosemont, IL 60018-5701.(847) 678-6200. <http://www.aaoms.org>.\nBethany Thivierge"

    "title": "Impedance phlebography",
    "content": "Impedance phlebography\nDefinition\nImpedance phlebography is a noninvasive test that\nuses electrical monitoring to measure blood flow in veinsof the leg. Information from this test helps a doctor todetect deep vein thrombosis (blood clots or throm-\nbophlebitis ).\nPurpose\nImpedance phlebography may be done in order to:\n• detect blood clots lodged in the deep veins of the leg\n• screen patients who are likely to have blood clots in the\nleg\n• detect the source of blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary\nemboli)Blood clots in the legs can lead to more serious\nproblems. If a clot breaks loose from a leg vein, it maytravel to the lungs and lodge in a blood vessel in thelungs. Blood clots are more likely to occur in people whohave recently had leg injuries, surgery, cancer , or a long\nperiod of bed rest.\nPrecautions\nBecause this test is not invasive, it can be done on all\npatients. However, the accuracy of the results will beaffected if the patient does not breathe normally or keepthe leg muscles relaxed. Compression of the veinsbecause of pelvic tumors or decreased blood flow, due toshock or any condition that reduces the amount of blood\nthe heart pumps, may also change the test results.\nDescription\nImpedance phlebography works by measuring the\nresistance to the transmission of electrical energy(impedance). This resistance changes depending on thevolume of blood flowing through the veins. By graphingthe impedance, a doctor or technician can tell whether aclot is obstructing blood flow.\nUsing conductive jelly, the examiner puts electrodes\non the patient’s calf. These electrodes are connected to aninstrument called a plethysmograph, which records thechanges in electrical resistance that occur during the test.\nThe patient lies down and raises one leg at a 30°\nangle, so that the calf is above the level of the heart. Theexaminer wraps a pressure cuff around the patient’s thighand inflates it to a pressure of 45–60 cm of water for 45seconds. The plethysmograph records the electricalchanges that correspond to changes in the volume ofblood in the vein at the time the pressure is exerted andagain three seconds after the cuff is deflated. This proce-dure is repeated several times in both legs.\nThis test takes 30–45 minutes. Impedance phlebog-\nraphy is also called an impedance test of blood flow orimpedance plethysmography.\nPreparation\nPatients undergoing this test do not need to alter\ntheir diet, change their normal activities, or stop takingany medications. They will wear a surgical gown duringthe test, and be asked to urinate before the test starts. Ifkeeping the legs elevated causes discomfort, mild pain\nmedication will be given.\nAftercare\nThe patient may resume normal or postoperative\nactivities after the test.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1800Impedance phlebographyRisks\nImpedance phlebography is painless and safe. It pre-\nsents no risk to the patient.\nNormal results\nNormally, inflating the pressure cuff will cause a\nsharp rise in the pressure in the veins of the calf becauseblood flow is blocked. When the cuff is released, thepressure decreases rapidly as the blood flows away.\nAbnormal results\nIf a clot is present, the pressure in the calf veins\nwill already be high. It does not become sharply higherwhen the pressure cuff is tightened. When the pressurecuff is deflated, the clot blocks the flow of blood out ofthe calf vein. The decrease in pressure is not as rapid aswhen no clot is present, and the shape of the resultinggraph is different.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Impedance Plethysmography.” In Illustrated Guide to Diag-\nnostic Tests , ed.

There are two types, bullous and epidemic.KEY TERMS\nThrombophlebitis —Inflammation of a vein, asso-\nciated with the formation of a blood clot.\nDescription\nImpetigo is a skin infection thatwhich tends primari-\nly to afflict children. Impetigo caused by the bacteriumStaphylococcus aureus (also known as staph) affects\nchildren of all ages. Impetigo caused by the bacteriacalled group A streptococci (also know as strep) are mostcommon in children ages two to five.\nThe bacteria that cause impetigo are very conta-\ngious. They can be spread by a child from one part of hisor her body to another by scratching, or contact with atowel, clothing, or stuffed animal. These same methodscan pass the bacteria on from one person to another.\nImpetigo tends to develop in areas of the skin that\nhave already been damaged through some other mecha-nism (a cut or scrape, burn, insect bite, or vesicle fromchickenpox ).\nCauses and symptoms\nThe first sign of bullous impetigo is a large bump on\nthe skin with a clear, fluid-filled top (called a vesicle).The bump develops a scab-like, honey-colored crust.There is usually no redness or pain , although the area\nmay be quite itchy. Ultimately, the skin in this area willbecome dry and flake away. Bullous impetigo is usuallycaused by staph bacteria.\nEpidemic impetigo can be caused by staph or strep\nbacteria, and (as the name implies) is very easilypassed among children. Certain factors, such as heatand humidity, crowded conditions, and poor hygieneincrease the chance that this type of impetigo willspread rapidly among large groups of children. Thistype of impetigo involves the formation of a small\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1801Impetigo\nImpetigo is a contagious bacterial skin infection that mostly\naffects the area around the nose and mouth. Usually causedby staphylococci, this person’s impetigo was triggered byherpes simplex. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by per-\nmission.)vesicle surrounded by a circle of reddened skin. The\nvesicles appear first on the face and legs. When a childhas several of these vesicles close together, they mayspread to one another. The skin surface may becomeeaten away (ulcerated), leaving irritated pits. Whenthere are many of these deep, pitting ulcers, with pus inthe center and brownish-black scabs, the condition iscalled ecthyma. If left untreated, the type of bacteriacausing this type of impetigo has the potential to causea serious kidney disease called glomerulonephritis .\nEven when impetigo is initially caused by strep bacte-ria, the vesicles are frequently secondarily infectedwith staph bacteria.\nImpetigo is usually an uncomplicated skin condi-\ntion. Left untreated, however, it may develop into aserious disease, including osteomyelitis (bone infec-\ntion), septic arthritis (joint infection), or pneumonia . If\nlarge quantities of bacteria are present and begin circu-lating in the bloodstream, the child is in danger ofdeveloping an overwhelming systemic infection knownas sepsis .\nDiagnosis\nCharacteristic appearance of the skin is the usual\nmethod of diagnosis, although fluid from the vesicles canbe cultured and then examined in an attempt to identifythe causative bacteria.\nTreatment\nUncomplicated impetigo is usually treated with a\ntopical antibiotic cream called mupirocin. In more seri-ous, widespread cases of impetigo, or when the child hasa fever or swollen glands, antibiotics may be given by\nmouth or even through a needle placed in a vein (intra-venously).\nPrognosis\nPrognosis for a child with impetigo is excellent.

It is surgically implanted.\nPurpose\nThe implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is used to\ndetect and stop serious ventricular arrhythmias and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1802Implantable cardioverter-defibrillatorrestore a normal heartbeat in people who are at high risk\nof sudden death . The American Heart Association recom-\nmends that implantable cardioverter-defibrillators be con-sidered only for patients who have a life-threateningarrhythmia. A recent study by the National Heart, Lung,and Blood Institute demonstrated that implantable car-dioverter-defibrillators are the treatment of choice insteadof drug therapy for patients who have had a cardiac arrestor heart attack; and are at risk for developing ventricu-\nlar tachycardia , which is a very rapid heartbeat; or ven-\ntricular fibrillation , which is an ineffective, irregular\nheart activity. Other studies suggest that 20% of thesehigh-risk patients would die within two years without animplantable cardioverter-defibrillator. With the device,the five-year risk of sudden death drops to five percent.\nPrecautions\nThe implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should not\nbe used on patients who faint from causes other than aknown life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia; to treatslow heart rates; or during an emergency.\nDescription\nAccording to the American College of Cardiology,\nmore than 80,000 Americans currently have an implantablecardioverter-defibrillator; 17,000 of these were implantedin 1995 alone. The battery-powered device rescues thepatient from a life-threatening arrhythmia by rapid pacingand/or delivering electrical shock(s) to suspend heart activ-ity and then allow the heart to initiate a normal rhythm.Before the development of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, most people who experienced ventricular fib-rillation and weren’t near a hospital with a well-equippedemergency team died within minutes.\nThe implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is like a\nmini-computer connected to the patient’s heart. Newermodels weigh less than 10 ounces and can be implantedbeneath the skin of the chest in the pectoral region with-out major surgery. A lead from the device is then insert-ed into the heart through a vein. The procedure is per-formed in an operating room under general anesthesia.Earlier versions of implantable cardioverter-defibrilla-tors were implanted in the abdomen and required open-chest surgery to connect the electrodes to the left andright ventricles.\nThe implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is set\nabove the patient’s exercise heart rate. Once the device is\nin place, many tests will be conducted to ensure that thedevice is sensing and defibrillating properly. The newerimplantable cardioverter-defibrillators last seven or eightyears. Technology and procedures continue to evolve.Preparation\nBefore the procedure, a complete medical history\nand physical exam will be done. Electrocardiography ,\nspecial electrophysiologic testing, chest x ray ,urinaly-\nsis, and a blood test are usually also required.\nAftercare\nThe patient is monitored for arrhythmias and to\nensure that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator isworking properly. The physician also watches for signsof infection. Before the patient leaves the hospital, thedevice is tested again. Anti-arrhythmia drug therapy isnecessary in more than half of all patients withimplantable cardioverter-defibrillators, but the number ofdrugs and the dosages are usually reduced. Any time asignificant change in anti-arrhythmia medication ismade, the device will be tested again.\nThe patient is taught how the device works, and that\nthe shock it delivers will feel like a punch or kick in thechest. The patient is told to notify his/her physician whenthe implantable cardioverter-defibrillator delivers ashock, and to go to the emergency room if multipleshocks are sent within a short period of time.\nAlthough most patients with implantable cardiovert-\ner-defibrillators are glad that they have the device andfeel that it has extended their lives, they do experiencefear and anxiety . This feeling stems from the sensation\nof the shock(s), the unpredictable circumstances underwhich shock(s) occurs, and unknown outcomes.\nRisks\nThere can be serious complications to the implanta-\ntion of a cardioverter-defibrillator. These include inflam-mation of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart;heart attack; congestive heart failure ; and post-operative\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1803Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator\nX ray of implanted cardioverter-dbfibrillator (Custom Medical\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)stroke . Serious infections can develop in the area around\nthe device while the patient is initially hospitalized or upto several months later. Death due to the device’s failurewhile being tested during surgery is an uncommon risk.The risk of death from the implantation procedure is aboutthe same as that for a pacemaker—less than one percent.There are also potentially serious risks associated with thedevice’s improper functioning once it is in place.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDeBakey, M.

    "title": "Impotence",
    "content": "Impotence\nDefinition\nImpotence, often called erectile dysfunction, refers\nto the male’s inability to achieve or maintain an erectionlong enough to engage in sexual intercourse.\nDescription\nUnder normal circumstances, when a man is sexual-\nly stimulated, his brain sends a message down the spinalcord and into the nerves of the penis. The nerve endingsin the penis release chemical messengers called neuro-transmitters that signal the corpora cavernosa (the twospongy rods of tissue that span the length of the penis) torelax and fill with blood. As they expand, the corporacavernosa close off other veins that would normally drainblood from the penis. As the penis becomes engorgedwith blood, it enlarges and stiffens, causing an erection.Problems with blood vessels, nerves, or tissues of thepenis can interfere with an erection.\nCauses and symptoms\nIt is estimated that up to 30 million American men\nfrequently suffer from impotence and that it strikes up tohalf of all men between the ages of 40 and 70. Doctorsused to think that most cases of impotence were psycho-logical in origin, but they now recognize that, at least inolder men, physical causes may play a primary role in60% or more of all cases. In men over the age of 60, theleading cause is atherosclerosis , or narrowing of the arter-\nies, which can restrict the flow of blood to the penis. Injuryto or disease of the connective tissue, such as Peyronie’s\ndisease , may prevent the corpora cavernosa from com-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1804Impotencepletely expanding. Damage to the nerves of the penis from\ncertain types of surgery or neurological conditions, such asParkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis , may also\ncause impotence. Men with diabetes are especially at riskfor impotence because of their high risk of both athero-sclerosis and a nerve disease called diabetic neuropathy .\nCertain types of blood pressure medications, anti-\nulcer drugs, antihistamines , tranquilizers (especially\nbefore intercourse), antifungals (ketoconazole), antipsy-chotics, antianxiety drugs , and antidepressants, known\nas selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,\nincluding Prozac and Paxil), can interfere with erectilefunction. Smoking , excessive alcohol consumption, and\nillicit drug use may also contribute. In rare cases, lowlevels of the male hormone testosterone may contributeto erectile failure. Finally, such psychological factors asstress , guilt, or anxiety may also play a role, even when\nthe impotence is primarily due to organic causes.\nDiagnosis\nThe doctor also obtains a thorough medical history\nto find out about past pelvic surgery, diabetes, cardiovas-cular disease, kidney disease, and any medications theman may be taking. The physical examination should\ninclude a genital examination, a measurement of bloodflow through the penis, hormone tests, and a glucose testfor diabetes.\nIn some cases, nocturnal penile tumescence testing is\nperformed to find out whether the man has erections whileasleep. Healthy men usually have about four or five erec-tions throughout the night. The man applies a device to thepenis called a Rigiscan before going to bed at night, andthe device can determine whether he has had erections. (Ifa man is able to have normal erections at night, this findingsuggests a psychological cause for his impotence.)\nTreatment\nYears ago, the standard treatment for impotence was\nan implantable penile prosthesis or long-term psychother-apy. Although physical causes are now more readily diag-nosed and treated, individual or marital counseling is stillan effective treatment for impotence when emotional fac-tors play a role. Fortunately, other approaches are nowavailable to treat the physical causes of impotence.\nThe first line and by far the most common treatment\ntoday is the prescription drug sildenafil citrate , sold\nunder the brand name Viagra. An estimated 20 millionprescriptions for the pill have been filled since it wasapproved by the FDA in March 1998. It is also the mosteffective treatment, with a success rate of more than60%. The drug boosts levels of a substance called cyclicGMP, which is responsible for widening the blood ves-KEY TERMS\nAlprostadil —A smooth muscle relaxant some-\ntimes injected into the penis or applied to the ure-thral opening to treat impotence.\nAtherosclerosis —A disorder in which plaques of\ncholesterol, lipids, and other debris build up onthe inner walls of arteries, narrowing them.\nCorpora cavernosa —Rods of spongy tissue found\nwithin the penis, which become engorged withblood in order to produce an erection. (The singu-lar form of this term is corpus cavernosum.)\nNeurotransmitters —Chemicals that modify or\nhelp transmit impulses between nerve synapses.\nPapaverine —A smooth muscle relaxant some-\ntimes injected into the penis as a treatment forimpotence.\nPeyronie’s disease —A disease resulting from scar-\nring of the corpora cavernosa, causing painfulerections.\nUrethra —The small tube that drains urine from\nthe bladder, as well as serving as a conduit forsemen during ejaculation.\nViagra —An orally administered drug for erectile\nfailure first cleared for marketing in the UnitedStates in March 1998.\nsels of the penis. In clinical studies, Viagra produced\nheadaches in 16% of men who took it, and other sideeffects included flushing, indigestion , and stuffy nose.\nThe primary drawback to Viagra, which works about\nan hour after it is taken, is that the FDA cautions menwith heart disease or low blood pressure to be thoroughlyexamined by a physician before obtaining a prescription.\nA second impotence drug, apomorphine, failed to\nreceive FDA approval in 2000 after tests showed it wasassociated with an unacceptable risk of heart disease. Atleast four other impotence drugs are in development andcould be on the market by 2002.\nAnother approach is vacuum therapy. The man\ninserts his penis into a clear plastic cylinder and uses apump to force air out of the cylinder. This forms a partialvacuum around the penis, which helps to draw blood intothe corpora cavernosa. The man then places a specialring over the base of the penis to trap the blood inside it.The only side effect with this type of treatment is occa-sional bruising if the vacuum is left on too long.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1805ImpotenceInjection therapy involves injecting a substance into\nthe penis to enhance blood flow and cause an erection.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved adrug called alprostadil (Caverject) for this purpose inJuly of 1995. Alprostadil relaxes smooth muscle tissue toenhance blood flow into the penis. It must be injectedshortly before intercourse. Another, similar drug that issometimes used is papaverine—not yet approved by theFDA for this use. Either drug may sometimes causepainful erections or priapism (uncomfortable, prolonged\nerections) that must be treated with a shot of epinephrine.\nAlprostadil may also be administered into the ure-\nthral opening of the penis. In MUSE (medical urethralsystem for erection), the man inserts a thin tube the widthof a vermicelli noodle into his urethral opening andpresses down on a plunger to deliver a tiny pellet con-taining alprostadil into his penis. The drug takes about 10minutes to work and the erection lasts about an hour. Themain side effect is a sensation of pain and burning in the\nurethra, which can last about five to 15 minutes.\nImplantable penile prostheses are usually considered\na last resort for treating impotence. They are implanted inthe corpora cavernosa to make the penis rigid without theneed for blood flow. The semirigid type of prosthesis con-sists of a pair of flexible silicone rods that can be bent upor down. This type of device has a low failure rate but,unfortunately, it causes the penis to always be erect, whichcan be difficult to conceal under clothing.\nThe inflatable type of device consists of cylinders\nthat are implanted in the corpora cavernosa, a fluid reser-voir implanted in the abdomen, and a pump placed in thescrotum. The man squeezes the pump to move fluid intothe cylinders and cause them to become rigid. (He revers-es the process by squeezing the pump again.) While thesedevices allow for intermittent erections, they have aslightly higher malfunction rate than the silicon rods.\nMen can return to sexual activity six to eight weeks\nafter implantation surgery. Since implants affect the cor-pora cavernosa, they permanently take away a man’sability to have a natural erection.\nIn rare cases, if narrowed or diseased veins are\nresponsible for impotence, surgeons may reroute the bloodflow into the corpus cavernosa or remove leaking vessels.However, the success rate with these procedures has beenvery low, and they are still considered experimental.\nAlternative treatment\nA number of herbs have been promoted for treating\nimpotence. The most widely touted herbs for this pur-pose are Coryanthe yohimbe (available by prescription\nas yohimbine, with the trade name Yocon) and gingko(Gingko biloba ), although neither has been conclusively\nshown to help the condition in controlled studies. Inaddition, gingko carries some risk of abnormal bloodclotting and should be avoided by men taking suchblood thinners as coumadin. Other herbs promoted fortreating impotence include true unicorn root ( Aletrius\nfarinosa ),saw palmetto (Serenoa repens ), ginseng\n(Panax ginseng ), and Siberian ginseng ( Eleuthrococcus\nsenticosus ). Strychnos Nux vomica has been recom-\nmended, especially when impotence is caused by exces-sive alcohol, cigarettes, or dietary indiscretions, but itcan be very toxic if taken improperly, so it should beused only under the strict supervision of a physiciantrained in its use.\nPrognosis\nWith proper diagnosis, impotence can nearly always\nbe treated or managed successfully. Unfortunately, fewerthan 10% of impotent men seek treatment.\nPrevention\nThere is no specific treatment to prevent impotence.\nPerhaps the most important measure is to maintain gen-eral good health and avoid atherosclerosis by exercisingregularly, controlling weight, controlling hypertension\nand high cholesterol levels, and avoiding smoking.\nAvoiding excessive alcohol intake may also help.\nResources\nBOOKS\nRyan, George.

    "content": "Impulse control disorders\nDefinition\nImpulse control disorders are characterized by an\ninability to resist the impulse to perform an action that isharmful to one’s self or others. This is a relatively newclass of personality disorders . The most common of\nthese are intermittent explosive disorder , kleptomania,\npyromania, compulsive gambling disorder, and trichotil-lomania.\nDescription\nAll of these impulse control disorders involve the\nloss or lack of control in certain specific situations. Thehallmark of these disorders is the individual’s inability tocontrol impulses that may cause harm to themselves orothers. Affected individuals often feel anxiety or tension\nin considering these behaviors. This anxiety or tension isrelieved or diminished once the action is performed.\nIntermittent explosive disorder is more common\namong men, and involves aggressive outbursts that leadto assaults on others or destruction of property. Theseoutburst are unprovoked, or seem to be out of proportionto the event that precedes them.\nKleptomania is more common among women, and\ninvolves the theft of objects that are seemingly worthless.The act of stealing relieves tension and is seen by theindividually to be rewarding. The actual stealing is notpreplanned, and the concept of punishment for the crimedoesn’t occur to these individuals—although they areaware that what they are doing is wrong.\nPyromania is more common among men, and\ninvolves setting fires in order to feel pleasure andrelieve tension.\nPathological gambling occurs in roughly 1-3% of\nthe population, and involves excessive gambling despiteheavy monetary losses. These losses actually act as amotivating factor in continuing gambling in order torecoup some of what was lost.\nTrichotillomania involves pulling hair from one’s\nown scalp, face, or body, and is more common inwomen.KEY TERMS\nCompulsive gambling disorder —An impulse con-\ntrol disorder in which an individual cannot resistgambling despite repeated losses.\nIntermittent explosive disorder —A personality\ndisorder in which an individual is prone to inter-mittent explosive episodes of aggression, duringwhich he or she causes bodily harm or destroysproperty.\nKleptomania —An impulse control disorder in\nwhich one steals objects that are of little or novalue.\nPyromania —An impulse control disorder in which\none sets fires.\nTrichotillomania —An impulse or compulsion to\ntug or pull on one’s own hair.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact causes of impulse control disorders are\nstill unknown. Individuals who have had serious headinjuries, however, can be at a higher risk for developingimpulse control disorders, as are persons with epilepsy.\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis of any of these impulse control disor-\nders can be made only after all other medical and psychi-atric disorders that may cause the same symptoms havebeen ruled out.\nIntermittent explosive disorder involves severe acts\nof assault or destruction of property. The aggression seenduring these acts is vastly out of proportion to events thatmay seem to have precipitated the acts.\nKleptomania involves stealing objects that are\nunnecessary and of little monetary value. The act ofstealing is not an expression of anger or vengeance.Again, there is an increased tension before the act iscommitted, and this is resolved or relieved once theobject is stolen.\nPyromania is classified by the deliberate and\nrepeated setting of fires. The individual will exhibit afascination and attraction to fire and any objects asso-ciated with it. Before the fire is set, there is tension,with a resolving relief once the fire is set. Acts of truepyromania are not done for monetary gain, to expressanger, to conceal criminal behavior, or in response tohallucination.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1807Impulse control disordersPathological gambling is a disorder to gamble\ndespite continuing losses and monetary insufficiency.This disorder typically begins in youth. Affected individ-uals are often competitive, easily bored, restless, andgenerous.\nFor a diagnosis of pathological gambling, five or\nmore of the following symptoms must be present:\n• a preoccupation with gambling\n• a need to gamble with more money to achieve the\n“thrill” of winning\n• repeated attempts to control or stop gambling\n• irritability or restlessness due to repeated attempts at\ncontrol\n• gambling as an escape from stress\n• lying to cover up gambling\n• conducting illegal activities, such as embezzling or\nfraud, to finance gambling\n• losing a job or personal relationship due to gambling• borrowing money to fund gambling\nTrichotillomania is the continuous pulling or tug-\nging on one’s own hair. Again, there is an increased senseof tension before pulling the hair, which is relieved onceit is pulled out. Recurrent pulling out of one’s hair result-ing in noticeable hair loss. Affected individuals canundergo significant distress and impaired social, occupa-tional, and functional behavior.\nTreatment\nA combination of psychological counseling and\nmedication are the preferred treatments for impulse con-trol disorders. For kleptomania, pyromania, and trichotil-lomania, behavior modification is usually the treatmentof choice. For pathological gambling, treatment usuallyinvolves an adaptation of the model set forth by Alco-holics Anonymous. Individuals are counseled with thegoal of eventual response to appropriate social limits. Inthe case of intermittent explosive disorder, anger man-agement and medication may be used in extreme cases ofaggression.\nPrognosis\nThese disorders can usually be controlled with med-\nication, although it may need to be continued long-termto help prevent further aggressive outbursts. Long-termcounseling is usually necessary as well. Support groupsand meetings may also help these individuals.\nThe prognosis for intermittent explosive disorder,\nkleptomania, and pyromania is fair. Little is known aboutthe prognosis for trichotillomania, and studies have\nshown that the condition can disappear for long periods(months to years) without any psychological counseling.For pathological gambling, the prognosis varies greatlyfrom person to person. While total cure for this conditionis unlikely, much like alcoholism , long periods of absti-\nnence or continuous abstinence are possible.\nPrevention\nThere are no known preventive treatments or mea-\nsures for impulse control disorders.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nHollander, E., A.

    "title": "In vitro fertilization",
    "content": "In vitro fertilization\nDefinition\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a procedure in which eggs\n(ova) from a woman’s ovary are removed. They are fertil-ized with sperm in a laboratory procedure, and then the fer-tilized egg (embryo) is returned to the woman’s uterus.\nPurpose\nIVF is one of several assisted reproductive tech-\nniques (ART) used to help infertile couples to conceive achild. If after one year of having sexual intercourse with-out the use of birth control a woman is unable to getpregnant, infertility is suspected. Some of the reasons\nfor infertility include damaged or blocked fallopiantubes, hormonal imbalance, or endometriosis in the\nwoman. In the man, low sperm count or poor qualitysperm can cause infertility.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1808In vitro fertilizationIVF is one of several possible methods to increase\nthe chance for an infertile couple to become pregnant. Itsuse depends on the reason for infertility. IVF may be anoption if there is a blockage in the fallopian tubes orendometriosis in the woman or low sperm count or poorquality sperm in the man. There are other possible treat-ments for these conditions, such as surgery for blockedtubes or endometriosis, which may be tried before IVF.\nIVF will not work for a woman who is not capable\nof ovulating or a man who is not able to produce at leasta few healthy sperm.\nPrecautions\nThe screening procedures and treatments for infertili-\nty can become a long, expensive, and sometimes disap-pointing process. Each IVF attempt takes at least an entiremenstrual cycle and can cost $5000–$10,000, which mayor may not be covered by health insurance. The anxiety\nof dealing with infertility can challenge both individualsand their relationship. The added stress and expense of\nmultiple clinic visits, testing, treatments, and surgical pro-cedures can become overwhelming. Couples may want toreceive counseling and support through the process.\nDescription\nIn vitro fertilization is a procedure in which the join-\ning of egg and sperm takes place outside the woman’sbody. A woman may be given fertility drugs before thisprocedure so that several eggs mature in the ovaries atthe same time. Eggs (ova) are removed from a woman’sovaries using a long, thin needle. The physician getsaccess to the ovaries using one of two possible proce-dures. One procedure involves inserting the needlethrough the vagina (transvaginally). The physicianguides the needle to the location of the ovaries with thehelp of an ultrasound machine. In the other procedure,called laparoscopy , a small thin tube with a viewing lens\nis inserted through an incision in the navel. This allowsthe physician to see inside the patient and locate theovaries on a video monitor.\nOnce the eggs are removed, they are mixed with\nsperm in a laboratory dish or test tube. (This is the originof the term test tube baby .) The eggs are monitored for\nseveral days. Once there is evidence that fertilization hasoccurred and the cells begin to divide, they are thenreturned to the woman’s uterus.\nIn the procedure to remove eggs, enough may be\ngathered to be frozen and saved (either fertilized orunfertilized) for additional IVF attempts.\nIVF has been used successfully since 1978, when the\nfirst child to be conceived by this method was born in Eng-KEY TERMS\nFallopian tubes —In a woman’s reproductive sys-\ntem, a pair of narrow tubes that carry the egg fromthe ovary to the uterus.\nGIFT —Stands for gamete intrafallopian tube trans-\nfer.

The procedure may beused if the male has a low sperm count.\nZIFT—Stands for zygote intrafallopian tube trans-\nfer. In this form of in vitro fertilization, the eggs arefertilized in a laboratory dish and then placed inthe woman’s fallopian tube.\nland. Over the past 20 years, thousands of couples have\nused this method of ART or similar procedures to conceive.\nOther types of assisted reproductive technologies\nmight be used to achieve pregnancy . A procedure called\nintracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) uses a manipula-tion technique that must be performed using a micro-scope to inject a single sperm into each egg. The fertil-ized eggs can then be returned to the uterus as in IVF. Ingamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT) the eggs andsperm are mixed in a narrow tube and then deposited inthe fallopian tube, where fertilization normally takesplace. Another variation on IVF is zygote intrafallopiantube transfer (ZIFT). As in IVF, the fertilization of theeggs occurs in a laboratory dish. And, similar to GIFT,the embryos are placed in the fallopian tube (rather thanthe uterus as with IVF).\nPreparation\nOnce a woman is determined to be a good candidate\nfor in vitro fertilization, she will generally be given “fer-tility drugs” to stimulate ovulation and the developmentof multiple eggs. These drugs may include gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), Pergonal, Clomid,or human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). The maturationof the eggs is then monitored with ultrasound tests andfrequent blood tests. If enough eggs mature, the physi-cian will perform the procedure to remove them. Thewoman may be given a sedative prior to the procedure. Alocal anesthetic may also be used to reduce discomfortduring the procedure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1809In vitro fertilizationAftercare\nAfter the IVF procedure is performed the woman\ncan resume normal activities. A pregnancy test can bedone approximately 12–14 days later to determine if theprocedure was successful.\nRisks\nThe risks associated with in vitro fertilization\ninclude the possibility of multiple pregnancy (since\nseveral embryos may be implanted) and ectopic preg-\nnancy (an embryo that implants in the fallopian tube or\nin the abdominal cavity outside the uterus). There is aslight risk of ovarian rupture, bleeding, infections, andcomplications of anesthesia. If the procedure is success-ful and pregnancy is achieved, the pregnancy wouldcarry the same risks as any pregnancy achieved withoutassisted technology.\nNormal results\nSuccess rates vary widely between clinics and\nbetween physicians performing the procedure. A couplehas about a 10% chance of becoming pregnant eachtime the procedure is performed. Therefore, the proce-dure may have to be repeated more than once to achievepregnancy.\nAbnormal results\nAn ectopic or multiple pregnancy may abort sponta-\nneously or may require termination if the health of themother is at risk.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Assisted Reproductive Technologies.” In The Merck Manual.\n16th ed.

    "content": "Inclusion conjunctivitis\nDefinition\nInclusion conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the\nconjunctiva (the membrane that lines the eyelids andcovers the white part, or sclera, of the eyeball) byChlamydia trachomatis . Chlamydia is a sexually trans-\nmitted organism.\nDescription\nInclusion conjunctivitis, known as neonatal inclu-\nsion conjunctivitis in the newborn and adult inclusionconjunctivitis in the adult, is also called inclusion blenn-orrhea, chlamydial conjunctivitis, or swimming poolconjunctivitis. This disease affects four of 1,000 (0.4%)live births. Approximately half of the infants born tountreated infected mothers will develop the disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nInclusion conjunctivitis in the newborn results from\npassage through an infected birth canal and develops fiveto 14 days after birth. Both eyelids and conjunctivae areswollen. There may be a discharge of pus from the eyes.\nMost instances of adult inclusion conjunctivitis\nresult from exposure to infected genital secretions. It istransmitted to the eye by fingers and occasionally by thewater in swimming pools, poorly chlorinated hot tubs, orby sharing makeup. In adult inclusion conjunctivitis, oneeye is usually involved, with a stringy discharge ofmucus and pus. There may be little bumps called folliclesinside the lower eyelid and the eye is red. Occasionally,the condition damages the cornea, causing cloudy areasand a growth of new blood vessels (neovascularization).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1810Inclusion conjunctivitisDiagnosis\nInclusion conjunctivitis is usually considered when\nthe patient has a follicular conjunctivitis that will not goaway, even after using topical antibiotics . Diagnosis\ndepends upon tests performed on the discharge from theeye. Gram stains determine the type of microorganism,while culture and sensitivity tests determine whichantibiotic will kill the harmful microorganism. Conjunc-tival scraping determines whether chlamydia is present incells taken from the conjunctiva.\nTreatment\nTreatment in the newborn consists of administration\nof tetracycline ointment to the conjunctiva and ery-thromycin orally or through intravenous therapy for four-teen days. The mother should be treated for cervicitis\nand the father for urethritis , even if they do not have\nsymptoms of these diseases.\nIn adults, tetracycline ointment or drops should be\napplied to the conjunctiva and oral tetracycline, amox-acillin, or erythromycin should be taken for three weeks,or doxycycline for one week.\nPatients should have weekly checkups so that the\ndoctor can monitor the healing.\nOral tetracycline should not be administered to chil-\ndren whose permanent teeth have not erupted. It shouldalso not be given to nursing or pregnant women.\nPrognosis\nUntreated inclusion conjunctivitis in the newborn per-\nsists for three to 12 months and usually heals; however, theremay be scarring or neovascularization. In the adult, if leftuntreated, the disease may continue for months and causecorneal neovascularization. Even if the disease is treated,antibiotics usually do not reverse damage that may haveoccurred, but they may help prevent it if given early enough.\nPrevention\nThe neonatal infection may be prevented by instill-\ning erythromycin ointment in the conjunctival cul-de-sacat birth. It is not prevented by silver nitrate.\nChlamydia is a contagious, sexually transmitted dis-\nease.

    "content": "Incompetent cervix\nDefinition\nA cervix (the structure at the bottom of the uterus)\nthat is incompetent is abnormally weak, and therefore itcan gradually widen during pregnancy . Left untreated,\nthis can result in repeated pregnancy losses or prematuredelivery.\nDescription\nIncompetent cervix is the result of an anatomical\nabnormality. Normally, the cervix remains closedthroughout pregnancy until labor begins. An incompetentcervix gradually opens due to the pressure from thedeveloping fetus after about the 13th week of pregnancy.The cervix begins to thin out and widen without any con-tractions or labor. The membranes surrounding the fetusbulge down into the opening of the cervix until theybreak, resulting in the loss of the baby or a very prema-ture delivery.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1811Incompetent cervixCauses and symptoms\nSome factors that can contribute to the chance of a\nwoman having an incompetent cervix include trauma tothe cervix, physical abnormality of the cervix, or havingbeen exposed to the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) in themother’s womb. Some women have cervical incompe-tence for no obvious reason.\nDiagnosis\nIncompetent cervix is suspected when a woman has\nthree consecutive spontaneous pregnancy losses duringthe second trimester (the fourth, fifth and sixth months ofthe pregnancy). The likelihood of this happening by ran-dom chance is less than 1%. Spontaneous losses due toincompetent cervix account for 20–25% of all secondtrimester losses. A spontaneous second trimester preg-nancy loss is different from a miscarriage , which usual-\nly happens during the first three months of pregnancy.\nThe physician can check for abnormalities in the\ncervix by performing a manual examination or by anultrasound test. The physician can also check to see if thecervix is prematurely widened (dilated). Because incom-petent cervix is only one of several potential causes forthis, the patient’s past history of pregnancy losses mustalso be considered when making the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment for incompetent cervix is a surgical pro-\ncedure called cervical cerclage. A stitch (suture) is usedto tie the cervix shut to give it more support. It is mosteffective if it is performed somewhere between 14 and 16weeks into the pregnancy. The stitch is removed near theend of pregnancy to allow for a normal birth.KEY TERMS\nDiethylstilbestrol (DES) —DES is a drug given to\nwomen a generation ago to prevent miscarriage. Atthat time it was not known that female childrenborn of women who had been given DES wouldshow a higher rate for cervical and other reproduc-tive abnormalities, as well as a rare form of vaginalcancer, when they reached reproductive age.\nEffacement —The thinning out of the cervix that\nnormally occurs along with dilation shortly beforedelivery.\nPreterm labor —Labor before the thirty-seventh\nweek of pregnancy.Cervical cerclage can be performed under spinal,\nepidural, or general anesthesia. The patient will need tostay in the hospital for one or more days. The procedureto remove the suture is done without the need for anes-thesia. The vagina is held open with an instrument calleda speculum and the stitch is cut and removed. This maybe slightly uncomfortable, but should not be painful.\nSome possible risks of cerclage are premature rup-\nture of the amniotic membranes, infection of the amniot-ic sac, and preterm labor. The risk of infection of theamniotic sac increases as the pregnancy progresses. For acervix that is dilated 3 centimeters (cm), the risk is 30%.\nAfter cerclage, a woman will be monitored for any\npreterm labor. The woman needs to consult her obstetri-cian immediately if there are any signs of contractions.\nCervical cerclage can not be performed if a woman\nis more than 4 cm dilated, if the fetus has already died inher uterus, or if her amniotic membranes are torn and herwater has broken.\nPrognosis\nThe success rate for cerclage correction of incompe-\ntent cervix is good. About 80–90% of the time womendeliver healthy infants. The success rate is higher for cer-clage done early in pregnancy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBarber, Hugh R. K., David H. Fields, and Sherwin A.

    "content": "Indigestion\nDefinition\nIndigestion, which is sometimes called dyspepsia ,i s\na general term covering a group of nonspecific symptomsin the digestive tract. It is often described as a feeling offullness, bloating, nausea, heartburn , or gassy discom-\nfort in the chest or abdomen. The symptoms develop dur-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1812Indigestioning meals or shortly afterward. In most cases, indigestion\nis a minor problem that often clears up without profes-sional treatment.\nDescription\nIndigestion or dyspepsia is a widespread condition,\nestimated to occur in 25% of the adult population of theUnited States. Most people with indigestion do not feelsick enough to see a doctor; nonetheless, it is a commonreason for office visits. About 3% of visits to primarycare doctors are for indigestion.\nCauses and symptoms\nPhysical causes\nThe symptoms associated with indigestion have a\nvariety of possible physical causes, ranging from com-monplace food items to serious systemic disorders:\n• Diet. Milk, milk products, alcoholic beverages, tea, and\ncoffee cause indigestion in some people because theystimulate the stomach’s production of acid.\n• Medications. Certain prescription drugs as well as over-\nthe- counter medications can irritate the stomach lining.These medications include aspirin , NSAIDs, some\nantibiotics , digoxin, theophylline, corticosteroids ,\niron (ferrous sulfate), oral contraceptives , and tricyclic\nantidepressants.\n• Disorders of the pancreas and gallbladder. These\ninclude inflammation of the gallbladder or pancreas,cancer of the pancreas, and gallstones .\n• Intestinal parasites. Parasitic infections that cause indi-\ngestion include amebiasis , fluke and tapeworm infec-\ntions, giardiasis , and strongyloidiasis.\n• Systemic disorders, including diabetes, thyroid disease,\ncollagen vascular disease.\n• Cancers of the digestive tract.• Conditions associated with women’s reproductive\norgans. These conditions include menstrual cramps,pregnancy , and pelvic inflammatory disease.\nPsychologic and emotional causes\nIndigestion often accompanies an emotional upset,\nbecause the part of the nervous system involved in theso-called “fight-or-flight” response also affects the diges-tive tract. People diagnosed with anxiety or somatoform\ndisorders frequently have problems with indigestion.\nMany people in the general population, however, willalso experience heartburn, “butterflies in the stomach,”or stomach cramps when they are in upsetting situa-tions—such as school examinations, arguments withfamily members, crises in their workplace, and so on.\nSome people’s digestive systems appear to react moreintensely to emotional stress due to hypersensitive nerve\nendings in their intestinal tract.\nSpecific gastrointestinal disorders\nIn some cases, the patient’s description of the symp-\ntoms suggests a specific digestive disorder as the causeof the indigestion. Some doctors classify these cases intothree groups:\nESOPHAGITIS TYPE. Esophagitis is an inflammation\nof the tube that carries food from the throat to the stom-ach (the esophagus). The tissues of the esophagus canbecome irritated by the flow (reflux) of stomach acidbackward into the lower part of the esophagus. If thepatient describes the indigestion in terms of frequent orintense heartburn, the doctor will consider gastroe-sophageal reflux disease (GERD) as a possible cause.GERD is a common disorder in the general population,affecting about 30% of adults.\nPEPTIC ULCER TYPE. Patients who smoke and are\nover 45 are more likely to have indigestion of the pepticulcer type. This group also includes people who find thattheir indigestion is relieved by taking antacids or eating\na small amount of food. Patients in this category areoften found to have Helicobacter pylori infections. H.\npylori is a rod-shaped bacterium that lives in the tissues\nof the stomach and causes irritation of the mucous liningof the stomach walls. Most people with H. pylori infec-\ntions do not develop chronic indigestion, but the organ-ism appears to cause peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in a vul-nerable segment of the population.\nNONULCER TYPE. Most cases of chronic indigestion—\nas many as 65%—fall into this third category. Nonulcerdyspepsia is sometimes called functional dyspepsiabecause it appears to be related to abnormalities in the waythat the stomach empties its contents into the intestine. Insome people, the stomach empties either too slowly or toorapidly. In others, the stomach’s muscular contractions areirregular and uncoordinated. These disorders of stomachmovement (motility) may be caused by hypersensitivenerve endings in the stomach tissues. Patients in this groupare likely to be younger than 45 and have a history of tak-ing medications for anxiety or depression.\nDiagnosis\nPatient history\nBecause indigestion is a nonspecific set of symp-\ntoms, patients who feel sick enough to seek medicalattention are likely to go to their primary care doctor. The\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1813Indigestionhistory does not always point to an obvious diagnosis.\nThe doctor can, however, use the process of history-tak-ing to evaluate the patient’s mood or emotional state inorder to assess the possibility of a psychiatric distur-bance. In addition, asking about the location, intensity,timing, and recurrence of the indigestion can help thedoctor weigh the different diagnostic possibilities.\nAn important part of the history-taking is asking\nabout symptoms that may indicate a serious illness.These warning symptoms include:\n• weight loss\n• persistent vomiting\n• difficulty or pain in swallowing\n• vomiting blood or passing blood in the stools• anemia\nImaging studies\nIf the doctor thinks that the indigestion should be\ninvestigated further, he or she will order an endoscopicexamination of the stomach. An endoscope is a slendertube-shaped instrument that allows the doctor to look atthe lining of the patient’s stomach. If the patient has indi-gestion of the esophagitis type or nonulcer type, thestomach lining will appear normal. If the patient hasPUD, the doctor will be able to see breaks or ulceratedareas in the tissue. He or she may also order ultrasoundimaging of the abdomen, or a radionuclide scan to evalu-ate the motility of the stomach.\nLaboratory tests\nBLOOD TESTS. If the patient is over 45, the doctor will\nhave the patient’s blood analyzed for a complete blood cellcount, measurements of liver enzyme levels, electrolyteand serum calcium levels, and thyroid function.\nTESTS FOR HELICOBACTER PYLORI .Doctors can now\ntest patients for the presence of H. pylori without having to\ntake a tissue sample from the stomach. One of these non-invasive tests is a blood test and the other is a breath test.\nTreatment\nSince most cases of indigestion are not caused by seri-\nous disorders, many doctors prefer to try medications andother treatment measures before ordering an endoscopy.\nDiet and stress management\nMany patients benefit from the doctor’s reassurance\nthat they do not have a serious or fatal disorder. Cuttingout alcoholic beverages and drinks containing caffeine\noften helps. The patient may also be asked to keep arecord of food intake, daily schedule, and symptom\nseverity. Food diaries sometimes reveal psychologic ordietary factors that influence indigestion.\nMedications\nPatients with the esophagitis type of indigestion are\noften treated with H\n2antagonists. H2antagonists are\ndrugs that block the secretion of stomach acid. Theyinclude ranitidine (Zantac) and famotidine (Pepcid).\nPatients with motility disorders may be given proki-\nnetic drugs. Prokinetic medications speed up the empty-ing of the stomach and increase intestinal motility. Theyinclude metoclopramide (Reglan) and cisapride (Propul-sid). These drugs relieve symptoms in 60-80% of patients.\nRemoval of H. pylori\nIt is not clear that patients with H. pylori infections\nwho have notdeveloped gastric ulcers need to have the\nbacterium removed. Some studies indicate, however, thatthese patients may benefit from antibiotic therapy.\nAlternative treatment\nHerbal medicine\nPractitioners of Chinese traditional herbal medicine\nmight recommend medicines derived from peony ( Paeo-\nnia lactiflora ), hibiscus ( Hibiscus sabdariffa ), or hare’s ear\n(Bupleurum chinense ) to treat indigestion. Western herbal-\nists are likely to prescribe fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare ),\nlemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ), or peppermint ( Mentha\npiperita ) to relieve stomach cramps and heartburn.\nHomeopathy\nHomeopaths tailor their remedies to the patient’s\noverall personality profile as well as the specific symp-toms. Depending on the patient’s reaction to the indiges-tion and some of its likely causes, the homeopath mightchoose Gelsemium (Gelsemium sempervirens ),Carbo\nvegetalis ,Nux vomica , or Pulsatilla (Pulsatilla nigricans ).\nOther treatments\nSome alternative treatments are aimed at lowering\nthe patient’s stress level or changing attitudes and beliefsthat contribute to indigestion. These therapies and prac-tices include Reiki ,reflexology ,hydrotherapy , thera-\npeutic massage, yoga , and meditation .\nPrognosis\nMost cases of mild indigestion do not need medical\ntreatment. For patients who consult a doctor and are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1814Indigestiongiven an endoscopic examination, 5–15% are diagnosed\nwith GERD and 15–25% with PUD. About 1% ofpatients who are endoscoped have stomach cancer .\nMost patients with functional dyspepsia do well on eitherH\n2antagonists or prokinetic drugs, depending on the\ncause of their indigestion.\nPrevention\nIndigestion can often be prevented by attention to\none’s diet, general stress level, and ways of managingstress. Specific preventive measures include:\n• stop smoking\n• cutting down on or eliminating alcohol, tea, or coffee• avoiding foods that are highly spiced or loaded with fatKEY TERMS\nDyspepsia —Another name for indigestion.\nEndoscope —A slender tubular instrument used to\nexamine the inside of the stomach.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) —A dis-\norder of the lower end of the esophagus, causedby stomach acid flowing backward into the esoph-agus and irritating the tissues.\nH\n2antagonist —A type of drug that relieves indiges-\ntion by reducing the production of stomach acid.\nHeartburn —A popular term for an uncomfortable\nburning sensation in the stomach and loweresophagus, sometimes caused by the reflux ofsmall amounts of stomach acid.\nHelicobacter pylori —A gram-negative rod-shaped\nbacterium that lives in the tissues of the stomachand causes inflammation of the stomach lining.\nMotility —The movement or capacity for move-\nment of an organism or body organ.

Thisusually means that labor is induced if the pregnancy haslasted more than 42 weeks. Labor is also induced if themother is suffering from diseases (preeclampsia, chronichypertension ); if there is an Rh blood incompatibility\nbetween the baby and the mother; or if the mother or babyhas a medical problem that requires delivery of the baby(like a premature rupture of the membranes).\nDescription\nThe uterus is the hollow female organ that supports\nthe development and nourishment of the unborn babyduring pregnancy. Sometimes labor is induced by therupturing the amniotic membrane to release amnioticfluid. This is an attempt to mimic the normal process of“breaking water” that occurs early in the normal birthprocess. This method is sometimes enough stimulation toinduce contractions in the mother’s uterus. If labor failsto start, drugs are used.\nMost labor is induced by using the drug Pitocin, a\nsynthetic form of oxytocin. Oxytocin is a natural hor-mone produced in the body by the pituitary gland. Duringnormal labor, oxytocin causes contractions. When labordoes not occur naturally, the doctor may give the motherPitocin to start the contractions. Pitocin makes the uteruscontract with strength and force almost immediately. Thisdrug is given through a vein in a steady flow that allowsthe doctor to control the amount the mother is given.\nSometimes vaginal gels are used to induce labor.\nNormally, the baby will pass through the opening of theuterus (the cervix) into the birth canal during delivery.Because of this, the cervix softens and begins to enlarge(dilate) during the early part of labor to make room for thebaby to pass through. The cervix will continue to dilate,and the contractions will eventually push the baby out ofthe mother’s body. When labor needs to be induced, thecervix is often small, hard, and not ready for the process.The doctor may need to prepare or “ripen” the cervix toinduce labor. The hormone prostaglandin in a gel formmay be applied high in the vagina to soften and dilate thecervix, making the area ready for labor. This may beenough to stimulate contractions on its own. More often,prostaglandin gel is used in conjunction with Pitrocin.\nIf all attempts to induce labor fail, a cesarean sec-\ntion is performed.\nRisks\nOnce labor has been induced, the unborn baby is mon-\nitored to guard against a reduction in its oxygen supply, orhypoxia. The drugs used to induce labor cause vasocon-striction, which can decrease blood supply to the unborn\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1816Induction of laborbaby. Throughout the process, the baby’s heart rate is mon-\nitored by an electronic device placed on top of the mother’sabdomen. The heart rate is one sign that the unborn baby isgetting enough oxygen and remains healthy. Once themembranes are broken, prolonged labor may result ininfection for either the newborn or the mother.\nNormal results\nOnce labor is induced and the cervix has dilated, labor\nusually proceeds normally.

Medical profes-sionals caring for infants might also use massage tech-niques on infants born prematurely, on those with motoror gastrointestinal problems, or on those who have beenexposed to cocaine in utero.\nPurpose\nResearch from experiments conducted at the Touch\nResearch Institutes at the University of Miami Schoolof Medicine and Nova Southeastern University hasbeen cited for the clinical benefits massage has oninfants and children. Tiffany Field, Ph. D., director,noted that the research “... suggests that touch is asimportant to infants and children as eating and sleeping.Touch therapy triggers many physiological changes thathelp infants and children grow and develop. For exam-ple, massage can stimulate nerves in the brain whichfacilitate food absorption, resulting in faster weightgain. It also lowers level of stress hormones, resulting\nin improved immune function.”\nThe benefits of infant massage include:\n• relaxation• relief from stress• interaction with adults• stimulation of the nervous system\nThe results of several studies showed that infant mas-\nsage alleviates the stress that newborns experience as aresult of the enormous change that birth brings about in theirlives after the six to nine months they have spent in thewomb. Both premature infants and full-term babies need therelaxation that comes from massaging and moving theirlimbs and muscles. In infants with colic , massage provides\nthe relief necessary to disperse gas, ease muscle spasm, tonethe digestive system and help it work efficiently. Some tech-niques even help bring relief from teething and emotionalstress. The stimulation an infant receives from massage canaid circulation, strengthen muscles, help digestion, andrelieve constipation . The bonding that occurs with massage\nbetween a parent and child enhances the entire process ofbonding that comes with contact through all of the senses,including touch, voice, and sight. It affords a physical expe-rience of quality time between the parents and the child aswell as with any significant others in a baby’s life.\nDescription\nOrigins\nThe practice of massaging infants dates back to\nancient times, particularly in Asian and Pacific Island\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1817Infant massagecultures; that is, massage was a component of the baby’s\nregular bath routine among the Maoris and Hawaiians.Touch in these cultures is considered healthful bothphysically and spiritually. In the West, however, infantmassage has received more attention in recent years inconjunction with the popularity of natural childbirth and\nmidwife-assisted births. Dr. Frédéric Leboyer, a Frenchphysician who was one of the leaders of the naturalchildbirth movement, helped to popularize infant mas-sage through his photojournalistic book on the Indian artof baby massage.\nInfant massage was introduced formally into the\nUnited States in 1978 when Vimala Schneider McClure,a yoga practitioner who served in an orphanage in North-\nern India, developed a training program for instructors atthe request of childbirth educators. An early researchstudy by R. Rice in 1976 had showed that prematurebabies who were massaged surged ahead in weight gainand neurological development over those who were notmassaged. From McClure’s training in India, her knowl-edge of Swedish massage and reflexology , along with\nher knowledge of yoga postures that she had alreadyadapted for babies, she became the foremost authority oninfant massage. In 1986 she founded the InternationalAssociation of Infant Massage (IAIM), which has 27chapters worldwide as of 2000.\nVarious techniques are used in infant massage, with\nthe different strokes specific to a particular therapy. Spe-cial handling is used for treating a baby with gas andcolic. Some of the strokes are known as “Indian milk-ing,” which is a gentle stroking of the child’s legs; andthe “twist and squeeze” stroke, a gentle squeeze of themuscles in the thigh and calf. The light “feather” strokesoften employed in regular Swedish massage are appliedat the end of a massage. The procedure is not unlike cer-tain forms of adult massage, but with extra care taken forthe fragility of the infant.\nThere are also specific Chinese techniques of pedi-\natric massage, including massage of children with spe-cial needs. In China, these forms of massage can begiven by medical professionals, but parents are oftentaught how to do the simpler forms for home treatment oftheir children.\nPreparations\nIf lotions or oils are used, care is taken to ensure\ntheir safety on a baby’s delicate skin. The most impor-tant consideration is to use vegetable oils rather thanmineral oils, which can clog the pores in the skin. Theoil that is used should be warmed in the caregiver’shands before applying it to the baby’s skin. The envi-ronment in which the massage is given to an infantshould be comfortably warm, and as calm and non-\nthreatening as possible.\nPrecautions\nExtreme caution is necessary when performing\ninfant massage. Strokes are made with the greatest deli-cacy in order not to harm the infant in any way. Propertechniques are taught by licensed massage therapistsensuring that the infant is treated with appropriate physi-cal touch. Anyone who is unfamiliar with handling ababy should receive appropriate instruction before begin-ning infant massage.\nSide effects\nNo adverse side effects have been reported when\ninfant massage is done properly after careful instruction,or by a licensed massage therapist who specializes ininfant care.\nResearch and general acceptance\nIn addition to the study already noted regarding\ntouch therapy, a website devoted to infant massage listsresearch published as early as 1969, and cites hundreds ofindividual projects that have been conducted throughoutthe world focusing on infant massage. Many of the stud-ies are related to the benefits of massage and touch forpremature infants and others born with such risk factorsas drug dependence. Conclusions regarding the benefitsare overwhelmingly positive. The proliferation of thera-pists licensed in infant massage across the United Statesand worldwide indicates that infant massage is increas-ingly recognized as a legitimate health care treatment.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAuckett, Amelia.

Women and male homo-sexuals are at greater risk for gonorrheal arthritis than\nare male heterosexuals\n• patients with certain types of cancer\n• IV drug abusers and alcoholics\n• patients with artificial (prosthetic) joints• patients with diabetes, sickle cell anemia, or systemic\nlupus erythematosus (SLE)\n• patients with recent joint injuries or surgery, or patients\nreceiving medications injected directly into a joint\nCauses and symptoms\nIn general, infectious arthritis is caused by the spread\nof a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection through the blood-stream to the joint. The disease agents may enter the jointdirectly from the outside as a result of an injury or a surgi-cal procedure, or they may be carried to the joint by theblood from infections elsewhere in the body. The specificorganisms vary somewhat according to age group. New-borns are most likely to acquire gonococcal infections ofthe joints from a mother with gonorrhea. Children mayalso acquire infectious arthritis from a hospital environ-ment, often as a result of catheter placement. The organ-isms involved are usually either Haemophilus influenzae\n(in children under two years of age) or Staphylococcus\naureus . In older children or adults, the infectious organ-\nisms include Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus\nviridans as well as Staphylococcus aureus . Staphylococ-\ncus epidermidis is usually involved in joint infections\nrelated to surgery. Sexually active teenagers and adultsfrequently develop infectious arthritis from Neisseria\ngonorrhoeae infections. Older adults are often vulnerable\nto joint infections caused by gram-negative bacilli,including Salmonella and Pseudomonas .\nInfectious arthritis often has a sudden onset, but\nsymptoms sometimes develop over a period of three to14 days. The symptoms include swelling in the infectedjoint and pain when the joint is moved. Infectious arthri-tis in the hip may be experienced as pain in the groin areathat becomes much worse if the patient tries to walk. In90% of cases, there is some leakage of tissue fluid intothe affected joint. The joint is sore to the touch; it may ormay not be warm to the touch, depending on how deepthe infection lies within the joint. In most cases thepatient will have fever and chills, although the fever maybe only low-grade. Children sometimes develop nausea\nand vomiting .\nSeptic arthritis is considered a medical emergency\nbecause of the damage it causes to bone as well as carti-lage, and its potential for creating septic shock , which is\na potentially fatal condition. Staphylococcus aureus is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1819Infectious arthritiscapable of destroying cartilage in one or two days.\nDestruction of cartilage and bone in turn leads to disloca-tions of the joints and bones. If the infection is caused bybacteria, it can spread to the blood and surrounding tis-sues, causing abscesses or even blood poisoning . The\nmost common complication of infectious arthritis isosteoarthritis .\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of infectious arthritis depends on a\ncombination of laboratory testing with careful history-taking and physical examination of the affected joint. It\nis important to keep in mind that infectious arthritis cancoexist with other forms of arthritis, gout ,rheumatic\nfever ,Lyme disease , or other disorders that can cause a\ncombination of joint pain and fever. In some cases, thedoctor may consult a specialist in orthopedics or rheuma-tology to avoid misdiagnosis.\nPatient history\nThe patient’s history will tell the doctor whether he\nor she belongs to a high-risk group for infectious arthritis.Sudden onset of joint pain is also important information.\nPhysical examination\nThe doctor will examine the affected joint for swelling,\nsoreness, warmth, and other signs of infection. Location issometimes a clue to diagnosis; infection of an unusual joint,such as the joints between the breastbone and collarbone, orthe pelvic joints, often occurs in drug abusers.KEY TERMS\nArthrocentesis —A procedure in which the doctor\ninserts a needle into the patient’s joint to withdrawfluid for diagnostic testing or to drain infectedfluid from the joint.\nPyogenic arthritis —Another name for infectious\narthritis. Pyogenic means that pus is formed duringthe disease process.\nSepsis —Invasion of the body by disease organisms\nor their toxins. Generalized sepsis can lead toshock and eventual death.\nSeptic arthritis —Another name for infectious\narthritis.\nSynovial fluid (SF) —A fluid secreted by tissues\nsurrounding the joints that lubricates the joints.Laboratory tests\nLaboratory testing is necessary to confirm the diag-\nnosis of infectious arthritis. The doctor will perform anarthrocentesis, which is a procedure that involves with-drawing a sample of synovial fluid (SF) from the jointwith a needle and syringe. SF is a lubricating fluidsecreted by tissues surrounding the joints. Patientsshould be warned that arthrocentesis is a painful proce-dure. The fluid sample is sent for culture in the sealedsyringe. SF from infected joints is usually streaked withpus or looks cloudy and watery. Cell counts usually indi-cate a high level of white cells; a level higher than100,000 cells/mm3 or a neutrophil proportion greaterthan 90% suggests septic arthritis. A Gram’s stain of theculture obtained from the SF is usually positive for thespecific disease organism.\nDoctors sometimes order a biopsy of the synovial\ntissue near the joint if the fluid sample is negative. Cul-tures of other body fluids, such as urine, blood, or cervi-cal mucus, may be taken in addition to the SF culture.\nDiagnostic imaging\nDiagnostic imaging is not helpful in the early stages\nof infectious arthritis. Destruction of bone or cartilagedoes not appear on x rays until 10–14 days after the onsetof symptoms. Imaging studies are sometimes useful ifthe infection is in a deep-seated joint.\nTreatment\nInfectious arthritis requires usually requires several\ndays of treatment in a hospital, with follow-up medicationand physical therapy lasting several weeks or months.\nMedications\nBecause of the possibility of serious damage to the\njoint or other complications if treatment is delayed, thepatient will be started on intravenous antibiotics before\nthe specific organism is identified. After the diseaseorganism has been identified, the doctor may give thepatient a drug that targets the specific bacterium or virus.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are usually\ngiven for viral infections.\nIntravenous antibiotics are given for about two\nweeks, or until the inflammation has disappeared. Thepatient may then be given a two- to four-week course oforal antibiotics.\nSurgery\nIn some cases, surgery is necessary to drain fluid\nfrom the infected joint. Patients who need surgical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1820Infectious arthritisdrainage include those who have not responded to antibi-\notic treatment, those with infections of the hip or otherjoints that are difficult to reach with arthrocentesis, andthose with joint infections related to gunshot or otherpenetrating wounds .\nPatients with severe damage to bone or cartilage\nmay need reconstructive surgery, but it cannot be per-formed until the infection is completely gone.\nMonitoring and supportive treatment\nInfectious arthritis requires careful monitoring while\nthe patient is in the hospital. The doctor will drain the jointon a daily basis and remove a small sample of fluid forculture to check the patient’s response to the antibiotic.\nInfectious arthritis often causes intense pain. Patients\nare given medications to relieve pain, together with hotcompresses or ice packs on the affected joint. In somecases the patient’s arm or leg is put in a splint to protectthe sore joint from accidental movement. Recovery canbe speeded up, however, if the patient practices range-of-motion exercises to the extent that the pain allows.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on prompt treatment with\nantibiotics and drainage of the infected joint. About 70%of patients will recover without permanent joint damage.However, many patients will develop osteoarthritis ordeformed joints. Children with infected hip joints some-times suffer damage to the growth plate. If treatment isdelayed, infectious arthritis has a mortality rate between5% and 30% due to septic shock and respiratory failure .\nPrevention\nSome cases of infectious arthritis are preventable by\nlifestyle choices. These include avoidance of self-inject-ed drugs; sexual abstinence or monogamous relation-ships; and prompt testing and treatment for suspectedcases of gonorrhea. Patients receiving corticosteroidinjections into the joints for osteoarthritis may want toweigh this treatment method against the increased risk ofinfectious arthritis.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Bedside Procedures: Joint Aspiration (Arthrocentesis).” In\nSurgery On Call , ed.

    "content": "Infection control\nDefinition\nInfection control refers to policies and procedures\nused to minimize the risk of spreading infections, espe-cially in hospitals and health care facilities.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of infection control is to reduce the\noccurrence of infectious diseases. These diseases areusually caused by bacteria or viruses and can be spreadby human-to-human contact, animal-to-human contact,human contact with an infected surface, airborne trans-mission through tiny droplets of infectious agents sus-pended in the air, and, finally, by a common vehicle suchas food or water.\nInfection control in hospitals\nInfections obtained in hospitals are also called noso-\ncomial infections. They occur in approximately 5% of allhospital patients. This results in increased time spent inthe hospital and, in some cases, death . There are many\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1821Infection controlreasons nosocomial infections are common, one of\nwhich is that many hospital patients have a weakenedimmune system which makes them more susceptible toinfections. This weakened immune system can be causedeither by the patient’s diseases or by treatments given tothe patient. Second, many medical procedures canincrease the risk of infection by introducing infectiousagents into the patient. Thirdly, many patients are admit-ted to hospitals because of infectious disease. Theseinfectious agents can then be transferred from patient topatient by hospital workers or visitors.\nInfection control has become a formal discipline in\nthe United States since the 1950s, due to the spread ofstaphylococcal infections in hospitals. Because there is\nboth the risk of health care providers acquiring infectionsthemselves, and of their passing infections on to patients,the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention haveestablished guidelines for infection control procedures.In addition to hospitals, infection control is important innursing homes, clinics, child care centers, and restau-rants, as well as in the home.\nThreat of emerging infectious diseases\nDue to constant changes in our lifestyles and envi-\nronments, there are constantly new diseases that peopleare susceptible to, making protection from the threat ofinfectious disease urgent. Many new contagious dis-eases have been identified in the past 30 years, such asAIDS , Ebola, and hantavirus. Increased travel between\ncontinents makes the worldwide spread of disease a big-ger concern than it once was. Additionally, many com-mon infectious diseases have become resistant to knowntreatments.Problems of antibiotic resistance\nBecause of the overuse of antibiotics , many bacteria\nhave developed a resistance to common antibiotics. Thismeans that newer antibiotics must continually be devel-oped in order to treat an infection. However, furtherresistance seems to come about almost simultaneously.This indicates to many scientists that it might becomemore and more difficult to treat infectious diseases. Theuse of antibiotics outside of medicine also contributes toincreased antibiotic resistance. One example of this is theuse of antibiotics in animal husbandry. These negativetrends can only be reversed by establishing a more ratio-nal use of antibiotics through treatment guidelines.\nDescription\nThe goals of infection control programs are: immu-\nnizing against preventable diseases, defining precautionsthat can prevent exposure to infectious agents, andrestricting the exposure of health care workers to aninfectious agent. An infection control practitioner is aspecially trained professional, oftentimes a nurse, whooversees infection control programs.\nCommonly recommended precautions to avoid and\ncontrol the spread of infections include:\n• vaccinate against diseases for which a vaccine is avail-\nable\n• wash hands often\n• cook food thoroughly\n• use antibiotics only as directed\n• see a doctor for infections that do not heal• avoid areas with a lot of insects\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1822Infection controlSelected Infectious Diseases And Corresponding Treatments\nDisease Symptoms Transmittal Treatment\nChicken pox Rash, low-grade fever Person to person None\nCommon cold/ Influenza Runny nose, sore throat, cough, Person to person None\nfever, headache, muscle aches\nHepatitis Jaundice, flu-like symptoms Sexual contact with an infected None\nperson, contaminated blood,food, or water\nLegionnaire’s Disease Flu-like symptoms, pneumonia, Air conditioning or water systems Antibiotics\ndiarrhea, vomiting, kidney failure,respiratory failure\nMeasles Skin rash, runny nose and eyes, Person to person None\nfever, cough\nMeningitis Neck pain, headache, pain caused Person to person Antibiotics for bacterial\nby exposure to light, fever, nausea, meningitis, hospital care for viral meningitisdrowsiness\nMumps Swelling of salivary glands Person to person Anti-inflammatory drugsRingworm Skin rash Contact with infected Antifungal drugs applied topically\nanimal or person\nTetanus Lockjaw, other spasms Soil infection of wounds Antibiotics, antitoxins, muscle relaxers• be cautious around unfamiliar animals\n• do not engage in unprotected sex or in intravenous drug\nuse\n• inquire about infectious diseases when you travel\nBecause of the higher risk of spreading infectious\ndisease in a hospital setting, higher levels of precautionsare taken there. Typically, health care workers weargloves with all patients, since it is difficult to knowwhether a transmittable disease is present or not. Patientswho have a known transmittable infectious disease areisolated to decrease the risk of transmitting the infectiousagent to another person. Hospital workers who come incontact with infected patients must wear gloves andgowns to decrease the risk of carrying the infectious agentto other patients. All articles of equipment that are used inan isolation room are decontaminated before reuse.KEY TERMS\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) —\nA disease that weakens the body’s immune sys-tem.

    "title": "Infectious mononucleosis",
    "content": "Infectious mononucleosis\nDefinition\nInfectious mononucleosis is a contagious illness\ncaused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which can affect theliver, lymph nodes, and oral cavity. While mononucleosisis not usually a serious disease, its primary symptoms offatigue and lack of energy can linger for several months.\nDescription\nInfectious mononucleosis, frequently called “mono”\nor the “kissing disease,” is caused by the Epstein-Barrvirus (EBV) found in saliva and mucus. The virus affectsa type of white blood cell called the B lymphocyte, pro-ducing characteristic atypical lymphocytes that may beuseful in the diagnosis of the disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1823Infectious mononucleosisWhile anyone, even young children, can develop\nmononucleosis, it occurs most often in young adultsbetween the ages of 15 and 35, and is especially commonin teenagers. The mononucleosis infection rate amongcollege students who have not previously been exposedto EBV has been estimated to be about 15%. In youngerchildren, the illness may not be recognized.\nThe disease typically runs its course in four to six\nweeks in people with normally functioning immune sys-tems. People with weakened or suppressed immune sys-tems, such as AIDS patients or those who have had organ\ntransplants, are particularly vulnerable to the potentiallyserious complications of infectious mononucleosis.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe EBV that causes mononucleosis is related to a\ngroup of herpesviruses, including those that cause coldsores, chicken pox, and shingles . Most people are\nexposed to EBV at some point during their lives.Mononucleosis is most commonly spread by contactwith virus-infected saliva through coughing, sneezing,kissing, or sharing drinking glasses or eating utensils.\nIn addition to general weakness and fatigue, symp-\ntoms of mononucleosis may include any or all of the fol-lowing:\n•sore throat and/or swollen tonsils\n• fever and chills\n• nausea and vomiting, or decreased appetite• swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits\n• headaches or joint pain\n• enlarged spleen\n• jaundice\n• skin rash\nComplications that can occur with mononucleosis\ninclude a temporarily enlarged spleen or inflamed liver.In rare instances, the spleen may rupture, producingsharp pain on the left side of the abdomen, a symptomthat warrants immediate medical attention. Additionalsymptoms of a ruptured spleen include lightheadedness,rapidly beating heart, and difficulty breathing. Otherrare, but potentially life-threatening, complications mayinvolve the heart or brain. The infection may also causesignificant destruction of the body’s red blood cells orplatelets.\nSymptoms do not usually appear until four to seven\nweeks after exposure to EBV . An infected person can becontagious during this incubation time period and for asmany as five months after the disappearance of symp-toms. Also, the virus will be excreted in the saliva inter-mittently for the rest of their lives, although the individ-\nual will experience no symptoms. Contrary to popularbelief, the EBV is not highly contagious. As a result,individuals living in a household or college dormitorywith someone who has mononucleosis have a very smallrisk of being infected unless they have direct contact withthe person’s saliva.\nDiagnosis\nIf symptoms associated with a cold persist longer\nthan two weeks, mononucleosis is a possibility; however,a variety of other conditions can produce similar symp-toms. If mononucleosis is suspected, a physician willtypically conduct a physical examination , including a\n“Monospot” antibody blood test that can indicate thepresence of proteins or antibodies produced in responseto infection with the EBV. These antibodies may not bedetectable, however, until the second or third weeks ofthe illness. Occasionally, when this test is inconclusive,other blood tests may be conducted.\nTreatment\nThe most effective treatment for infectious mononu-\ncleosis is rest and a gradual return to regular activities.Individuals with mild cases may not require bed rest butshould limit their activities. Any strenuous activity, ath-letic endeavors, or heavy lifting should be avoided untilthe symptoms completely subside, since excessive activi-ty may cause the spleen to rupture.\nThe sore throat and dehydration that usually\naccompany mononucleosis may be relieved by drinkingwater and fruit juices. Gargling salt water or takingthroat lozenges may also relieve discomfort. In addition,taking over-the-counter medications, such as aceta-\nminophen or ibuprofen, may relieve symptoms, but\naspirin should be avoided because mononucleosis has\nbeen associated with Reye’s syndrome , a serious illness\naggravated by aspirin.\nWhile antibiotics do not affect EBV , the sore throat\naccompanying mononucleosis can be complicated by astreptococcal infection, which can be treated with antibi-otics. Cortisone anti-inflammatory medications are alsooccasionally prescribed for the treatment of severelyswollen tonsils or throat tissues.\nPrognosis\nWhile the severity and length of illness varies, most\npeople diagnosed with mononucleosis will be able toreturn to their normal daily routines within two to threeweeks, particularly if they rest during this time period. Itmay take two to three months before a person’s usual\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1824Infectious mononucleosisenergy levels return. One of the most common problems\nin treating mononucleosis, particularly in teenagers, isthat people return to their usual activities too quicklyand then experience a relapse of symptoms. Once thedisease has completely run its course, the person cannotbe reinfected.\nPrevention\nAlthough there is no way to avoid becoming infect-\ned with EBV , paying general attention to good hygieneand avoiding sharing beverage glasses or having closecontact with people who have mononucleosis or coldsymptoms can help prevent infection.\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Merck Manual. 16th ed.

Insecondary infertility, one or both members of the couplehave previously conceived, but are unable to conceiveagain after a full year of trying.\nDescription\nCurrently, in the United States, about 20% of cou-\nples struggle with infertility at any given time. Infertilityhas increased as a problem over the last 30 years. Somestudies pin the blame for this increase on social phenom-ena, including the tendency for marriage to occur at alater age, which means that couples are trying to startfamilies at a later age. It is well known that fertility inwomen decreases with increasing age, as illustrated bythe following statistics:\n• infertility in married women ages 16–20 = 4.5%\n• infertility in married women ages 35–40 = 31.8%\n• infertility in married women over the age of 40 = 70%.\nNowadays, individuals often have multiple sexual\npartners before they marry and try to have children. Thisincrease in numbers of sexual partners has led to anincrease in sexually transmitted diseases . Scarring\nfrom these infections, especially from pelvic inflamma-\ntory disease (a serious infection of the female reproduc-\ntive organs, most commonly caused by gonorrhea )\nseems to be in part responsible for the increase in infertil-ity noted. Furthermore, the use of some forms of the con-traceptive called the intrauterine device ( IUD ) con-\ntributed to an increased rate of pelvic inflammatory dis-ease, with subsequent scarring. However, newer IUDs donot lead to this increased rate of infection.\nTo understand issues of infertility, it is first neces-\nsary to understand the basics of human reproduction.Fertilization occurs when a sperm from the male mergeswith an egg (ovum) from the female, creating a zygotethat contains genetic material (DNA) from both thefather and the mother. If pregnancy is then established,the zygote will develop into an embryo, then a fetus, andultimately a baby will be born.\nThe male contribution to fertilization and the estab-\nlishment of pregnancy is the sperm. Sperm are smallcells that carry the father’s genetic material. This geneticmaterial is contained within the oval head of the sperm.The sperm are mixed into a fluid called semen, which isdischarged from the penis during sexual intercourse. The\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1825Infertilitywhip-like tail of the sperm allows the sperm to swim up\nthe female reproductive tract, in search of the egg it willtry to fertilize.\nThe female makes many contributions to fertiliza-\ntion and the establishment of pregnancy. The ovum is thecell that carries the mother’s genetic material. These ovadevelop within the ovaries. Once a month, a singlemature ovum is produced, and leaves the ovary in aprocess called ovulation. This ovum enters a tube leadingto the uterus (the fallopian tube). The ovum needs tomeet up with the sperm in the fallopian tube if fertiliza-tion is to occur.\nWhen fertilization occurs, the resulting cell (which\nnow contains genetic material from both the mother andthe father) is called the zygote. This single cell willdivide into many other cells within the fallopian tube,and the resulting cluster of cells (called a blastocyst) willthen move into the womb (uterus). The uterine lining(endometrium) has been preparing itself to receive apregnancy by growing thicker. If the blastocyst success-fully reaches the inside of the uterus and attaches itself tothe wall of the uterus, then implantation and pregnancyhave been achieved.\nCauses and symptoms\nUnlike most medical problems, infertility is an issue\nrequiring the careful evaluation of two separate individu-als, as well as an evaluation of their interactions witheach other. In about 3–4% of couples, no cause for theirinfertility will be discovered. About 40% of the time, theroot of the couple’s infertility is due to a problem withthe male partner; about 40% of the time, the root of theinfertility is due to the female partner; and about 20% ofthe time, there are fertility problems with both the man\nand the woman.\nThe main factors involved in causing infertility, list-\ning from the most to the least common, include:\n• male problems: 35%• ovulation problems: 20%• tubal problems: 20%\n•endometriosis : 10%\n• cervical factors: 5%\nMale factors\nMale infertility can be caused by a number of differ-\nent characteristics of the sperm. To check for these char-acteristics, a sample of semen is obtained and examinedunder the microscope ( semen analysis ). Four basic char-\nacteristics are usually evaluated:\n• Sperm count refers to the number of sperm present in a\nsemen sample. The normal number of sperm present injust one milliliter (ml) of semen is over 20 million. Anindividual with only 5–20 million sperm per ml ofsemen is considered subfertile; an individual with lessthan 5 million sperm per ml of semen is consideredinfertile.\n• Sperm are also examined to see how well they swim\n(sperm motility) and to be sure that most have normalstructure.\n• Not all sperm within a specimen of semen will be per-\nfectly normal. Some may be immature, and some mayhave abnormalities of the head or tail. A normal semensample will contain no more than 25% abnormal formsof sperm.\n• V olume of the semen sample is important. An abnormal\namount of semen could affect the ability of the sperm tosuccessfully fertilize an ovum.\nAnother test can be performed to evaluate the ability\nof the sperm to penetrate the outer coat of the ovum. Thisis done by observing whether sperm in a semen samplecan penetrate the outer coat of a guinea pig ovum; fertil-ization cannot occur, of course, but this test is useful inpredicting the ability of the individual’s sperm to pene-trate a human ovum.\nAny number of conditions result in abnormal find-\nings in the semen analysis. Men can be born with testi-cles that have not descended properly from the abdomi-nal cavity (where testicles develop originally) into thescrotal sac, or may be born with only one instead of thenormal two testicles. Testicle size can be smaller thannormal. Past infection (including mumps ) can affect tes-\nticular function, as can a past injury. The presence of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1826Infertility\nA microscopic image of a needle (left) injecting sperm cells\ndirectly into a human egg (center).The broad object at rightis a pipette used to hold the ovum steady. (Phototake NYC.\nReproduced by permission.)abnormally large veins (varicocele) in the testicles can\nincrease testicular temperature, which decreases spermcount. History of having been exposed to various toxins,drug use, excess alcohol use, use of anabolic steroids,certain medications, diabetes, thyroid problems, or otherendocrine disturbances can have direct effects on the for-mation of sperm (spermatogenesis). Problems with themale anatomy can cause sperm to be ejaculated not outof the penis, but into the bladder; and scarring from pastinfections can interfere with ejaculation.\nTreatment of male infertility includes addressing\nknown reversible factors first; for example, discontinuingany medication known to have an effect on spermatogen-esis or ejaculation, as well as decreasing alcohol intake,and treating thyroid or other endocrine disease. Varicoce-les can be treated surgically. Testosterone in low dosescan improve sperm motility.\nOther treatments of male infertility include collect-\ning semen samples from multiple ejaculations, afterwhich the semen is put through a process that allows the\nmost motile sperm to be sorted out. These motile spermare pooled together to create a concentrate that candeposited into the female partner’s uterus at a time thatcoincides with ovulation. In cases in which the malepartner’s sperm is proven to be absolutely unable tocause pregnancy in the female partner, and with the con-sent of both partners, donor sperm may be used for thisprocess. Depositing the male partner’s sperm or donorsperm by mechanical means into the female partner areboth forms of artificial insemination.\nOvulatory problems\nThe first step in diagnosing ovulatory problems is to\nmake sure that an ovum is being produced each month. Awoman’s morning body temperature is slightly higheraround the time of ovulation. A woman can measure andrecord her temperatures daily, and a chart can be drawnto show whether or not ovulation has occurred. Luteiniz-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1827Infertility\nInjection of\nsperm and eggs\nFallopian\ntube\nOvary\nCytoplasm of eggInjection of\nspermBA\nA. An egg and sperm are injected into the fallopian tube to encourage natural fertilization in a procedure called gamete\nintrafallopian transfer (GIFT). B. An alternative to GIFT is the injection of sperm directly into an egg using microscopic nee-dles. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)ing hormone (LH) is released just before ovulation. A\nsimple urine test can be done to check if LH has beenreleased around the time that ovulation is expected.\nTreatment of ovulatory problems depends on the\ncause. If a thyroid or pituitary problem is responsible,simply treating that problem can restore fertility. (Thethyroid and pituitary glands release hormones that alsoare involved in regulating a woman’s menstrual cycle.)Medication can also be used to stimulate fertility. Themost commonly used of these are called Clomid andPergonal. These drugs increase the risk of multiple births(twins, triplets, etc.).\nPelvic adhesions and endometriosis\nPelvic adhesions and endometriosis can cause infer-\ntility by preventing the sperm from reaching the egg orinterfering with fertilization.\nPelvic adhesions are fibrous scars. These scars can\nbe the result of past infections, such as pelvic inflamma-tory disease, or infections following abortions or priorbirths. Previous surgeries can also leave behind scarring.\nEndometriosis may lead to pelvic adhesions.\nEndometriosis is the abnormal location of uterine tissueoutside of the uterus. When uterine tissue is planted else-where in the pelvis, it still bleeds on a monthly basis withthe start of the normal menstrual period. This leads toKEY TERMS\nBlastocyst —A cluster of cells representing multiple\ncell divisions that have occurred in the fallopiantube after successful fertilization of an ovum by asperm. This is the developmental form which mustleave the fallopian tube, enter the uterus, andimplant itself in the uterus to achieve actual preg-nancy.\nCervix —The opening from the vagina, which leads\ninto the uterus.\nEmbryo —The stage of development of a baby\nbetween the second and eighth weeks after concep-tion.\nEndometrium —The lining of the uterus.\nFallopian tube —The tube leading from the ovary\ninto the uterus. Just as there are two ovaries, thereare two fallopian tubes.\nFetus —A baby developing in the uterus from the\nthird month to birth.Ovary —The female organ in which eggs (ova) are\nstored and mature.\nOvum (plural: ova) —The reproductive cell of the\nfemale, which contains genetic information andparticipates in the act of fertilization. Also popularlycalled the egg.\nSemen —The fluid that contains sperm, which is\nejaculated by the male.\nSperm —The reproductive cell of the male, which\ncontains genetic information and participates in theact of fertilization of an ovum.\nSpermatogenesis —The process by which sperm\ndevelop to become mature sperm, capable of fertil-izing an ovum.\nZygote —The result of the sperm successfully fertil-\nizing the ovum. The zygote is a single cell that con-tains the genetic material of both the mother andthe father.\nirritation within the pelvis around the site of this abnor-\nmal tissue and bleeding, and may cause scarring.\nPelvic adhesions cause infertility by blocking the\nfallopian tubes. The ovum may be prevented from travel-ing down the fallopian tube from the ovary or the spermmay be prevented from traveling up the fallopian tubefrom the uterus.\nA hysterosalpingogram (HSG) can show if the fallopi-\nan tubes are blocked. This is an x-ray exam that testswhether dye material can travel through the patient’s fal-lopian tubes. A few women become pregnant followingthis x-ray exam. It is thought that the dye material in someway helps flush out the tubes, decreasing any existingobstruction. Scarring also can be diagnosed by examiningthe pelvic area through the use of a scope that can be insert-ed into the abdomen through a tiny incision made near thenaval. This scoping technique is called laparoscopy .\nPelvic adhesions can be treated during laparoscopy.\nThe adhesions are cut using special instruments.Endometriosis can be treated with certain medications,but may also require surgery to repair any obstructioncaused by adhesions.\nCervical factors\nThe cervix is the opening from the vagina into the\nuterus through which the sperm must pass. Mucus pro-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1828Infertilityduced by the cervix helps to transport the sperm into the\nuterus. Injury to the cervix or scarring of the cervix aftersurgery or infection can result in a smaller than normalcervical opening, making it difficult for the sperm toenter. Injury or infection can also decrease the number ofglands in the cervix, leading to a smaller amount of cer-vical mucus. In other situations, the mucus produced isthe wrong consistency (perhaps too thick) to allow spermto travel through. In addition, some women produce anti-bodies (immune cells) that are specifically directed toidentify sperm as foreign invaders and to kill them.\nCervical mucus can be examined under a micro-\nscope to diagnose whether cervical factors are contribut-ing to infertility. The interaction of a live sperm samplefrom the male partner and a sample of cervical mucusfrom the female partner can also be examined. This pro-cedure is called a postcoital test.\nTreatment of cervical factors includes antibiotics in\nthe case of an infection, steroids to decrease productionof anti-sperm antibodies, and artificial insemination tech-niques to completely bypass the cervical mucus.\nTreatment\nAssisted reproductive techniques include in vitro\nfertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer\n(GIFT), and zygote intrafallopian tube transfer (ZIFT).These are usually used after other techniques to treatinfertility have failed.\nIn vitro fertilization involves the use of a drug to induce\nthe simultaneous release of many eggs from the female’sovaries, which are retrieved surgically. Meanwhile, severalsemen samples are obtained from the male partner, and asperm concentrate is prepared. The ova and sperm are thencombined in a laboratory, where several of the ova may befertilized. Cell division is allowed to take place up to theembryo stage. While this takes place, the female may begiven drugs to ensure that her uterus is ready to receive anembryo. Three or four of the embryos are transferred to thefemale’s uterus, and the wait begins to see if any or all ofthem implant and result in an actual pregnancy.\nSuccess rates of IVF are still rather low. Most cen-\nters report pregnancy rates between 10–20%. Since mostIVF procedures put more than one embryo into theuterus, the chance for a multiple birth (twins or more) isgreatly increased in couples undergoing IVF.\nGIFT involves retrieval of both multiple ova and\nsemen, and the mechanical placement of both within thefemale partner’s fallopian tubes, where one hopes thatfertilization will occur. ZIFT involves the same retrievalof ova and semen, and fertilization and growth in the lab-oratory up to the zygote stage, at which point the zygotesare placed in the fallopian tubes. Both GIFT and ZIFT\nseem to have higher success rates than IVF.\nPrognosis\nIt is very hard to obtain statistics regarding the prog-\nnosis of infertility because many different problems mayexist within an individual or couple trying to conceive. Ingeneral, it is believed that of all couples who undergo acomplete evaluation of infertility followed by treatment,about half will ultimately have a successful pregnancy.Of those couples who do not choose to undergo evalua-tion or treatment, about 5% will go on to conceive after ayear or more of infertility.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHornstein, Mark D., and Daniel Schust. “Infertility.” In\nNovak’s Gynecology. 12th ed.

For pregnancy to occur,the woman’s reproductive system must release eggs reg-ularly—a process called ovulation. The man must pro-duce healthy sperm that are able to reach and unite withan egg. And once an egg is fertilized, it must travel to thewoman’s uterus (womb), become implanted and remainthere to be nourished.\nIf a couple is infertile because the woman is not ovu-\nlating, infertility drugs may be prescribed to stimulateovulation. The first step usually is to try a drug such asclomiphene. If that doesn’t work, human chorionicgonadotropin (HCG) may be tried, usually in combina-tion with other infertility drugs.\nClomiphene and HCG may also be used to treat\nother conditions in both males and females.\nDescription\nClomiphene (Clomid, Serophene) comes in tablet\nform and is available only with a physician’s prescrip-tion. Human chorionic gonadotropin is given as an injec-tion, only under a physician’s supervision.\nClomiphene citrate is used to increase the natural\nproduction of the hormones that stimulate ovulation inotherwise healthy women. When clomiphene is adminis-tered, the body produces higher levels of luteinizing hor-mone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), andgonadotropins. These hormones induce ovulation.\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is sold\nunder man brand names including Gonic, Pregnyl andProfasi. This hormone stimulates the gonads in bothmen and women.

Human chorionic gonadotropin can help stimu-\nlate ovulation in women.\nAlthough some people believe that HCG can help\nlose weight, there is no evidence that this hormone offersany benefit in weight loss programs. It should not beused for this purpose.\nA number of other natural and synthetic hormones\nare used to induce ovulation.

The physician may recommend using an ovu-lation prediction test kit to help determine the best timesfor intercourse.\nSome people feel dizzy or lightheaded, or less alert\nwhen using clomiphene. The medicine may also causeblurred vision and other vision changes. Anyone whotakes clomiphene should not drive, use machines or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.\nQuestions remain about the safety of long-term\ntreatment with clomiphene. Women should not havemore than 6 courses of treatment with this drug andshould ask their physicians for the most up-to-date infor-mation about its use.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1830Infertility drugsSpecial conditions\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or\nwho are taking certain other medicines may have prob-lems if they take infertility drugs.

    "title": "Infertility therapies",
    "content": "Infertility therapies\nDefinition\nInfertility is the inability of a man and a woman to\nconceive a child through sexual intercourse. There aremany possible reasons for the problem, which caninvolve the man, the woman, or both partners. Varioustreatments are available that enable a woman to becomepregnant; the correct one will depend on the specificcause of the infertility.\nPurpose\nInfertility treatment is aimed at enabling a woman to\nhave a baby by treating the man, the woman, or bothpartners. During normal conception of a child, the man’ssperm will travel to the woman’s fallopian tubes, where,if conditions are right, it will encounter an egg that hasbeen released from the ovary. The sperm will fertilize theegg, which will enter the uterus where it implants andbegins to divide, forming what’s called an embryo. Theembryo will develop during pregnancy into a baby.\nInfertility treatment attempts to correct or compen-\nsate for any abnormalities in this process that prevent thefertilization of an egg or development of an embryo.\nPrecautions\nIt’s important for a couple contemplating infertility\ntreatment to examine their own ideas and feelings aboutthe process and consider ethical objections before thewoman becomes pregnant from such treatment.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1831Infertility therapiesDescription\nAbout 90% of women who are trying to get pregnant\nand use no birth control will do so within one year. Ifafter one year of having frequent sexual intercourse withno contraception a couple has not conceived, they\nshould seek the advice of a physician. Tests can be per-formed to look for possible infertility problems.\nTreating an underlying infection or illness is the first\nstep in infertility treatment. The physician may also sug-gest improving general health, dietary changes, reducingstress , and counseling.\nTreatments\nLow sperm count treatments\nThe most common cause of male infertility is failure\nto produce enough healthy sperm. For fertilization tohappen, the number of sperm cells in the man’s semen(the fluid ejected during sexual intercourse) must be suf-ficient, and the sperm cells must have the right shape,appearance, and activity (motility).\nDefects in the sperm can be caused by an infection\nresulting from a sexually transmitted disease, a blockagecaused by a varicose vein in the scrotum (varicocele), anendocrine imbalance, or problems with other male repro-ductive organs (such as the testicles, prostate gland, orseminal vesicles).\nIf a low sperm count is the problem, it’s possible to\nrestore fertility by:\n• treating underlying infections• timing sex to coincide with the time the woman is ovu-\nlating, which means that the egg is released from theovary and is beginning to travel down the fallopian tube(the site of fertilization)\n• having sex less often to build up the number of sperm in\nthe semen\n• treating any endocrine imbalance with drugs• having a surgical procedure to remove a varicocele\n(varicocelectomy)\nFertility drugs\nIf infertility is due to a woman’s failure to release\neggs from the ovary (ovulate), fertility drugs can helpbring hormone levels into balance, stimulating theovaries and triggering egg production.\nSurgical repair\nIn some women, infertility is due to blocked fallopi-\nan tubes. The egg is released from the ovary, but thesperm is prevented from reaching it because of a physicalobstruction in the fallopian tube. If this is the case,\nsurgery may help repair the damage. Microsurgery cansometimes repair the damage to scarred fallopian tubes ifit is not too severe. Not all tube damage can be repaired,however, and most tubal problems are more successfullytreated with in vitro fertilization .\nFibroid tumors in the uterus also may cause infertili-\nty, and they can be surgically treated. Endometriosis ,a\ncondition in which parts of the lining of the uterusbecome imbedded in other internal organs (such as theovaries or fallopian tubes) may contribute to infertility. Itmay be necessary to surgically remove the endometrialtissue to improve fertility.\nArtificial insemination\nArtificial insemination may be tried if sperm count is\nlow, the man is impotent, or the woman’s vagina creates ahostile environment for the sperm. The procedure is notalways successful. In this procedure, the semen is collect-ed and placed into the woman’s cervix with a smallsyringe at the time of ovulation. From the cervix, it cantravel to the fallopian tube where fertilization takes place.If the partner’s sperm count is low, it can be mixed withdonor sperm before being transferred into the uterus.\nIf there is no sperm in the male partner’s semen, then\nartificial insemination can be performed using a donor’ssperm obtained from a sperm bank.\nAssisted reproductive technologies\nSome fertility treatments require removal of the eggs\nand/or sperm and manipulation of them in certain waysin a laboratory to assist fertilization. These techniquesare called assisted reproductive technologies.\nIN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF). When infertility\ncan’t be treated by other means or when the cause is notknown, it’s still possible to become pregnant through invitro fertilization (IVF), a costly, complex procedure thatachieves pregnancy 20% of the time.\nIn this procedure, a woman’s eggs are removed by\nwithdrawing them with a special needle. Attempts arethen made to fertilize the eggs with sperm from her part-ner or a donor. This fertilization takes place in a petridish in a laboratory. The fertilized egg (embryo) is thenreturned to the woman’s uterus.\nOften, three to six fertilized eggs are returned at the\nsame time into the uterus. Usually one or two of theembryos survive and grow into fetuses, but sometimesthree or more fetuses result.\nA child born in this method is popularly known as a\n“test tube baby,” but in fact the child actually developsinside the mother. Only the fertilization of the egg takesplace in the laboratory.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1832Infertility therapiesINTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION (ICSI). In a\nvariation of IVF called intracytoplasmic sperm injection(ICSI), single sperm cells are injected directly into eachegg. This may be helpful for men with severe infertility.\nGAMETE INTERFALLOPIAN TRANSFER (GIFT). In this\ntechnique, sperm and eggs are placed directly into thewoman’s fallopian tubes to encourage fertilization tooccur naturally. This procedure is done with the help oflaparoscopy . In laparoscopy, a small tube with a viewing\nlens at one end is inserted into the abdomen through asmall incision. The lens allows the physician to seeinside the patient on a video monitor.\nZYGOTE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER (ZIFT). If infer-\ntility is caused by a low sperm count, zygote intrafallopi-an transfer (ZIFT) can be tried. This technique combinesGIFT and IVF. This procedure is also called a “tubalembryo transfer.”\nIn this technique, in vitro fertilization is first per-\nformed, so that the actual fertilization takes place and isconfirmed in the laboratory. Two days later, instead ofplacing the embryo in the uterus, the physician performslaparoscopy to place the embryos in the fallopian tube,much like the GIFT procedure.\nA woman must have at least one functioning fallopi-\nan tube in order to participate in ZIFT.\nPreparation\nCouples who are having fertility problems may want\nto limit or avoid:\n• tobacco\n• alcohol• caffeine\n• stress\n• tight-fitting undershorts (men)\n• hot tubs, saunas and steam rooms (high temperatures\ncan kill sperm)\nRisks\nWomen who take fertility drugs have a higher likeli-\nhood of getting pregnant with more than one child at once.There are also rare but serious side effects to fertility drugs.\nNormal results\nTypically, at least half of all couples who are infer-\ntile will respond to treatment with a successful pregnan-cy. For those who cannot become pregnant with treat-ment or insemination, surrogate parenting or adoptingmay be a workable option.KEY TERMS\nGamete —An egg (ovum) from the female or a\nmature sperm from the male.\nLaparoscopy —A procedure in which a viewing\ntube is inserted through the abdominal wall toexamine a woman’s reproductive organs.\nOvulation —The release of an egg from the ovary.\nFertilization can occur within a day or two of ovu-lation.\nZygote —A fertilized egg.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerger, Gary S., et al.

    "title": "Influenza",
    "content": "Influenza\nDefinition\nUsually referred to as the flu or grippe, influenza is a\nhighly infectious respiratory disease. The disease iscaused by certain strains of the influenza virus. When thevirus is inhaled, it attacks cells in the upper respiratorytract, causing such typical flu symptoms as fatigue ,\nfever and chills, a hacking cough , and body aches.\nInfluenza victims are also susceptible to potentially life-threatening secondary infections. Although the stomachor intestinal “flu” is commonly blamed for stomachupsets and diarrhea , the influenza virus rarely causes\ngastrointestinal symptoms. Such symptoms are most\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1833Influenzalikely due to other organisms such as rotavirus, Salmo-\nnella ,Shigella , or Escherichia coli .\nDescription\nThe flu is considerably more debilitating than the\ncommon cold . Influenza outbreaks occur suddenly, and\ninfection spreads rapidly. The annual death toll attribut-\nable to influenza and its complications averages 20,000in the United States alone. In the 1918–1919 Spanish flupandemic, the death toll reached a staggering 20–40 mil-lion worldwide. Approximately 500,000 of these fatali-ties occurred in America.\nInfluenza outbreaks occur on a regular basis. The\nmost serious outbreaks are pandemics, which affect mil-lions of people worldwide and last for several months.The 1918-1919 influenza outbreak serves as the primaryexample of an influenza pandemic. Pandemics alsooccurred in 1957 and 1968 with the Asian flu and HongKong flu, respectively. The Asian flu was responsible for70,000 deaths in the United States, while the Hong Kongflu killed 34,000.\nEpidemics are widespread regional outbreaks that\noccur every two to three years and affect 5–10% of thepopulation. The Russian flu in the winter of 1977 is anexample of an epidemic. A regional epidemic is shorterlived than a pandemic, lasting only several weeks. Final-ly, there are smaller outbreaks each winter that are con-fined to specific locales.\nThe earliest existing descriptions of influenza were\nwritten nearly 2,500 years ago by the ancient Greekphysician Hippocrates. Historically, influenza wasascribed to a number of different agents, including “badair” and several different bacteria. It was not until 1933that the causative agent was identified as a virus.\nThere are three types of influenza viruses, identified\nas A, B, and C. Influenza A can infect a range of species,including humans, pigs, horses, and birds, but onlyhumans are infected by types B and C. Influenza A isresponsible for most flu cases, while infection with typesB and C virus are less common and cause a milder illness.\nCauses and symptoms\nApproximately one to four days after infection with\nthe influenza virus, the victim is hit with an array ofsymptoms. “Hit” is an appropriate term, because symp-toms are sudden, harsh, and unmistakable. Typicalinfluenza symptoms include the abrupt onset of aheadache , dry cough, and chills, rapidly followed by\noverall achiness and a fever that may run as high as 104°F(40°C). As the fever subsides, nasal congestion and a sore\nthroat become noticeable. Flu victims feel extremelytired and weak and may not return to their normal energy\nlevels for several days or even a couple of weeks.\nInfluenza complications usually arise from bacterial\ninfections of the lower respiratory tract. Signs of a sec-ondary respiratory infection often appear just as the vic-tim seems to be recovering. These signs include highfever, intense chills, chest pains associated with breath-ing, and a productive cough with thick yellowish greensputum. If these symptoms appear, medical treatment isnecessary. Other secondary infections, such as sinus orear infections, may also require medical intervention.Heart and lung problems, and other chronic diseases, canbe aggravated by influenza, which is a particular concernwith elderly patients.\nWith children and teenagers, it is advisable to be\nalert for symptoms of Reye’s syndrome , a rare but seri-\nous complication. Symptoms of Reye’s syndrome arenausea and vomiting , and more seriously, such neuro-\nlogical problems as confusion or delirium . The syn-\ndrome has been associated with the use of aspirin to\nrelieve flu symptoms.\nDiagnosis\nAlthough there are specific tests to identify the flu\nvirus strain from respiratory samples, doctors typicallyrely on a set of symptoms and the presence of influenza inthe community for diagnosis. Specific tests are useful todetermine the type of flu in the community, but they do lit-tle for individual treatment. Doctors may administer tests,such as throat cultures, to identify secondary infections.\nTreatment\nEssentially, a bout of influenza must be allowed to\nrun its course. Symptoms can be relieved with bed restand by keeping well hydrated. A steam vaporizer maymake breathing easier, and pain relievers will take care\nof the aches and pain. Food may not seem very appetiz-ing, but an effort should be made to consume nourishingfood. Recovery should not be pushed too rapidly. Return-ing to normal activities too quickly invites a possiblerelapse or complications.\nDrugs\nSince influenza is a viral infection, antibiotics are\nuseless in treating it. However, antibiotics are frequentlyused to treat secondary infections.\nOver-the-counter medications are used to treat flu\nsymptoms, but it is not necessary to purchase a medicationmarketed specifically for flu symptoms. Any medicationthat is designed to relieve symptoms, such as pain and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1834Influenzacoughing, will provide some relief. Medications containing\nalcohol, however, should be avoided because of the dehy-drating effects of alcohol. The best medicine for symptomsis simply an analgesic, such as aspirin, acetaminophen ,o r\nnaproxen. Without a doctor’s approval, aspirin is generallynot recommended for people under 18 owing to its associa-tion with Reye’s syndrome, a rare aspirin-associated com-plication seen in children recovering from the flu. To be onthe safe side, children should receive acetaminophen oribuprofen to treat their symptoms.\nThere are two antiviral drugs marketed for use in\nthe United States. These may be useful in treating indi-viduals who have weakened immune systems or who areat risk for developing serious complications of influenzabut may be allergic to the flu vaccine. The first is amanta-dine hydrochloride, which is marketed under the namesSymmetrel (syrup), Symadine (capsule) and Amanta-dine-hydrochloride (capsule and syrup). The secondantiviral is rimantadine hydrochloride, trade nameFlumandine (tablet and syrup). These two drugs arechemically related and are effective only against type Ainfluenza viruses. Both drugs can cause such side effectsas nervousness, anxiety , lightheadedness, and nausea,\nwith side effects more likely to occur with amantadine.Severe side effects include seizures, delirium, and hallu-cination, but are rare and are nearly always limited topeople who have kidney problems, seizure disorders, orpsychiatric disorders.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are several alternative treatments that may\nhelp in fighting off the virus and recovering from the flu,in addition to easing flu symptoms.\n•Acupuncture and acupressure . Both are said to stimu-\nlate natural resistance, relieve nasal congestion andheadaches, fight fever, and calm coughs, depending onthe acupuncture and acupressure points used.\n• Aromatherapy. Aromatherapists recommend gargling\ndaily with one drop each of the essential oils of tea tree(Melaleuca spp.) and lemon mixed in a glass of warm\nwater. If already suffering from the flu, two drops of teatree oil in a hot bath may help ease the symptoms.Essential oils of eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus globulus ) or\npeppermint ( Mentha piperita ) added to a steam vapor-\nizer may help clear chest and nasal congestion.\n• Herbal remedies. Herbal remedies can be used stimu-\nlate the immune system ( echinacea ), as antivirals\n(Hydrastis canadensis ) goldenseal and garlic ( Allium\nsativum ), or directed at whatever symptoms arise as a\nresult of the flu. For example, an infusion of boneset(Eupatroium perfoliatum ) may counteract aches andfever, and yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ) or elderflower\ntinctures may combat chills.\n• Homeopathy. To prevent flu, a homeopathic remedy\ncalled Oscillococcinum may be taken at the first sign of\nflu symptoms and repeated for a day or two. Other home-opathic remedies recommended vary according to thespecific flu symptoms present. Gelsemium (Gelsemium\nsempervirens ) is recommended to combat weakness\naccompanied by chills, a headache, and nasal congestion.Bryonia (Bryonia alba ) may be used to treat muscle\naches, headaches, and a dry cough. For restlessness,chills, hoarseness, and achy joints, poison ivy ( Rhus toxi-\ncodendron ) is recommended. Finally, for achiness and a\ndry cough or chills, Eupatorium perfoliatum is suggested.\n• Hydrotherapy. A bath to induce a fever will speed\nrecovery from the flu by creating an environment in thebody in which the flu virus cannot survive. The patientshould take a bath as hot as he/she can tolerate andremain in the bath for 20–30 minutes. While in thebath, the patient drinks a cup of yarrow or elderflowertea to induce sweating. During the bath, a cold cloth isheld on the forehead or at the nape of the neck to keepthe temperature down in the brain. The patient is assist-ed when getting out of the bath (he/she may feel weakor dizzy) and then gets into bed and covers up with lay-ers of blankets to induce more sweating.\n• Vitamins. For adults, 2–3 grams of vitamin C daily may\nhelp prevent the flu. Increasing the dose to 5–7 gramsper day during the flu can help fight the infection. (Thedose should be reduced if diarrhea develops.)\nPrognosis\nFollowing proper treatment guidelines, healthy peo-\nple under the age of 65 usually suffer no long-term con-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1835Influenza\nA transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of influen-\nza viruses budding from the surface of an infected cell.(Photo Researchers, Inc.

The elderly and\nthe chronically ill are at greater risk for secondary infec-tion and other complications, but they can also enjoy acomplete recovery.\nMost people recover fully from an influenza infec-\ntion, but it should not be viewed complacently. Influenzais a serious disease, and approximately 1 in 1,000 casesproves fatal.\nPrevention\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rec-\nommend that people get an influenza vaccine injectioneach year before flu season starts. In the United States,flu season typically runs from late December to earlyMarch. Vaccines should be received two to six weeksprior to the onset of flu season to allow the body enoughtime to establish immunity. Adults need only one dose ofthe yearly vaccine, but children under nine years of agewho have not previously been immunized should receivetwo doses, with a month between each dose.\nEach season’s flu vaccine contains three virus strains\nthat are the most likely to be encountered in the coming fluseason. When there is a good match between the anticipat-ed flu strains and the strains used in the vaccine, the vac-cine is 70–90% effective in people under 65. Becauseimmune response diminishes somewhat with age, peopleover 65 may not receive the same level of protection fromthe vaccine, but even if they do contract the flu, the vaccinediminishes the severity and helps prevent complications.\nThe virus strains used to make the vaccine are inacti-\nvated and will not cause the flu. In the past, flu symp-toms were associated with vaccine preparations that wereKEY TERMS\nCommon cold —A mild illness caused by upper\nrespiratory viruses. Usual symptoms include nasalcongestion, coughing, sneezing, throat irritation,and a low-grade fever.\nEpidemic —A widespread regional disease out-\nbreak.\nGuillain-Barré syndrome —Also called acute idio-\npathic polyneuritis, this condition is a neurologicsyndrome that can cause numbness in the limbsand muscle weakness following certain viral infec-tions.\nPandemic —Worldwide outbreak of an infection,\nafflicting millions of victims.not as highly purified as modern vaccines, not to the\nvirus itself. In 1976, there was a slightly increased risk ofdeveloping Guillain-Barré syndrome , a very rare disor-\nder, associated with the swine flu vaccine. This associa-tion occurred only with the 1976 swine flu vaccinepreparation and has never recurred.\nSerious side effects with modern vaccines are\nextremely unusual. Some people experience a slight sore-ness at the point of injection, which resolves within a dayor two. People who have never been exposed to influenza,particularly children, may experience one to two days of aslight fever, tiredness, and muscle aches. These symptomsstart within six to 12 hours after the vaccination .\nIt should be noted that certain people should not\nreceive influenza vaccine. Infants six months andyounger have immature immune systems and will notbenefit from the vaccine. Since the vaccines are preparedusing hen eggs, people who have severe allergies to eggs\nor other vaccine components should not receive theinfluenza vaccine. As an alternative, they may receive acourse of amantadine or rimantadine, which are alsoused as a protective measure against influenza. Otherpeople who might receive these drugs are those that havebeen immunized after the flu season has started or whoare immunocompromised, such as people with advancedHIV disease. Amantadine and rimantadine are 70-90%effective in preventing influenza.\nCertain groups are strongly advised to be vaccinated\nbecause they are at risk for influenza-related complica-tions:\n• all people 65 years and older\n• residents of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities,\nregardless of age\n• adults and children who have chronic heart or lung\nproblems, such as asthma\n• adults and children who have such chronic metabolic\ndiseases as diabetes and renal dysfunction, as well assevere anemia or inherited hemoglobin disorders\n• children and teenagers who are on long-term aspirin\ntherapy\n• women who will be in their second or third trimester of\npregnancy during flu season or women who are nursing\n• anyone who is immunocompromised, including HIV-\ninfected persons; cancer patients; organ transplant\nrecipients; and patients receiving steroids, chemother-\napy, or radiation therapy\n• anyone in contact with the above groups, such as teach-\ners, care givers, health care personnel, and family mem-bers\n• travelers to foreign countries\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1836InfluenzaAn individual need not be in one of the at-risk cate-\ngories listed above, however, to receive a flu vaccination.Anyone who wants to forego the discomfort and incon-venience of an influenza attack may receive the vaccine.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLevine, Arthur J. “The Influenza A Virus.” In Viruses.

    "title": "Inhalation therapies",
    "content": "Inhalation therapies\nDefinition\nInhalation therapies are a group of respiratory, or\nbreathing, treatments designed to help restore or improvebreathing function in patients with a variety of diseases,conditions, or injuries. The treatments range from at-home oxygen therapy for patients with chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease to mechanical ventilation forpatients with acute respiratory failure . Inhalation thera-\npies usually include the following categories:\n• oxygen therapy• incentive spirometry\n• continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n• oxygen chamber therapy\n• mechanical ventilation\n• newborn life supportPurpose\nInhalation therapies are ordered for various stages of\ndiseases that are causing progressive or sudden respirato-ry failure. Although physicians generally follow guide-lines to assign specific therapy according the type andstage of a disease, the ultimate decision is based on anumber of tests indicating pulmonary function and thepresence or absence of oxygen in body organs and tissues.\nOxygen therapy\nOxygen therapy is most commonly ordered to sup-\nport patients with emphysema and other chronic\nobstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). The oxygentherapy is usually ordered once decreased oxygen satura-tion in the blood or tissues is demonstrated. Oxygen ther-apy may also be used in the hospital setting to help returna patient’s breathing and oxygen levels to normal.\nIncentive spirometry\nSpirometry is a diagnostic method for measuring\ngases and respiratory function. Incentive spirometry maybe ordered to help patients practice and improve con-trolled breathing. It may be ordered after surgery to theabdomen, lungs, neck, or head.\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\nCommon uses of continuous positive airway pres-\nsure include sleep apnea ,respiratory distress syn-\ndrome in infants, and adult respiratory distress syn-\ndrome . Signs of atelectasis (absence of gas from the\nlungs) or abnormalities of the lower airways may alsoindicate CPAP.\nOxygen chamber therapy\nOxygen chamber therapy is ordered for various\ncauses that indicate immediate need for oxygen satura-tion in the blood. Divers with decompression illness,climbers at high altitude, patients suffering from severecarbon dioxide poisoning , and children or adults in acute\nrespiratory distress may require oxygen chamber therapy.In recent years, physicians have also used the forcedpressure of oxygen chambers to help heal burns and\nother wounds , since the pressure under which the oxy-\ngen is delivered can reach areas that are blocked off orsuffering from poor circulation.\nMechanical ventilation\nMechanical ventilation is ordered for patients in\nacute respiratory distress, and is often used in an inten-sive care situation. In some cases, mechanical ventilationis a final attempt to continue the breathing function in apatient and may be considered “life-sustaining.”\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1837Inhalation therapiesNewborn life support\nNewborn babies, particularly those who were pre-\nmature, may require inhalation therapies immediatelyupon birth, since the lungs are among the last organs tofully develop. Some newborns suffer from serious respi-ratory problems or birth complications, such as respirato-ry distress syndrome, neonatal wet lung syndrome, apneaof prematurity or persistent fetal circulation, which may\nrequire inhalation therapies.\nPrecautions\nThere are numerous indications for not prescribing\nvarious inhalation therapies.\nOxygen therapy\nPatients and family members who smoke should not\nhave oxygen prescribed or should avoid smoking in the\narea to prevent combustion. Sedatives should be avoidedfor patients on oxygen therapy.\nIncentive spirometry\nPatients who are unable or unwilling to properly and\nconsistently practice incentive spirometry as prescribedshould not receive this form of treatment.\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\nPatients unable or unwilling to comply with the\nphysician’s instructions for use of CPAP are not likely tohave it prescribed. Extremely obese patients may haveless success with this form of therapy for the treatment ofsleep apnea.\nOxygen chamber therapy\nComplications may arise from this form of treatment\nand during transport to or from the oxygen chamber.Therefore, some patients may not receive enough benefitto outweigh possible complications. All patients, particu-larly children, must be carefully monitored.\nMechanical ventilation\nUse of mechanical ventilation will be carefully\nweighed against benefit and possible risks. Some patientswill require sedation to prevent fighting off the ventila-\ntor, which can increase the risk of complications.\nNewborn life support\nNot all infants with breathing problems will require\nmeasures as severe as mechanical ventilation. The physi-cian will make the determination based on weight andcondition of the infant. Newborns with patent ductus\narteriosis, a handicap affecting the pulmonary artery, aremore likely to suffer pulmonary hemorrhage frommechanical ventilation.\nDescription\nOxygen therapy\nOnce a patient shows hypoxemia, or decreased oxy-\ngen in arterial blood, supplemental oxygen may beordered. The main purpose of the oxygen is to preventdamage to vital organs resulting from inadequate oxygensupply. The lowest possible saturation will be given tokeep the patient’s measurements at a minimum accept-able level. The oxygen is administered through a mask ornasal tube, or sometimes directly into the trachea. Theamount of oxygen prescribed is measured in liters offlow per minute. Patients with chronic hypoxemia, mostlikely in late stages of COPD, will often receive long-term oxygen therapy.\nMost patients will receive their long-term oxygen\ntherapy through home oxygen use. A physician must pre-scribe home oxygen and levels will be monitored toensure that the correct amount of oxygen is administered.Some patients will receive oxygen therapy only at nightor when exercising.\nThe choice of type of home oxygen systems will\nvary depending on availability, cost considerations, andthe mobility of the patient. Those patients who are ambu-latory, especially those who work, will need a systemwith a small portable tank. Depending on the systemchosen, frequent deliveries of oxygen and filling ofportable tanks will be necessary.\nIn the case of respiratory distress in newborns or\nadults, oxygen therapy may be attempted before mechan-ical ventilation since it is a noninvasive and less expen-sive choice. Oxygen has been found effective in treatingpatients with such other diseases as cystic fibrosis ,\nchronic congestive heart failure , or other lung diseases.\nIncentive spirometry\nIncentive spirometry is also referred to as sustained\nmaximal inspiration. It is designed to mimic natural sighsand yawns. A device provides positive feedback when apatient inhales at a predetermined rate and sustains thebreath for a specific period of time. This helps teach thepatient to take long, slow, and deep breaths. A spirometer,or equipment that measures pulmonary function, is provid-ed to the patient and a respiratory therapist will work withthe patient; to demonstrate and explain the technique. Oncepatients show mastery of the technique, they are instructedto practice the exercises frequently on their own.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1838Inhalation therapiesContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\nPatients with sleep apnea will receive continuous\npositive airway pressure to prevent upper airway col-lapse. It is usually administered through a tight-fittingmask as humidified oxygen. The pressure of flow is con-stant during both exhaling and inhaling and the level ofpressure is determined based on each individual. Mostpatients undergoing CPAP in a hospital setting willreceive continuous monitoring of some vital signs andperiodic sampling of blood gas values.\nOxygen chamber therapy\nAlso known as hyperbaric oxygen chamber or hyper-\nbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), this treatment delivers pureoxygen under pressure equal to that of two to three timesnormal atmospheric pressure. For years, this treatment hasbeen especially effective on scuba divers who suffer fromthe “bends,” or decompression illness. The patient entersthe chamber, a plastic cylinder-shaped structure that isnormally transparent. In most cases, just one patient willenter by being rolled into the chamber on a type of stretch-er. Once inside, the oxygen will be delivered under forcedpressure and the patient is free to read, nap, or listen to theradio. The therapy usually lasts one hour, although it cantake up to five hours in serious decompression cases.Before exiting the chamber, the pressure will eventually belowered to normal atmospheric level.\nMechanical ventilation\nIn general, mechanical ventilation replaces or sup-\nports the normal ventilatory lung function of a patient.Although normally delivered in a hospital, often to treatserious illness, mechanical ventilation may be performedat home under the order and supervision of a physicianand home health agency. The patient will usually be intu-bated and the ventilator machine “takes over” the breath-ing function.\nThere are several modes and methods of mechanical\nventilation, each offering different advantages and disad-vantages. In assist/control ventilation, the oldest mode ofventilation, the physician predetermines settings and theventilator delivers a breath each time the patient makes aneffort to inhale. In synchronized intermittent mandatoryventilation, the machine senses a patient’s effort to inhaleand delivers the preset amount. The amount cannot beincreased by the patient’s effort. Pressure-control ventila-tion involves the physician’s selection of a peak pressure;this method is most useful for patients suffering fromobstructive airways disease. In cases of severe hypoventi-lation, an endotracheal tube must be inserted. If a patientwill be on mechanical ventilation for more than twoweeks, a tracheostomy, or surgical incision, will be per-formed for placement of the breathing tubes.There are other modes of ventilation that may be used,\nincluding high-frequency ventilation, a newer techniquethat delivers 100 to 200 breaths per minute to the patient.The breaths are delivered through a humidified, high-pres-sure gas jet. High-frequency ventilation may be orderedwhen a patient does not respond to conventional mechani-cal ventilation or for certain conditions and circumstances.\nNewborn life support\nPremature infants, especially those born before the\n28th week of gestation, have underdeveloped breathingmuscles and immature structures within the lungs. Theseinfants will require breathing support, often in the form ofmechanical ventilation. The support delivers warm,humidified, oxygen-enriched gases either by oxygen hoodor through mechanical ventilation. In serious cases, theinfant may require mechanical ventilation with CPAP orpositive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) through a tightlyfitting face mask or even by endotracheal intubation.\nNeed for continued resuscitation for newborns\ndepends not only on gestational age, but on signs indicat-ing ineffective breathing—including color, heart rate, andrespiratory effort. CPAP will be delivered through nasalor endotracheal tubes with a continuous-flow ventilatorspecifically designed for infants. An alarm system alertsthe neonatal staff to problems and monitoring of breath-ing and other vital functions will accompany the therapy.As respiratory distress syndrome begins to resolve, usual-ly in four or five days, the type of support will be reducedaccordingly and the infant may be weaned from the venti-lator and moved to only CPAP or an oxygen hood.\nPreparation\nPreparation for any of these treatments is normally\nnot necessary; and in fact, these therapies may be admin-istered as a result of an emergency situation. Some of themethods, particularly incentive spirometry, or at-homeoxygen or ventilation, will require education and cooper-ation with a home health agency or respiratory therapist.Pretreatment testing of various indicators of respiratoryfunction and oxygen saturation will be performed todetermine exact needs of individual patients.\nAftercare\nPulmonary function tests and other tests will be per-\nformed to verify that treatments have been successful orto monitor and adjust treatments. Mechanical ventilationwill require weaning from the equipment and may alsorequire care for the area surrounding the intubation.\nRisks\nInhalation therapies may carry risks, complications\nor side effects including:\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1839Inhalation therapiesOxygen therapy\nAt-home oxygen therapy carries risk if care is not\ntaken to follow instructions when handling the oxygen.Patients are cautioned not to smoke near the oxygen sup-ply and to keep the supply away from other sources thatmay cause electrical spark, flames, or intense heat.Patients on home oxygen therapy should avoid use ofsedatives.\nIncentive spirometry\nThe major risk associated with incentive spirometry\nrelates to improper use. Patients must be carefullyinstructed in the technique and monitored periodicallyfor compliance and improvement. Barotrauma, injury tothe middle ear or sinuses caused by imbalance betweenthe affected cavity and the outside, or ambient pressure,can result from incentive spirometry. A patient may alsosuffer discomfort or fatigue .\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\nThe effectiveness of CPAP may be limited if patients\ndo not cooperate. Possible side effects of CPAP includeskin abrasions from the mask, leakage from the tube ormask, nasal congestion, nasal or oral dryness, or discom-fort from the pressure of delivery.KEY TERMS\nAspiration —Accidental suction of fluids or vomit\ninto the respiratory system.\nCannula —A tube inserted into a cavity to serve as\na channel for the transport of fluid.\nEndotracheal —Placed within the trachea.\nHypoventilation —Reduced ventilation in the\nlungs’ air sacs resulting in above normal carbondioxide pressure.\nHypoxemia —A condition in which there is defi-\ncient oxygen supply in the blood.\nHypoxia —Low levels of oxygen in blood, tissue,\nor air.\nIntubation —Placement of a tube into a hollow\norgan (such as the trachea).\nPneumothorax —Presence of gas or air in the hol-\nlow space around the lungs.\nTrachea —The windpipe, or main by which air\npasses to and from the lungs.Oxygen chamber therapy\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy is painless. The only risk\nwould be associated with improper administration of thepressure levels, which should not occur, since respiratorystaff and the supervising physician should be thoroughlytrained in performance of this therapy. The drawback tohyperbaric oxygen treatment is the limited availability ofchambers. Many cities do not have readily availablechambers.\nMechanical ventilation\nThe biggest risk of mechanical ventilation is some-\ntimes considered to be a patient’s dependence on themachine and the difficulty of weaning the patient. Thephysician will carefully select and monitor the mode ofventilation, the machine’s settings, and the patient’sprogress to prevent this complication. A patient maytherefore be left on a ventilator after sufficient progress ismade to gradually wean breathing dependence.\nIntubation and mechanical ventilation are frighten-\ning and uncomfortable for many patients and they mayfight the ventilator. If this occurs, the physician mayorder a sedative to ensure cooperation and effectivenessof the therapy. Intubation often results in irritation to thetrachea and larynx. Tracheostomy is associated with riskof bleeding, pneumothorax , local infection, and\nincreased incidence of aspiration.\nNewborn life support\nInfants are continuously monitored to determine\neven small changes in breathing function. Mechanicalventilation can result in increases in respiratory distressor other complications. It is possible for the ventilator tobe accidentally disconnected and staff is trained to watchfor signs or alarms indicating disconnection. Mechanicalventilation increases risk of infection in prematurebabies. Complications of PEEP or CPAP may includepneumothorax or decreased cardiac output.\nNormal results\nOxygen therapy\nIn the case of COPD, oxygen therapy does not treat\nthe disease but can prolong life, quality of life, and onsetof more serious symptoms. Effective oxygen therapy forany patient should lead to improved or sustained levels ofoxygen in arterial blood.\nIncentive spirometry\nWith proper use of incentive spirometry, the physi-\ncian should observe improved pulse rate, decreased res-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1840Inhalation therapiespiratory rate, improved respiratory muscle performance,\nand other indicators of improved function. Lung functionfollowing lung resection should show marked improve-ment following incentive spirometry.\nContinuous positive airway pressure\nSuccessful CPAP will result in reduction in apnea\nfor those suffering from sleep apnea. A study completedin 1998 demonstrated that CPAP was effective in themajority of patients with sleep apnea, with the exceptionof significantly obese patients with blood gas values thatwere worse during waking hours at rest and at exercise .\nHospitalized patients on CPAP therapy should showimprovement in blood gas and other pulmonary measure-ments as expected by the treating physician.\nOxygen chamber therapy\nDivers undergoing emergency treatment in a hyper-\nbaric chamber should show immediate improvement inoxygen levels throughout the body, regardless of bloodflow restrictions, after one or two treatments. Thosepatients receiving oxygen chamber therapy for difficultwounds may continue to receive treatments daily for sev-eral weeks before satisfactory results are reached.Patients with carbon dioxide poisoning should showimprovement in or recovery of neurologic function.Results of hyperbaric chamber therapy depend largely onhow quickly the patient was brought to the chamber, aswell as the severity of the initial condition.\nMechanical ventilation\nSuccessful mechanical ventilation will result in\ngradual decrease in dependence on the ventilator andweaning from the machine. Reduction of therapy toanother form, such as CPAP or oxygen therapy, indicatesthat ventilation has worked as expected. In the case ofCOPD, exacerbation may be successfully treated withmechanical ventilation and the patient may return tohome oxygen therapy. Pediatric patients will demonstratenormal growth and development as a normal result oflong-term mechanical ventilation at home. Somepatients, particularly those in a hospital intensive careunit, will not be able to breathe again without the ventila-tor; and families and physicians will face tough choicesabout continued life support.\nNewborn life support\nNeonates will be constantly monitored to measure\nlung function. Those measurements will help caregiversdetermine if and when mechanical ventilation can bereduced and CPAP or oxygen mask begun. CPAP is con-sidered successful when the infant’s respiratory rate isreduced by 30–40%, a chest radiograph shows improved\nlung volume and appearance, stabilization of oxygen lev-els is documented and caregivers observe improvementin the infant’s comfort. Evidence that there is no infec-tion from ventilation is also considered normal. In somecases, inhalation therapy, including mechanical ventila-tion, will not work and the infant’s parents and physi-cians will face tough decisions about invasive procedureswith associated high risks or cessation of life support.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Association for Respiratory Care. 11030 Ables Lane,\nDallas, TX 75229.

Theiruse is popular since they are effective and do not remainin the environment, disintegrating within a few days.Organophosphates act to inhibit an enzyme in humanscalled acetyl cholinesterase. This enzyme functions todegrade a chemical called acetylcholine, which excitesnerve cells. The resultant effect of organophosphateswould be an increase in acetylcholine, thus causing ini-tial excitation of nerve cells.\nPoisoning can occur with a broad range of symp-\ntoms affecting the functioning of nerves and initialsymptoms similar to the flu, such as vomiting, abdominalpain ,dizziness , and headache .

A specialtype of insecticide called paraquat is very lethal andresponsible for approximately 1,000 deaths per year justin Japan. Paraquat poisoning releases oxygen free radi-cals that destroy lung and kidney tissues. When poison-ing is suspected, a comprehensive management andassessment plan should be performed. This initial assess-ment should include:\n• description of toxins: names of chemical(s)\n• magnitude of exposure: determination of amount of\nexposure\n• progression of symptoms: determining the progression\nof symptoms can provide information concerning life\nsupport and overall outcome\n• time of exposure: knowing the time of exposure is vital\nsince symptoms may be delayed, and it may assist todevelop a management plan\n• medical history: underlying diseases and therapeutic\nmediations may worsen toxic manifestations\nCauses and symptoms\nExposure to insecticides can occur by ingestion,\ninhalation, or exposure to skin or eyes. The chemicals areabsorbed through the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinaltract and then widely distributed in tissues. Symptomscover a broad spectrum and affect several organ systems:\n• gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, cramps, excess sali-\nvation, and loss of bowel control\n• lungs: increases in bronchial mucous secretions, cough-\ning,wheezing , difficulty breathing, and water collec-\ntion in the lungs (this can progress to breathing cessa-tion)\n• skin: sweating\n• eyes: blurred vision, smaller sized pupil, and increased\ntearing\n• heart: slowed heart rate, block of the electrical conduc-\ntion responsible for heartbeat, and lowered blood pres-sure\n• urinary system: urinary frequency and lack of control\n• central nervous system: convulsions, confusion, paral-\nysis, and coma\nDiagnosis\nThe confirmatory diagnosis for insecticide poison-\ning is a measurement of blood acetyl cholinesterase lessthan 50% of normal. The chemicals can also be detectedby specific urine testing. Signs and symptoms in additionto a comprehensive poisoning assessment are essential\nfor diagnosis. Carbamate insecticide poisoning exhibitssymptoms similar to organophosphate poisoning butwithout central nervous system signs.\nTreatment\nDecontaminate exposed clothing and wash with soap\nand water immediately. Emergency measures may focuson ventilator support and heart monitoring. If inhalation issuspected, the patient should be removed from the site ofexposure. If the eyes were the entry site, they should beflushed with large amounts of water. If the chemicalswere ingested, the stomach may be washed out and acti-vated charcoal may be administered. Atropine or glycopy-rrolate (Robinul) is the drug of choice for carbamateinsecticide poisoning. It reverses many symptoms, but isonly partially effective for such central nervous symptomeffects as coma and convulsions.

    "title": "Insomnia",
    "content": "Insomnia\nDefinition\nInsomnia is the inability to obtain an adequate\namount or quality of sleep. The difficulty can be infalling asleep, remaining asleep, or both. People withinsomnia do not feel refreshed when they wake up.Insomnia is a common symptom affecting millions ofpeople that may be caused by many conditions, diseases,or circumstances.\nDescription\nSleep is essential for mental and physical restora-\ntion. It is a cycle with two separate states: rapid eyemovement (REM), the stage in which most dreamingoccurs; and non-REM (NREM). Four stages of sleep takeplace during NREM: stage I, when the person passesfrom relaxed wakefulness; stage II, an early stage of lightsleep; stages III and IV , which are increasing degrees ofdeep sleep. Most stage IV sleep (also called delta sleep),occurs in the first several hours of sleep. A period ofREM sleep normally follows a period of NREM sleep.\nInsomnia is more common in women and older\nadults. People who are divorced, widowed, or separatedare more likely to have the problem than those who aremarried, and it is more frequently reported by those oflower socioeconomic status. Short-term, or transient,insomnia is a common occurrence and usually lasts only afew days. Long-term, or chronic, insomnia lasts more thanthree weeks and increases the risk for injuries in the home,at the workplace, and while driving because of daytimesleepiness and decreased concentration. Chronic insomniacan also lead to mood disorders like depression.\nCauses and symptoms\nTransient insomnia is often caused by a temporary sit-\nuation in a person’s life, such as an argument with a lovedone, a brief medical illness, or jet lag . When the situation\nis resolved or the precipitating factor disappears, the con-dition goes away, usually without medical treatment.\nChronic insomnia usually has different causes, and\nthere may be more than one. These include:\n• a medical condition or its treatment, including sleep\napnea\n• use of substances such as caffeine , alcohol, and nico-\ntine\n• psychiatric conditions such as mood or anxiety disor-\nders\n•stress , such as sadness caused by the loss of a loved\none or a job\n• disturbed sleep cycles caused by a change in work shift\n• sleep-disordered breathing, such as snoring\n• periodic jerky leg movements ( nocturnal myoclonus ),\nwhich happen just as the individual is falling asleep\n• repeated nightmares or panic attacks during sleep\nAnother cause is excessive worrying about whether\nor not a person will be able to go to sleep, which createsso much anxiety that the individual’s bedtime rituals and\nbehavior actually trigger insomnia. The more one wor-ries about falling asleep, the harder it becomes. This iscalled psychophysiological insomnia.\nSymptoms of insomnia\nPeople who have insomnia do not start the day\nrefreshed from a good night’s sleep. They are tired. Theymay have difficulty falling asleep, and commonly lie inbed tossing and turning for hours. Or the individual maygo to sleep without a problem but wakes in the earlyhours of the morning and is either unable to go back tosleep, or drifts into a restless unsatisfying sleep. This is acommon symptom in the elderly and in those sufferingfrom depression. Sometimes sleep patterns are reversed,and the individual has difficulty staying awake during theday and takes frequent naps. The sleep at night is fitfuland frequently interrupted.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1843InsomniaDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of insomnia is made by a physician\nbased on the patient’s reported signs and symptoms. Itcan be useful for the patient to keep a daily record fortwo weeks of sleep patterns, food intake, use of alcohol,medications, exercise , and any other information recom-\nmended by the physician. If the patient has a bed partner,information can be obtained about whether the patientsnores or is restless during sleep. This, together with amedical history and physical examination , can help\nconfirm the doctor’s assessment.\nA wide variety of health care professionals can rec-\nognize and treat insomnia, but when a patient withchronic insomnia does not respond to treatment, or thecondition is not adequately explained by the patient’sphysical, emotional, or mental circumstances, then moreextensive testing by a specialist in sleep disorders may\nbe warranted.\nTreatment\nTreatment of insomnia includes alleviating any\nphysical and emotional problems that are contributing tothe condition, and exploring changes in lifestyle that willimprove the situation.KEY TERMS\nBiofeedback —A training technique that enables\nan individual to gain some element of control overinvoluntary body functions.\nMood disorder —A group of mental disorders\ninvolving a disturbance of mood, along with eithera full or partial excessively happy (manic) orextremely sad (depressive) syndrome not causedby any other physical or mental disorder. Moodrefers to a prolonged emotion.\nSleep apnea —A condition in which a person stops\nbreathing while asleep. These periods can last upto a minute or more, and can occur many timeseach hour. In order to start breathing again, theperson must become semi-awake. The episodesare not remembered, but the following day theclient feels tired and sleepy. If severe, sleep apneacan cause other medical problems.\nSleep disorder —Any condition that interferes with\nsleep. At least 84 have been identified, accordingto the American Sleep Disorders Association.Changes in behavior\nPatients can make changes in their daily routine that\nare simple and effective in treating their insomnia. Theyshould go to bed only when sleepy and use the bedroomonly for sleep. Other activities like reading, watchingtelevision, or snacking should take place somewhereelse. If they are unable to go to sleep, they should go intoanother room and do something that is relaxing, likereading. Watching television should be avoided becauseit has an arousing effect. The person should return to bedonly when they feel sleepy. Patients should set the alarmand get up every morning at the same time, no matterhow much they have slept, to establish a regular sleep-wake pattern. Naps during the day should be avoided, butif absolutely necessary, then a 30-minute nap early in theafternoon may not interfere with sleep at night.\nAnother successful technique is called sleep-restric-\ntion therapy, which restricts the amount of time spent inbed to the actual time spent sleeping. This approachallows a slight sleep debt to build up, which increases theindividual’s ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. If apatient is sleeping five hours a night, the time in bed islimited to 5-5 1/2 hours. The time in bed is graduallyincreased in small segments,with the individual rising atthe same time each morning; at least 85% of the time inbed must be spent sleeping.\nDrug therapy\nMedications given for insomnia include sedatives,\ntranquilizers, and antianxiety drugs . All require a doc-\ntor’s prescription and may become habit-forming. Theycan lose effectiveness over time and can reduce alertnessduring the day. The medications should be taken two tofour times daily for approximately three to four weeks,though this will vary with the physician and patient. Ifthe insomnia is related to depression, then an antidepres-sant medication may be helpful. Over-the-counter drugssuch as antihistamines are not very effective in bringing\nabout sleep, and can affect the quality of sleep.\nOther measures\nRelaxing before going to bed will help a person fall\nasleep faster. Learning to substitute pleasant thoughts forunpleasant ones (imagery training) is a technique thatcan be very helpful in reducing worry. Another effectivemeasure is the use of audiotapes that combine the soundsof nature with soft relaxing music. These, alone or incombination with other relaxation techniques, can safelypromote sleepiness.\nChanges in diet and exercise routines can also have a benefi-\ncial effect. Dietary items to be avoided include drinks that contain\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1844Insomniacaffeine, such as coffee, tea and colas’ chocolate (which contains\na stimulant); and alcohol, which initially makes a person sleepybut a few hours later can have the opposite effect. Maintaining acomfortable bedroom temperature, reducing noise and eliminat-ing light are also helpful. Regularly scheduled morning or after-noon exercise can relax the body. This should be done 3-4 times aweek and be sufficient to produce a light sweat.\nAlternative treatments\nMany alternative treatments are effective in treating both\nthe symptom of insomnia and its underlying causes. Incorpo-rating relaxation techniques into bedtime rituals will help aperson go to sleep faster, as well as improve the quality ofsleep. These methods include meditation ; massage; breath-\ning exercises; and a warm bath, scented with rose, lavender(Lavendula officinalis ), marjoram, or chamomile ( Matricaria\nrecutita ). Eating a healthy diet rich in calcium, magnesium,\nand the B vitamins is also beneficial. A high-protein snack\nlike yogurt before going to bed is recommended, or a cup ofherb tea made with chamomile, hops ( Humulus lupulus ), pas-\nsionflower ( Passiflora incarnata ), or St. John’s-Wort ( Hyper-\nicum perforatum ) to encourage relaxation. Acupuncture and\nbiofeedback have also proven useful.\nPrevention\nPrevention of insomnia centers around promotion of a\nhealthy lifestyle. A balance of rest, recreation and exercise incombination with stress management, regular physical exam-inations, and a healthy diet can do much to reduce the risk.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBoyd, Mary Ann, and Mary Ann Nihart.

    "title": "Intermittent explosive disorder",
    "content": "Intermittent explosive disorder\nDefinition\nIntermittent explosive disorder (IED) is a mental dis-\nturbance that is characterized by specific episodes of vio-lent and aggressive behavior that may involve harm to oth-ers or destruction of property. Usually, these episodes fol-low minor incidents and are out of proportion to the trigger.\nDescription\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-\nders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) decribes intermittent explosivedisorder as one of several impulse-control disorders, includ-ing kleptomania (impulsive stealing), pathological gambling,and pyromania (setting fires). There must be several instancesof failure to resist aggressive or violent behaviors that result inharm to others or destruction of property. Spurred by a minorincident, these acts are grossly out of proportion to the stres-sor. To meet the criteria for IED, these behaviors are notcaused by another mental disorder (e.g. antisocial personalitydisorder, bipolar disorder , borderline personality disorder,\nor attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ). These impul-\nsive acts are not caused by substance abuse or medical condi-tion (head trauma or Alzheimer’s disease .\nMany psychiatrists do not place intermittent explo-\nsive disorder into a separate clinical category but consid-er it a symptom of other psychiatric and mental disor-ders. Future acts of violence may escalate, despite how itis defined, and treatment is essential.\nIED occurs more often in men. Women do experi-\nence it and have reported it as part of premenstrual syn-\ndrome (PMS).\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nAs with other impulse-control disorders, the cause\nof IED has not been determined.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1845Intermittent explosive disorderSymptoms\nIED causes such violent behavior as physical assault,\ndestruction of property, and homicide or violent suicide.Violent, destructive behaviors often begin in childhoodand escalate in adult life.\nDiagnosis\nA thorough case history of behavior and medical prob-\nlems is taken. A diagnosis is made by a psychiatrist or psy-chologist after interviews and psychological testing. SinceIED is a behavioral illness, no medical tests have been ableas yet to find an organic cause. Treatment options with cer-tain drugs may point to a relationship with bipolar disorderand serotonin (a brain chemical) conditions.\nTreatment\nTreatment for IED usually involves psychotherapy of\nsome type, drugs, or biofeedback . Usually, a regime of\ntherapy (behavior modification, among others) and drugs ismost common. Good success has occurred with mood stabi-lizers and antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants. Amongthese drugs are Prozac, Zoloft, Neurontin, and Dilantin.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for IED is good with proper diagnosis,\nmedications, and therapy. Still, more research is neededto determine the mechanisms involved in this disorder.\nPrevention\nThere is no know way to prevent this disorder and\nno clinical way to diagnose it until behaviors appear.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nMcElroy, Susan L. “Recognition and Treatment of DSM-IV\nIntermittent Explosive Disorder.” Journal of Clinical Psy-\nchiatry (1999): 12-16.KEY TERMS\nKleptomania —A mental disorder characterized by\nimpulsive stealing.\nPyromania —A mental disorder characterized by\nsetting fires.\nSerotonin —A neurotransmitter or brain chemical\nthat is responsible for transporting nerve impulses.OTHER\n“DSM-IV Axis I Diagnosis.” Psychiatrist.com.

    "content": "Intersex states\nDefinition\nIntersex states are conditions in which a newborn’s sex\norgans (genitals) look unusual, making it impossible toidentify the sex of the baby from their outward appearance.\nDescription\nAll developing babies start out with external sex\norgans that look female. If the baby is male, the internalsex organs mature and begin to produce the male hormonetestosterone. If the hormones reach the tissues correctly,the external genitals change into the scrotum and penis.Sometimes, the genetic sex (as indicated by chromo-somes) may not match the appearance of the external sexorgans. About one in every 2,000 births results in a babywhose sex organs are ambiguous.\nPatients with intersex states can be classified as a\ntrue hermaphrodite, a female pseudohermaphrodite, or amale pseudohermaphrodite. This is determined by exam-ining the internal and external structures of the child.\nA true hermaphrodite is born with both ovaries and\ntesticles. They also have mixed male and female externalgenitals. This condition is extremely rare.\nA female pseudohermaphrodite is a genetic female.\nHowever, the external sex organs have been masculinizedand look like a penis. This may occur if the mother takes thehormone progesterone to prevent a miscarriage , but more\noften it is caused by an overproduction of certain hormones.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1846Intersex statesA male pseudohermaphrodite is a genetic male.\nHowever, the external sex organs fail to develop normal-ly. Intersex males may have testes and a female-likevulva, or a very small penis.\nCauses and symptoms\nAny abnormality in chromosomes or sex hormones,\nor in the unborn baby’s response to the hormones, canlead to an intersex state in a newborn.\nIntersex states may also be caused by a condition\ncalled congenital adrenal hyperplasia , which occurs in\nabout one out of every 5,000 newborns. This diseaseblocks the baby’s metabolism and can cause a range ofsymptoms, including abnormal genitals.\nDiagnosis\nWhen doctors are uncertain about a newborn’s sex, a\nspecialist in infant hormonal problems is consulted assoon as possible. Ultrasound can locate a uterus behindthe bladder and can determine if there is a cervix or uter-ine canal. Blood tests can check the levels of sex hor-mones in the baby’s blood, and chromosome analysis(called karyotyping) can determine sex. Exploratorysurgery or a biopsy of reproductive tissue may be neces-sary. Only after thorough testing can a correct diagnosisand determination of sex be made.\nTreatment\nTreatment of intersex states is controversial. Tradi-\ntional treatment assigns sex according to test results; thepotential for the child to identify with a sex; and the easeof genital surgery to make the organs look more normal.Treatment may then include reconstructive surgery fol-KEY TERMS\nChromosomes —Spaghetti-like structures located\nwithin the nucleus (or central portion) of each cell.Chromosomes contain the genetic informationnecessary to direct the development and function-ing of all cells and systems in the body.

Babies born with congenital\nadrenal hyperplasia can be treated with cortisone-typedrugs and sometimes surgery.\nCounseling should be given to the entire family of an\nintersex newborn. Families should explore all availablemedical and surgical options. Counseling should also beprovided to the child when he or she is old enough.\nPrognosis\nSince the mid-1950s, doctors have typically assigned\na sex to an intersex infant based on how easy reconstruc-tive surgery would be. The American Academy of Pedi-atrics states that children with these types of genitals canbe raised successfully as members of either sex, and rec-ommends surgery within the first 15 months of life.\nSome people are critical of this approach, including\nintersex adults who were operated on as children.

    "title": "Intestinal obstructions",
    "content": "Intestinal obstructions\nDefinition\nIntestinal obstruction is the partial or complete\nmechanical or nonmechanical blockage of the small orlarge intestine.\nDescription\nThere are two types of intestinal obstructions—\nmechanical and nonmechanical. Mechanical obstructionsoccur because the bowel is physically blocked and itscontents cannot get past the obstruction. Mechanicalobstructions can occur for several reasons. Sometimes thebowel twists on itself (volvulus) or telescopes into itself(intussusception ). Mechanical obstruction can also result\nfrom hernias, impacted feces, abnormal tissue growth, thepresence of foreign bodies in the intestines, or inflamma-tory bowel disease ( Crohn’s disease ). Nonmechanical\nobstruction, called ileus , occurs because the wavelike\nmuscular contractions of the intestine (peristalsis) thatordinarily move food through the digestive tract stop.\nMechanical obstruction in infants\nInfants under one year of age are most likely to have\nintestinal obstruction caused by meconium ileus, volvu-lus, and intussusception. Meconium ileus, which is theinability to pass the first fecal excretion after birth(meconium), is a disorder of newborns. It is an early cluethat the infant has cystic fibrosis . In meconium ileus, the\nmaterial that is blocking the intestine is thick and stringy,rather than the collection of mucus and bile that is passedby normal infants. The abnormal meconium must beremoved with an enema or through surgery.\nV olvulus is the twisting of either the small or large\nbowel. The twisting may cut off the blood supply to thebowel, leading to tissue death (gangrene ). This develop-\nment is called a strangulating obstruction.In intussusception, the bowel telescopes into itself\nlike a radio antenna folding up. Intussusception is mostcommon in children between the ages of three and ninemonths, although it also occurs in older children. Almosttwice as many boys suffer intussusception as girls. It is,however, difficult for doctors to predict which infantswill suffer from intestinal obstruction.\nMechanical obstruction in adults\nObstructions in adults are usually caused by\ntumors, trauma, volvulus, the presence of foreign bod-ies such as gallstones , or hernias. V olvulus occurs\nmost often in elderly adults and psychiatrically dis-turbed patients. Intussusception in adults is usuallyassociated with tumors in the bowel, whether benign ormalignant.\nCauses and symptoms\nOne of the earliest signs of mechanical intestinal\nobstruction is abdominal pain or cramps that come and\ngo in waves. Infants typically pull up their legs and cryin pain, then stop crying suddenly. They will thenbehave normally for as long as 15–30 minutes, only tostart crying again when the next cramp begins. Thecramping results from the inability of the muscular con-tractions of the bowel to push the digested food past theobstruction.\nV omiting is another symptom of intestinal obstruc-\ntion. The speed of its onset is a clue to the location of theobstruction. V omiting follows shortly after the pain ifthe obstruction is in the small intestine but is delayed ifit is in the large intestine. The vomited material may befecal in character. When the patient has a mechanicalobstruction, the doctor will first hear active, high-pitched gurgling and splashing bowel sounds while lis-tening with a stethoscope. Later these sounds decrease,then stop. If the blockage is complete, the patient willnot pass any gas or feces. If the blockage is only partial,however, the patient may have diarrhea . Initially there\nis little or no fever .\nWhen the material in the bowel cannot move past the\nobstruction, the body reabsorbs large amounts of fluidand the abdomen becomes sore to the touch and swollen.The balance of certain important chemicals (electrolytes)in the blood is upset. Persistent vomiting can cause thepatient to become dehydrated. Without treatment, thepatient can suffer shock and kidney failure.\nStrangulation occurs when a loop of the intestine is cut\noff from its blood supply. Strangulation occurs in about25% of cases of small bowel obstruction. It is a seriouscondition that can progress to gangrene within six hours.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1848Intestinal obstructionsDiagnosis\nImaging studies\nIf the doctor suspects intestinal obstruction based on\nthe physical examination and patient history, he or she\nwill order x rays, a computed tomography scan (CTscan), or an ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen. Inmany cases the patient is given a barium enema . Barium\nsulfate, which is a white powder, is inserted through therectum and the intestinal area is photographed. Bariumacts as a contrast material and allows the location of theobstruction to be pinpointed on film.\nLaboratory tests\nThe first blood test of a patient with an intestinal\nobstruction usually gives normal results, but later tests indi-cate electrolyte imbalances. There is no way to determine ifan obstruction is simple or strangulated except surgery.\nTreatment\nInitial assessment\nAll patients with suspected intestinal obstruction are\nhospitalized. Treatment must be rapid, because strangu-lating obstructions can be fatal. The first step in treat-ment is inserting a nasogastric tube to suction out thecontents of the stomach and intestines. The patient isthen given intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and\ncorrect electrolyte imbalances.\nNonsurgical approaches\nSurgery can be avoided for some patients. In some\ncases of volvulus, guiding a rectal tube into the intestineswill straighten the twisted bowels. In infants, a bariumenema may reverse intussusception in 50-90%. An airenema is sometimes used instead of a barium enema.This treatment successfully relieves the obstruction inmany infants. The children are usually hospitalized forobservation for two to three days after these procedures.In patients with only partial obstruction, a barium enemamay dissolve the blockage.\nSurgical treatment\nIf these efforts fail, surgery is necessary. Strangulated\nobstructions require emergency surgery. The obstructedarea is removed and part of the bowel is cut away. If theobstruction is caused by tumors, polyps, or scar tissue,they are removed. Hernias, if present, are repaired. Antibi-\notics are given to reduce the possibility of infection.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative practitioners offer few suggestions for\ntreatment.

Recurrences ininfants with intussusception are most likely to happenduring the first 36 hours after the blockage has beencleared. The mortality rate for unsuccessfully treatedinfants is 1–2%.\nPrevention\nMost cases of intestinal obstruction are not pre-\nventable.

    "title": "Intestinal polyps",
    "content": "Intestinal polyps\nDefinition\nThe word polyp refers to any overgrowth of tissue\nfrom the surface of mucous membranes. Intestinalpolyps grow out of the lining of the small and large bow-els. Polyps come in a variety of shapes—round, droplet,and irregular being the most common.\nDescription\nPolyps are one of many forms of tissue overproduc-\ntion that can occur in the body. Cells in many body tis-sues sometimes keep growing beyond their usual limits.Medical scientists call this process neoplasia , which\nmeans simply “new growth.” An individual overgrowth iscalled a neoplasm. In most cases these growths are limit-ed, and the result is a benign swelling or mass of cellscalled a tumor. If the new growth occurs on the surface ofthe tissue instead of inside an organ it is often called apolyp. Cancer is another type of neoplasm marked by\nunlimited tissue growth. The essential feature that distin-guishes cancer from nonmalignant neoplasms is that itdoes not stop growing.\nIntestinal polyps are a common form of neoplasm.\nAll intestinal polyps arise from the inner lining of theintestinal wall. This layer of mucosal tissue does thework of digestion. About 30% of the general populationwill develop intestinal polyps at some point in life, withthe likelihood increasing with age. Most of these polypsare never noticed during a person’s lifetime because theycause no problems. They are often discovered accidental-ly at autopsy . The primary importance of intestinal\npolyps is that 1% of them become cancerous. Becausethe polyps that eventually turn malignant cannot be iden-tified in advance, they are all suspect.Location of intestinal polyps\nThe chances of a polyp’s becoming cancerous depend\nto some extent on its location within the digestive tract.\nCOLON. Ninety-five percent of all intestinal polyps\ndevelop inside the large bowel. There are several heredi-tary diseases that produce large numbers of intestinalpolyps. These disorders include:\n• familial polyposis of the colon\n• Gardner’s syndrome• Lynch’s syndrome• Turcot’s syndrome• Peutz-Jeghers syndrome• juvenile polyposis\nAll of these disorders are inherited in what is called an\nautosomal dominant pattern. This pattern means that thedisorders are not sex-linked and that a child can inherit thedisorder from either parent. In all of these hereditary disor-ders, the intestinal polyps appear during or after puberty .\nThe first four diseases on the list have such a high rate ofcancer of the large bowel (colon)—virtually 100% by theage of 40—that persons diagnosed with any of them shouldhave the colon removed surgically in early adulthood.\nSTOMACH. The stomach’s lining is host to polyps of\na similar appearance, but there is no agreement as to theirpotential for becoming stomach cancer .\nSMALL INTESTINE. Polyps in the small bowel do not\nseem to have malignant potential. Instead they can pro-duce obstruction in either of two ways. A large polyp canobstruct the bowel by its sheer size. Smaller polyps canbe picked up by the rhythmic contractions (peristalsis) ofthe intestines and pull the part of the bowel to which theyare attached into the adjoining section. The result is atelescoping of one section of bowel into another, calledintussusception .\nCauses and symptoms\nPopulation studies of colon cancer suggest that diet\nplays an important role in the disease, and by implicationin the formation of colon polyps. The most consistentinterpretation of these data is that animal fats—thoughnot vegetable fats—are the single most important dietaryfactor. Lack of fiber in the diet may also contribute topolyp formation. Other types of polyps are too rare toproduce enough data for evaluation.\nMost polyps cause no symptoms. Large ones eventu-\nally cause intestinal obstruction, which produces cramp-ing abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting . As\ncolon polyps evolve into cancers, they begin to producesymptoms that include bleeding and altered bowel habits.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1850Intestinal polypsDiagnosis\nRoutine screening for bowel cancer is recommended\nfor everyone over the age of 40. Screening may be assimple as testing the stool for blood or as elaborate ascolonoscopy . Colonoscopy is a procedure in which the\ndoctor threads an instrument called a colonoscope upthrough the entire large bowel. Most polyps are in thelower segment of the colon, called the sigmoid colon.These polyps can be seen with a shorter scope called asigmoidoscope. X ray imaging can also used to look forpolyps. For x rays, the colon is first filled with barium,which is a white substance that shows up as a shadowedarea on the film. The colon can also be filled with bariumand air, which is called a double contrast study.\nBecause polyps take about five years to turn into\ncancers, routine examinations are recommended everythree years.\nTreatment\nAll polyps should be removed as preventive care.\nMost of them can be taken out through a colonoscope.Complications like obstruction and intussusception aresurgical emergencies.\nPrevention\nPatients with hereditary disorders associated with\npolyps must undergo total colectomy early in adult life. AllKEY TERMS\nAutosomal dominance —A pattern of heredity in\nwhich a trait is inherited without respect to sexand from either parent. The hereditary diseasesassociated with intestinal polyps are all autosomaldominant.\nColectomy —Surgical removal of the large bowel.\nIntussusception —The slipping of one section of\nthe intestine inside an adjoining section. Intussus-ception can be caused by small intestinal polyps.\nMucosal —Refers to tissues that produce mucus,\nsuch as the digestive, genital and urinary tracts.\nNeoplasm —A new growth of abnormal tissue.\nPeristalsis —The rhythmic contractions of muscu-\nlar tubes like the intestines that carry the contentsalong the tube.\nSigmoid —The S-shaped curve of the large intes-\ntine where the colon joins the rectum.children of parents with these disorders should be screened\nearly in adulthood, because half of them will have the samedisease. For the bulk of the population, increased dietaryfiber and decreased animal fat are the best preventivesknown at present. For the occasional intestinal polyp thatarises in spite of good dietary habits, routine screeningshould prevent it from becoming cancerous.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLevin, Bernard. “Neoplasms of the Large and Small\nIntestines.” In Cecil Textbook of Medicine , ed.

When the baby’sweight is at or below the tenth percentile for his or herage, it is called intrauterine growth retardation or fetalgrowth restriction. These babies are smaller than they\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1851Intrauterine growth retardationshould be for their age. How much a baby weighs at birth\ndepends not only on how many weeks old it is, but therate at which it has grown. This growth process is com-plex and delicate. There are three phases associated withthe development of the baby. During the first phase, cellsmultiply in the baby’s organs. This occurs from the begin-ning of development through the early part of the fourthmonth. During the second phase, cells continue to multi-ply and the organs grow. In the third phase (after 32weeks of development), growth occurs quickly and thebaby may gain as much as 7 ounces per week. If the deli-cate process of development and weight gain is disturbedor interrupted, the baby can suffer from restricted growth.\nIUGR is usually classified as symmetrical or asym-\nmetrical. In symmetrical IUGR, the baby’s head andbody are proportionately small. In asymmetrical IUGR,the baby’s brain is abnormally large when compared tothe liver. In a normal infant, the brain weighs about threetimes more than the liver. In asymmetrical IUGR, thebrain can weigh five or six times more than the liver.\nCauses and symptoms\nDoctors think that the two types of IUGR may be\nlinked to the time during development that the problemoccurs. Symmetrical IUGR may occur when the unbornbaby experiences a problem during early development.Asymmetrical IUGR may occur when the unborn babyexperiences a problem during later development. Whilenot true for all asymmetrical cases, doctors think thatsometimes the placenta may allow the brain to get moreoxygen and nutrition while the liver gets less.\nThere are many IUGR risk factors involving the\nmother and the baby. A mother is at risk for having agrowth restricted infant if she:\n• has had a previous baby who suffered from IUGR\n• is small in size• has poor weight gain and nutrition during pregnancy\n• is socially deprived\n• uses substances (like tobacco, narcotics, alcohol) that\ncan cause abnormal development or birth defects\n• has a vascular disease (like preeclampsia)• has chronic kidney disease• has a low total blood volume during early pregnancy• is pregnant with more than one baby\n• has an antibody problem that can make successful preg-\nnancy difficult (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome)\nAdditionally, an unborn baby may suffer from IUGR\nif it has:• exposure to an infection, including German measles\n(rubella ), cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis ,syphilis ,o r\ntoxoplasmosis\n• a birth defect (like a severe cardiovascular defect)\n• a chromosome defect, especially trisomy 18 ( Edwards’\nsyndrome )\n• a primary disorder of bone or cartilage• a chronic lack of oxygen during development (hypoxia)\n• placenta or umbilical cord defects\n• developed outside of the uterus\nDiagnosis\nIUGR can be difficult to diagnose and in many cases\ndoctors are not able to make an exact diagnosis until thebaby is born. A mother who has had a growth-restrictedbaby is at risk of having another during a later pregnancy.Such mothers are closely monitored during pregnancy.The length in weeks of the pregnancy must be carefullydetermined so that the doctor will know if developmentand weight gain are appropriate. Checking the mother’sweight and abdomen measurements can help diagnosecases when there are no other risk factors present. Mea-suring the girth of the abdomen is often used as a tool fordiagnosing IUGR. During pregnancy, the health careprovider will use a tape measure to record the height ofthe upper portion of the uterus (the uterine fundalheight). As the pregnancy continues and the baby grows,the uterus stretches upward in the direction of the moth-er’s head. Between 18 and 30 weeks of gestation, theuterine fundal height (in cm.) equals the weeks of gesta-tion. If the uterine fundal height is more than 2–3 cmbelow normal, then IUGR is suspected. Ultrasound isused to evaluate the growth of the baby. Usually, IUGR isdiagnosed after week 32 of pregnancy. This is during thephase of rapid growth when the baby should be gainingmore weight. IUGR caused by genetic factors or infec-tion may sometimes be detected earlier.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment that improves fetal growth, but\nIUGR babies who are at or near term have the best out-come if delivered promptly. If IUGR is caused by a prob-lem with the placenta and the baby is otherwise healthy,early diagnosis and treatment of the problem may reducethe chance of a serious outcome.\nPrognosis\nBabies who suffer from IUGR are at an increased\nrisk for death , low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ), low\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1852Intrauterine growth retardationbody temperature ( hypothermia ), and abnormal devel-\nopment of the nervous system. These risks increase withthe severity of the growth restriction. The growth thatoccurs after birth cannot be predicted with certaintybased on the size of the baby when it is born. Infants withasymmetrical IUGR are more likely to catch up ingrowth after birth than are infants who suffer from pro-longed symmetrical IUGR. However, as of 1998, doctorscannot reliably predict an infant’s future progress. Eachcase is unique. Some infants who have IUGR will devel-op normally, while others will have complications of thenervous system or intellectual problems like learning\ndisorders . If IUGR is related to a disease or a genetic\ndefect, the future of the infant is related to the severityand the nature of that disorder.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCunningham, F. Gary, et al.

Infants and childrenare especially vulnerable to dehydration . Patients can\nbecome dehydrated due to an illness, surgery, or acci-dent. Athletes who have overexerted themselves mayalso require rehydration with IV fluids. An IV for rehy-dration can be used for several hours to several days, andis generally used if a patient cannot drink fluids.KEY TERMS\nIntravenous —Into a vein; a needle is inserted into\na vein in the back of the hand, inside the elbow, orsome other location on the body. Fluids, nutrients,and drugs can be injected.\nPrecautions\nPatients receiving IV therapy need to be monitored\nto ensure that the IV solutions are providing the correctamounts of fluids and minerals needed. People with kid-\nney and heart disease are at increased risk for overhy-\ndration , so they must be carefully monitored when\nreceiving IV therapy.\nDescription\nBasic IV solutions are sterile water with small\namounts of sodium (salt) or dextrose (sugar) supplied inbottles or thick plastic bags that can hang on a standmounted next to the patient’s bed. Additional mineralslike potassium and calcium, vitamins , or drugs can be\nadded to the IV solution by injecting them into the bottleor bag with a needle.\nPreparation\nA doctor orders the IV solution and any additional\nnutrients or drugs to be added to it. The doctor also spec-ifies the rate at which the IV will be infused. The IVsolutions are prepared under the supervision of a doctor,pharmacist, or nurse, using sanitary techniques that pre-vent bacterial contamination. Just like a prescription, theIV is clearly labeled to show its contents and the amountsof any additives. The skin around the area where the nee-dle is inserted is cleaned and disinfected. Once the nee-dle is in place, it will be taped to the skin to prevent itfrom dislodging.\nAftercare\nPatients need to take fluids by mouth before an IV\nsolution is discontinued. After the IV needle is removed,the site should be inspected for any signs of bleeding orinfection.\nRisks\nThere is a small risk of infection at the injection site.\nIt is possible that the IV solution may not provide all ofthe nutrients needed, leading to a deficiency or an imbal-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1853Intravenous rehydrationance.

    "title": "Intravenous urography",
    "content": "Intravenous urography\nDefinition\nIntravenous urography is a test that x rays the urinary\nsystem using intravenous dye for diagnostic purposes.\nOf the many ways to obtain images of the urinary\nsystem, the intravenous injection of a contrast agent hasbeen traditionally considered the best. The kidneysexcrete the dye into the urine. X rays can then create pic-tures of every structure through which the urine passes.\nThe procedure has several variations and many\nnames:\n• intravenous pyelography (IVP)• urography\n• pyelography\n• antegrade pyelography differentiates this procedure\nfrom “retrograde pyelography,” which injects dye intothe lower end of the system, therefore flowing back-ward or “retrograde.” Retrograde pyelography is betterable to define problems in the lower parts of the systemand is the only way to get x rays if the kidneys are notworking well.• Nephrotomography is somewhat different in that the x\nrays are taken by a moving x ray source onto a film mov-ing in the opposite direction. By accurately coordinatingthe movement, all but a single plane of tissue is blurred,and that plane is seen without overlying shadows.\nEvery method available gives good pictures of this\nsystem, and the question becomes one of choosingamong many excellent alternatives. Each condition hasspecial requirements, while each technique has distinc-tive benefits and drawbacks.\n• Nuclear scans rely on the radiation given off by certain\natoms. Chemicals containing such atoms are injectedinto the bloodstream. They reach the kidneys, whereimages are constructed by measuring the radiationemitted. The radiation is no more dangerous than stan-dard x rays. The images require considerable training tointerpret, but unique information is often availableusing this technology. Different chemicals can concen-trate the radiation in different types of tissue. This tech-nique may require several days for the chemical to con-centrate at its destination. It also requires a specialdetector to create the image.\n• Ultrasound is a quick, safe, simple, and inexpensive\nway to obtain views of internal organs. Although lessdetailed than other methods, it may be sufficient.\n• Retrograde pyelography is better able to define prob-\nlems in the lower parts of the system and is the onlyway to get x rays if the kidneys are not working well.Dye is usually injected through an instrument (cysto-scope) passed into the bladder through the urethra.\n• Computed tomography scans (CT or CAT scanning)\nuses the same kind of radiation used in x rays, but itcollects information by computer in such a way thatthree-dimensional images can be constructed, eliminat-ing interference from nearby structures. CT scanningrequires a special apparatus.\n• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnetic\nfields and radio frequency signals, instead of ionizingradiation, to create computerized images. This form ofenergy is entirely safe as long as the patient has nometal on board. The technique is far more versatile thanCT scanning. MRI requires special apparatus and,because of the powerful magnets needed, even a specialbuilding all by itself. It is quite expensive.\nPurpose\nMost diseases of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder will\nyield information to this procedure, which actually hastwo phases. First, it requires a functioning kidney to filterthe dye out of the blood into the urine. The time requiredfor the dye to appear on x rays correlates accurately with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1854Intravenous urographykidney function. The second phase gives detailed anatomi-\ncal images of the urinary tract. Within the first few minutesthe dye “lights up” the kidneys, a phase called the nephro-gram. Subsequent pictures follow the dye down the uretersand into the bladder. A final film taken after urinatingreveals how well the bladder empties.\nIVPs are most often done to assess structural abnor-\nmalities or obstruction to urine flow. If kidney function isat issue, more films are taken sooner to catch the earliestphase of the process.\n• Stones, tumors and congenital malformations account\nfor many of the findings.\n• Kidney cysts and cancers can be seen.\n• Displacement of a kidney or ureter suggests a space-\noccupying lesion like a cancer pushing it out of the way.\n• Bad valves where the ureters enter the bladder will\noften show up.\n• Bladder cancers and other abnormalities are often out-\nlined by the dye in the bladder.\n• An enlarged prostate gland will show up as incom-\nplete bladder emptying and a bump at the bottom of thebladder.\nPrecautions\nThe only serious complication of an IVP is allergy\nto the iodine-containing dye that is used. Such an allergyis rare, but it can be dramatic and even lethal. Emergencymeasures taken immediately are usually effective.\nDescription\nIVPs are usually done in the morning. In the x ray\nsuite, the patient will undress and lie down. There aretwo methods of injecting the dye. An intravenous linecan be established, through which the dye will be consis-tently fed through the body during the procedure. Theother method is to give the dye all at once through a nee-dle that is immediately withdrawn. X rays are taken untilthe dye has reached the bladder, an interval of half anhour or less. The patient will be asked to empty the blad-der before one last x ray.KEY TERMS\nContrast agent —Any substance that causes shad-\nows on x rays; also known as contrast dye ormedium.\nIntravenous —Into a vein.Preparation\nEmptying the bowel with laxatives or enemas pre-\nvents bowel shadows from obscuring the details of theurinary system. An empty stomach prevents the compli-cations of vomiting, a rare effect of the contrast agent.Therefore, the night before the IVP the patient will beasked to evacuate the bowels and to drink sparingly.\nRisks\nAllergy to the contrast agent is the only risk. Anyone\nwith a possible iodine allergy or a previous reaction to xray dye must be particularly careful to inform the x raypersonnel.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMerrill, Vinta.

    "title": "Intussusception",
    "content": "Intussusception\nDefinition\nIntussusception is the enfolding of one segment of\nthe intestine within another. It is characterized by andinitially presents with recurring attacks of crampingabdominal pain that gradually become more painful.\nDescription\nIntussusception occurs when part of the bowel or\nintestine is wrapped around itself, producing a mass-likeobject on the right side of the abdomen during palpation(a procedure used during a physical examination , when\nthe examiner touches the abdomen with his/her hand,usually feeling for mass, pain, or discomfort). The num-ber of new cases of intussusception is approximately 1.5to four cases per 1,000 live births. The onset of abdomi-nal pain is usually abrupt and severe. Just as fast as theonset of pain appears, it disappears and the child resumesactivity normally. This process of sudden severe abdomi-nal pain appearing out of the blue, then disappearing, isrepeated with duration of painful attacks. The pain usual-ly increases after approximately five hours of recurrentcycles of severe abdominal pain followed by relaxation.V omiting and diarrhea occur in about 90% of cases\nwithin six to 12 hours after initial onset of symptoms.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1855IntussusceptionPhysical examination and palpation usually reveal a\nsausage-shaped mass of enfolded bowel in the right uppermid-portion of the abdomen. Within a few hours approxi-mately 50% of cases have bloody, mucus-filled bowelmovements. At about this time the child is visibly very illwith fever , tenderness, and distended abdomen. Intussus-\nception is the most frequent cause of intestinal obstruc-tion during the first two years of life and commonlyaffects children between three to 12 months of age. Thedisease is three times more common in males than infemales. In about 85% of cases the cause is idiopathic(meaning that it is unknown). The remaining 15% ofcases can be caused by a variety of such other diseases astumors of the lymph nodes (lymphoma), fat tumors (lipo-mas), foreign bodies/objects, or from infections thatmobilize immune cells to the area causing and an inflam-matory reaction and intestinal blockage. Most cases ofintussusception do not strangulate the affected bowelwithin the first 24 hours. If the disease is not treated afterthis time, the possibility of intestinal gangrene ,shock ,\nand death increases.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe major symptom of intussusception is that a\nhealthy child suddenly and without warning experiencessevere abdominal pain that subsides and usually results incontinuation of such normal activities as playing. The dura-tion of the painful attacks increases as the hours go by.Usually, the child develops nausea, vomiting, and diarrheasoon afterwards in about 90% of all cases. The childbecomes weak, exhausted, and develops a fever. The affect-ed child may also expel bloody, mucus-like bowel move-ments. These blood-filled bowel movements are usuallydue to impaired blood flow to the obstructed area. Duringpalpation there may be a sausage-shaped mass located onthe upper right mid portion of the abdomen. If the diseaseprogresses and is undetected, the child may develop necro-sis (death) of cells within the affected area. Additionally,there may be perforation or holes in the intussusceptionbowel that can cause a life threatening infection in the peri-toneum (a layer of tissue that protects the organs andintestines within the abdominal cavity). This infection ofthe peritoneum is called peritonitis . Some patients may\nexhibit altered states of consciousness or seizures.\nDiagnosis\nA presumed diagnosis can be made by history alone.\nIf the clinician suspects intussusception x-ray filmsshould be performed, which may reveal a mass in theright upper mid abdominal region. Two classical clinicalsigns are mucus-blood filled stools and a “coiled string”appearance in the affected bowel as visualized during anx ray with a barium enema . Blood chemistry analysis isnot specific for intussusception. Depending on vomiting\nand blood loss through the stools, blood chemistry mayreflect signs of dehydration and anemia.\nTreatment\nTreating intussusception by reduction (alleviating the\nsource of blockage) is an emergency procedure. The bari-um examination is not only the diagnostic tool of choice,but also frequently curative. Infusion by gravity from acatheter placed in the rectum will tend to relieve pressurebuildup. If this does not relieve the area, then air can bepumped into the colon to clear blockage. If these proce-dures are unsuccessful then surgery is required. Approxi-mately 25% of affected children require surgical interven-tion. Surgery in the affected bowel is advantageous sincethe actual cause can be removed, and the proceduredecreases the possibility of recurrences. In general, with-out surgical correction of the affected bowel, there is a5–10% chance of recurrence. Recurrence usually appearswithin the first 24 to 48 hours after barium procedure.\nPrognosis\nThe outcome of intussusception depends on the\nduration of symptoms before treatment initiation. Mostinfants will recover if treatment is initiated within thefirst 24 hours. Untreated intussusception is almostalways fatal. Overall even with treatment, approximately1–2% of affected children will die.\nPrevention\nPrevention of death can be accomplished with\nimmediate medical care, within the first 24 hours. Onceintussusception is suspected, emergency measuresshould be initiated. Untreated intussusception is almostalways fatal. There is an increased chance of death if thedisorder is not treated within 48 hours.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBehrman, Richard E., et al, eds. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics.\n16th ed. Philadelphia: W. B.

    "title": "Ipecac",
    "content": "Ipecac\nDefinition\nIpecac is a medicine commonly used to induce vom-\niting in cases of accidental poisoning . It is also a homeo-\npathic remedy.\nPurpose\nTreatment of poisoning\nStandard medical practice uses ipecac to cause vom-\niting in cases of poisoning in order to remove the toxicsubstance from the stomach before absorption occurs. Itcan be used on animals as well as humans. Ipecac is saferand more effective than many other methods for inducingvomiting, such as sticking a finger down a child’s throator using salt water. There are times, however, whenipecac should not be used because it can make certainkinds of poisoning worse. Syrup of ipecac should not beused if the poison is one of the following.\n• strychnine• alkalis (lye)\n• strong acids\n• kerosene\n• fuel oilKEY TERMS\nBarium — A chemical used in certain radiological\nstudies to enhance visualization of anatomicalstructures.\nObstruction — A blockage that prevents move-\nment.• gasoline\n• coal oil• paint thinner• cleaning fluid\nPoisoning is a potentially serious condition. It is best\nto contact a local poison control center, local hospitalemergency room, or the family doctor for instructionsbefore using syrup of ipecac.\nIpecac’s reputation for inducing vomiting has\nencouraged some bulimics to take it on a regular basis inorder to purge the contents of the stomach after an eatingbinge. This misuse of ipecac is extremely dangerous; itcan cause heart problems, tears in the esophagus or stom-ach lining, vomiting blood, seizures, or even death .\nHomeopathy\nThe homeopathic remedy made from ipecac is\ncalled Ipecacuanha . Homeopathic preparations are given\nfor a reason completely opposite from that of standardallopathic treatment. In homeopathy , ipecac is given to\nstop vomiting rather than to induce it. According to Hah-nemann’s law of similars, a substance that would causevomiting in large doses when given to a healthy personwill stimulate a sick person’s natural defenses whengiven in extremely dilute and carefully prepared doses.Ipecacuanha is a favorite homeopathic remedy for morn-\ning sickness associated with pregnancy . It is also given\nto stop nausea that is not relieved by vomiting; when thevomitus is slimy and white; when there is gagging andheavy salivation; when the tongue is clean despite thepatient’s feelings of nausea; and when the patient is notthirsty. The nausea may be accompanied by a headache ,\ncough , or heavy menstrual bleeding. The modalities (cir-\ncumstances) that suggest Ipecacuanha as the appropriate\nhomeopathic remedy is that the patient feels worse lyingdown; in dry weather; in winter; and when exercising ormoving about.\nA homeopathic practitioner would not necessarily\nprescribe ipecac for all cases of nausea. Arsenicum\nwould be given when the nausea is caused by food poi-\nsoning and accompanied by strong thirst, Nux vomica\nwhen the nausea is the result of overindulgence in foodor alcohol and accompanied by gas or heartburn . A sick\nchild might be given Pulsatilla , particularly if rich foods\nhave been eaten.\nOn the other hand, a homeopathic practitioner may\nprescribe ipecac for any of the following conditions thatare not related to nausea and vomiting .\n• nosebleeds producing bright red blood• dental bleeding\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1857Ipecac• diarrhea with cramping abdominal pain , the stools are\ngreen with froth or foam.\n• asthma of sudden onset; the patient has to sit up in\norder to breathe, but cannot bring up any mucus in spiteof violent coughing\n• hoarseness or loss of voice following a cold\n• physical or mental exhaustion\nDescription\nThe medicinal effects of ipecac were recognized\ncenturies ago by the Portuguese who settled in SouthAmerica. They found a plant that can make people vomitand appropriately named it Caephalis ipecacuanha ,\nmeaning sick-making plant. Syrup of ipecac is now con-sidered the safest drug to treat poisoning and is often themost effective. There are different types of ipecac prepa-rations that vary greatly in strength. Syrup of ipecac isbest for use at home to treat accidental poisoning. Ipecacfluid extract and ipecac tincture should be avoided asthey are much stronger compounds and can be toxic.\nIpecacuanha is a homeopathic remedy made from\nipecac by a process of dilution and succussion (shaking). Incontrast to syrup of ipecac, it is given to relieve vomiting.\nRecommended dosage\nSyrup of ipecac\nSyrup of ipecac is made from the dried roots and rhi-\nzomes (underground stems) of Cephaelis ipecacuanha . It is\navailable over the counter in 0.5–1 oz bottles. Larger bot-tles require a doctor’s prescription. The dosage for infantsunder 6 months old should be prescribed by the family doc-tor or poison control center. For children six months to oneyear, the usual dose is 5–10 ml or 1–2 tsp. One-half or onefull glass (4–8 oz) of water should be taken immediatelybefore or after the dose. The dose may be repeated once\nafter 20–30 minutes if vomiting does not occur. For chil-dren one to 12 years of age, the usual dose is 15 ml (1 tbsp)to be taken with one full glass (8 oz) of water. Adults andteenagers should take 15–30 ml of ipecac with at least 1full glass of water. Syrup of ipecac should not be taken withmilk or soda drinks as these foods may prevent it fromworking properly. If vomiting does not occur within 20–30minutes after the first dose, a second dose may be needed.If the second dose fails to induce vomiting, the patientshould be taken to a hospital emergency room.\nIf both activated charcoal and syrup of ipecac are\nrecommended to treat poison, ipecac must be used first.Activated charcoal should not be taken until 30 minutesafter taking syrup of ipecac, or until the vomiting causedby ipecac stops.\nHomeopathic preparations\nIpecacuanha is available as an over-the-counter\nremedy in 30x potency. This is a decimal potency, whichmeans that one part of ipecac has been mixed with nineparts of alcohol or water; 30x means that this decimaldilution has been repeated 30 times. The dilute solutionof ipecac is then added to sugar tablets so that the remedycan be taken in tablet form.\nPrecautions\nSyrup of ipecac\nFor inducing vomiting in cases of accidental poison-\ning, only the syrup form of ipecac should be used. Syrupof ipecac should not be mixed with milk or carbonateddrinks as they may prevent vomiting.\nSyrup of ipecac should not be used in the following\nsituations (contact poison control center or family doctorfor alternative treatments).\n• poisoning caused by strychnine; sustained-release theo-\nphylline; such corrosive substances as strong alkalis(lye); strong acids (such as toilet bowl cleaner); andsuch petroleum products as kerosene, gasoline, coal oil,fuel oil, paint thinner, or cleaning fluids\n• overdoses of medications given for depression• excessive vomiting• a serious heart condition\n• timing. Do not give ipecac more than four to six hours\nafter the poison was ingested\n• pregnancy• very young children (less than six months old).

The\nterm iron deficiency anemia means anemia that is due toiron deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia is characterizedby the production of small red blood cells. When exam-ined under a microscope, the red blood cells also appearpale or light-colored. For this reason, the anemia thatoccurs with iron deficiency is also called hypochromicmicrocytic anemia.\nDescription\nIron deficiency anemia is the most common type of\nanemia throughout the world. In the United States, irondeficiency anemia occurs to a lesser extent than in devel-oping countries because of the higher consumption of redmeat and the practice of food fortification (addition ofiron to foods by the manufacturer). Anemia in the UnitedStates is caused by a variety of sources, including exces-sive losses of iron in menstrual fluid and excessive bleed-ing in the gastrointestinal tract. In developing countrieslocated in tropical climates, the most common cause ofiron deficiency anemia is infestation with hookworm.\nCauses and symptoms\nInfancy is a period of increased risk for iron defi-\nciency. The human infant is born with a built-in supply ofiron, which can be tapped during periods of drinkinglow-iron milk or formula. Both human milk and cowmilk contain rather low levels of iron (0.5–1.0 mgiron/liter). However, the iron in human milk is about50% absorbed by the infant, while the iron of cow milk isonly 10% absorbed. During the first six months of life,growth of the infant is made possible by the milk in thediet and by the infant’s built-in supply. However, prema-ture infants have a lower supply of iron and, for this rea-son, it is recommended that preterm infants (beginning attwo months of age) be given oral supplements of 7 mgiron/day, as ferrous sulfate. Iron deficiency can be pro-voked where infants are fed formulas that are based onunfortified cow milk. For example, unfortified cow milkis given free of charge to mothers in Chile. This practicehas the fortunate result of preventing general malnutri-\ntion, but the unfortunate result of allowing the develop-\nment of mild iron deficiency.\nThe normal rate of blood loss in the feces is 0.5–1.0\nml per day. These losses can increase with colorectalcancer . About 60% of colorectal cancers result in further\nblood losses, where the extent of blood loss is 2–10ml/day. Cancer of the colon and rectum can provokelosses of blood, resulting in iron deficiency anemia. Thefecal blood test is widely used to screen for the presenceof cancer of the colon or rectum. In the absence of test-ing, colorectal cancer may be first detected because ofthe resulting iron deficiency anemia.\nInfestation with hookworm can provoke iron defi-\nciency and iron deficiency anemia. The hookworm is aparasitic worm. It thrives in warm climates, including thesouthern United States. The hookworm enters the bodythrough the skin, through the soles of bare feet. Thehookworm then migrates to the small intestines where itattaches itself to the villi (small sausage-shaped struc-tures in the intestines that are used for the absorption ofall nutrients). The hookworm damages the villi, resultingin blood loss, and they produce anti-coagulants that pro-mote continued bleeding. Each worm can provoke theloss of up to 0.25 ml of blood per day.\nBleeding and blood losses through gastrointestinal\ntract can be provoked by colorectal cancer and hook-worms, as mentioned above, but also by hemorrhoids ,\nanal fissures, irritable bowel syndrome , aspirin-\ninduced bleeding, blood clotting disorders, and divertic-ulosis (a condition caused by an abnormal opening fromthe intestine or bladder). Several genetic diseases existthat lead to bleeding disorders, and these include hemo-\nphilia A, hemophilia B, and von Willebrand’s disease.\nOf these, only von Willebrand’s disease leads to gas-trointestinal bleeding.\nThe symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include\nweakness and fatigue . These symptoms result from dys-\nfunction of the red blood cells, and the reduced ability ofthe red blood cells to carry iron to exercising muscles.Iron deficiency can also affect other tissues, includingthe tongue and fingernails. Prolonged iron deficiency canresult in changes of the tongue, and it may becomesmooth, shiny, and reddened. This condition is calledglossitis. The fingernails may grow abnormally, andacquire a spoon-shaped appearance.\nDecreased iron intake is a contributing factor in iron\ndeficiency and iron deficiency anemia. The iron contentof cabbage, for example, is about 1.6 mg/kg food, whilethose of spinach (33 mg/kg), lima beans (15 mg/kg), pota-to (14 mg/kg), tomato (3 mg/kg), apples (1.5 mg/kg),raisins (20 mg/kg), whole wheat bread (43 mg/kg), eggs(20 mg/kg), canned tuna (13 mg/kg), chicken (11 mg/kg),beef (28 mg/kg), corn oil (0.6 mg/kg), and peanut butter(6.0 mg/kg), are indicated. One can see that apples, toma-toes, and vegetable oil are relatively low in iron, whilewhole wheat bread and beef are relatively high in iron.The assessment of whether a food is low or high in ironcan also be made by comparing the amount of that food\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1860Iron deficiency anemiaeaten per day with the recommended dietary allowance\n(RDA) for iron. The RDA for iron for the adult male is 10mg/day, while that for the adult woman is 15 mg/day. TheRDA during pregnancy is 30 mg/day. The RDA for\ninfants of 0–0.5 years of age is 6 mg/day, while that forinfants of 0.5–1.0 years of age is 10 mg/day. The RDAvalues are based on the assumption that the consumer eatsa mixture of plant and animal foods.\nThe above list of iron values alone may be decep-\ntive, since the availability of iron in fruits, vegetables,and grains is very low, while the availability from meatis much higher. The availability of iron in plants rangesfrom only 1–10%, while that in meat, fish, chicken, andliver is 20–30%. The term availability means the per-cent of dietary iron that is absorbed via the gastroin-testinal tract to the bloodstream. Non-absorbed iron islost in the feces.\nInteractions between various foods can influence the\nabsorption of dietary iron. Vitamin C can increase theabsorption of dietary iron. Orange juice is a rich sourceof vitamin C. Thus, if a plant food, such as rice, is con-sumed with orange juice, then the orange juice canenhance the absorption of the iron in the rice. Vitamin Cis also added to infant formulas, and the increased use offormulas fortified with both iron and vitamin C have ledto a marked decline in anemia in infants and young chil-dren in the United States (Dallman, 1989). In contrast, ifrice is consumed with tea, certain chemicals in the tea(tannins) can reduce the absorption of the iron. Phyticacid is a chemical that naturally occurs in legumes, cere-als, and nuts. Phytic acid, which can account for 1–5% ofthe weight of these foods, is a potent inhibitor of ironabsorption. The increased availability of the iron in meatproducts is partly due to the fact that heme-iron isabsorbed to a greater extent than free iron salts, and to agreater extent than iron in the phytic acid/iron complex.Nearly all of the iron in plants is nonheme-iron. Much ofthe iron in meat is nonheme-iron as well. The nonheme-iron in meat, fish, chicken and liver may be about 20%available. The heme-iron of meat may be close to 30%available. The most available source of iron is humanmilk (50% availability).\nDiagnosis\nIron deficiency anemia in infants is defined as a\nhemoglobin level below 109 mg/ml of whole blood, anda hematocrit below 33%. Anemia in adult males is\ndefined as a hemoglobin under 130 mg/ml and a hemat-ocrit below 38%. Anemia in adult females is defined ashemoglobin under 120 mg/ml and a hematocrit below32%. Anemia in pregnant women is defined as hemoglo-bin of under 110 mg/ml and hematocrit below 31%.When an abnormally high presence of blood is found\nin the feces during a fecal occult blood test , the physician\nneeds to examine the gastrointestinal tract to determine thecause of bleeding. Here, the diagnosis for iron deficiencyanemia includes an examination using a sigmoidoscope.The sigmoidoscope is an instrument that consists of a flex-ible tube that permits examination of the colon to a dis-tance of 60 cm. A barium enema , with an x ray, may also\nbe used to detect abnormalities that can cause bleeding.\nThe diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia should\ninclude a test for oral iron absorption, where evidencesuggests that oral iron supplements fail in treating ane-mia. The oral iron absorption test is conducted by eating64 mg iron (325 mg ferrous sulfate) in a single dose.Blood samples are then taken after two hours and fourhours. The iron content of the blood serum is then mea-sured. The concentration of iron should rise by an incre-ment of about 22 micromolar, where iron absorption isnormal. Lesser increases in concentration mean that ironabsorption is abnormal, and that therapy should involveinjections or infusions of iron.\nTreatment\nOral iron supplements (pills) may contain various\niron salts. These iron salts include ferrous sulfate, ferrousgluconate, or ferrous fumarate. Injections and infusionsof iron can be carried out with a preparation called irondextran. In patients with poor iron absorption (by thegut), therapy with injection or infusion is preferable overoral supplements. Treatment of iron deficiency anemiasometimes requires more than therapy with iron. Whereiron deficiency was provoked by hemorrhoids, surgerymay prove essential to prevent recurrent iron deficiencyanemia. Where iron deficiency is provoked by bleedingdue to aspirin treatment, aspirin should be discontinued.\nWhere iron deficiency is provoked by hookworm infec-tions, therapy for this parasite should be used, along withprotection of the feet by wearing shoes whenever walk-ing in hookworm-infested soil.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for treating and curing iron deficiency\nanemia is excellent. Perhaps the main problem is failureto take iron supplements. In cases of pregnant women, thehealth care worker may recommend taking 100–200 mgiron/day. This dose is rather high, and can lead to nausea,diarrhea , or abdominal pain in 10–20 % of women tak-\ning this dose. The reason for using this high dose is toeffect a rapid cure for anemia, where the anemia is detect-ed at a midpoint during the pregnancy. The above prob-lems of side effects and noncompliance can be avoided bytaking iron doses (100–200 mg) only once a week, where\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1861Iron deficiency anemiasupplements are initiated some time prior to conception,\nor continuously throughout the fertile period of life. Theproblem of compliance is not an issue where infusions areused; however, a fraction of patients treated with ironinfusions experience side effects, such as flushing,headache , nausea, anaphylaxis , or seizures. A number of\nstudies have shown that iron deficiency anemia in infancycan result in reduced intelligence, where intelligence wasmeasured in early childhood. It is not certain if iron sup-plementation of children with reduced intelligence, due toiron deficiency anemia in infancy, has any influence inallowing a “catch-up” in intellectual development.\nPrevention\nIn the healthy population, all of the mineral deficien-\ncies can be prevented by the consumption of inorganicnutrients at levels defined by the RDA. Iron deficiencyanemia in infants and young children can be prevented bythe use of fortified foods. Liquid cow milk-based infantformulas are generally supplemented with iron (12mg/L). The iron in liquid formulas is added as ferrous sul-fate or ferrous gluconate. Commercial infant cereals arealso fortified with iron, and here small particles of ele-KEY TERMS\nHematocrit —The proportion of whole blood in\nthe body by volume that is composed of red bloodcells.\nHemoglobin —Hemoglobin is an iron-containing\nprotein that resides within red blood cells.

    "title": "Iron tests",
    "content": "Iron tests\nDefinition\nIron tests are a group of blood tests that are done to\nevaluate the iron level in blood serum, the body’s capacityto absorb iron, and the amount of iron actually stored inthe body. Iron is an essential trace element; it is necessaryfor the formation of red blood cells and certain enzymes.At the other extreme, high levels of iron can be poisonous.\nPurpose\nThere are four different types of tests that measure\nthe body’s iron levels and storage. They are called ironlevel tests, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) tests, fer-ritin tests, and transferrin tests. These tests are given forseveral reasons:\n• to help in the differential diagnosis of different types of\nanemia\n• to assess the severity of anemia and monitor the treat-\nment of patients with chronic anemia\n• to evaluate protein depletion and other forms of malnu-\ntrition\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1862Iron tests• to check for certain liver disorders\n• to evaluate the possibility of chronic gastrointestinal\nbleeding (blood loss from the digestive tract is a com-mon cause of iron deficiency anemia)\n• to help diagnose certain unusual disorders, including\niron poisoning ,thalassemia , hemosiderosis, and hemo-\nchromatosis\nA serum iron test can be used without the others to\nevaluate cases of iron poisoning.\nPrecautions\nPatients should not have their blood tested for iron\nwithin four days of a blood transfusion or tests and\ntreatments that use radioactive materials. Recent highstress levels or sleep deprivation are additional reasons\nfor postponing iron tests.\nBlood samples for iron tests should be taken early in\nthe morning because serum iron levels vary during theday. This precaution is especially important in evaluatingthe results of iron replacement therapy.\nDescription\nIron tests are performed on samples of the patient’s\nblood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuum tube. Theamount of blood taken is between 6 mL and 10 mL (1/3of a fluid ounce). The procedure, which is called avenipuncture, takes about five minutes.\nIron level test\nThe iron level test measures the amount of iron in\nthe blood serum that is being carried by a protein (trans-ferrin) in the blood plasma.\nMedications and substances that can cause increased\niron levels include chloramphenicol, estrogen prepara-tions, dietary iron supplements, alcoholic beverages,methyldopa, and birth control pills.\nMedications that can cause decreased iron levels\ninclude ACTH, colchicine, deferoxamine, methicillin,and testosterone.\nTotal iron-binding capacity (TIBC) test\nThe TIBC test measures the amount of iron that the\nblood would carry if the transferrin were fully saturated.Since transferrin is produced by the liver, the TIBC canbe used to monitor liver function and nutrition .\nMedications that can cause increased TIBC levels\ninclude fluorides and birth control pills.\nMedications that can cause decreased TIBC levels\ninclude chloramphenicol and ACTH.Transferrin test\nThe transferrin test is a direct measurement of trans-\nferrin—which is also called siderophilin—levels in theblood. Some laboratories prefer this measurement to theTIBC. The saturation level of the transferrin can be cal-culated by dividing the serum iron level by the TIBC.\nFerritin test\nThe ferritin test measures the level of a protein in the\nblood that stores iron for later use by the body.\nMedications that can cause increased ferritin levels\ninclude dietary iron supplements. In addition, some dis-eases that do not directly affect the body’s iron storagecan cause artificially high ferritin levels. These disordersinclude infections, late-stage cancers, lymphomas, andsevere inflammations. Alcoholics often have high fer-ritin levels.\nPreparation\nPatient history\nBefore patients are tested for iron, they should be\nchecked for any of the following factors:\n• prescription medications that affect iron levels, absorp-\ntion, or storage\n• blood transfusion or radioactive medications within the\nlast four days\n• recent extreme stress or sleep deprivation\n• recent eating habits; test results can be affected by eat-\ning large amounts of iron-rich foods shortly before theblood test\nFasting\nPatients scheduled for an iron level, TIBC, or trans-\nferrin test should fast for 12 hours before the blood isdrawn. They are allowed to drink water. Patients sched-uled for a ferritin test do not need to fast but they shouldnot have any alcoholic beverages before the test.\nAftercare\nAftercare consists of routine care of the area around\nthe venipuncture.\nRisks\nThe primary risk is the possibility of a bruise or\nswelling in the area of the venipuncture. The patientcan apply moist warm compresses if there is any dis-comfort.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1863Iron testsNormal results\nIron level test\nNormal serum iron values are as follows:\n• adult males: 75–175 micrograms/dL• adult females: 65–165 micrograms/dL\n• children: 50–120 micrograms/dL\n• newborns: 100–250 micrograms/dL.\nTIBC test\nNormal TIBC values are as follows:\n• adult males: 300–400 micrograms/dL\n• adult females: 300–450 micrograms/dL.KEY TERMS\nAnemia —A disorder marked by low hemoglobin\nlevels in red blood cells, which leads to a deficien-cy of oxygen in the blood.\nFerritin —A protein found in the liver, spleen, and\nbone marrow that stores iron.\nHemochromatosis —A disorder of iron absorption\ncharacterized by bronze-colored skin.

    "title": "Irritable bowel syndrome",
    "content": "Irritable bowel syndrome\nDefinition\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common intestinal\ncondition characterized by abdominal pain and cramps;\nchanges in bowel movements ( diarrhea ,constipation ,o r\nboth); gassiness; bloating; nausea; and other symptoms.There is no cure for IBS. Much about the conditionremains unknown or poorly understood; however, dietarychanges, drugs, and psychological treatment are often ableto eliminate or substantially reduce its symptoms.\nDescription\nIBS is the name people use today for a condition that\nwas once called—among other things—colitis, mucouscolitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, spastic bowel, andfunctional bowel disorder. Some of these names reflectedthe now-outdated belief that IBS is a purely psychologi-cal disorder, a product of the patient’s imagination.Although modern medicine recognizes that stress can\ntrigger IBS attacks, medical specialists agree that IBS isa genuine physical disorder—or group of disorders—with specific identifiable characteristics.\nNo one knows for sure how many Americans suffer\nfrom IBS. Surveys indicate a range of 10-20%, with per-haps as many as 30% of Americans experiencing IBS atsome point in their lives. IBS normally makes its firstappearance during young adulthood, and in half of allcases symptoms begin before age 35. Women with IBSoutnumber men by two to one, for reasons that are not yetunderstood. IBS is responsible for more time lost fromwork and school than any medical problem other than thecommon cold . It accounts for a substantial proportion of\nthe patients seen by specialists in diseases of the digestivesystem (gastroenterologists). Yet only half—possibly asfew as 15%—of IBS sufferers ever consult a doctor.\nCauses and symptoms\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of IBS tend to rise and fall in intensity\nrather than growing steadily worse over time. Theyalways include abdominal pain, which may be relieved bydefecation; diarrhea or constipation; or diarrhea alternat-ing with constipation. Other symptoms—which varyfrom person to person—include cramps; gassiness; bloat-ing; nausea; a powerful and uncontrollable urge to defe-cate (urgency); passage of a sticky fluid (mucus) duringbowel movements; or the feeling after finishing a bowel\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1865Irritable bowel syndrome\nNormal and diseased (center) colons. Areas of constriction\nin the colon cause constipation, while areas of distentioncause diarrhea. (John Bavosi/Science Photo Library. Custom\nMedical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)movement that the bowels are still not completely empty.\nThe accepted diagnostic criteria—known as the Romecriteria—require at least three months of continuous orrecurrent symptoms before IBS can be confirmed.According to Christine B. Dalton and Douglas A. Dross-man in the American Family Physician, an estimated 70%\nof IBS cases can be described as “mild;” 25% as “moder-ate;” and 5% as “severe.” In mild cases the symptoms areslight. As a general rule, they are not present all the timeand do not interfere with work and other normal activi-ties. Moderate IBS occasionally disrupts normal activitiesand may cause some psychological problems. Peoplewith severe IBS often find living a normal life impossibleand experience crippling psychological problems as aresult. For some the physical pain is constant and intense.\nCauses\nResearchers remain unsure about the cause or causes\nof IBS. It is called a functional disorder because it isthought to result from changes in the activity of the majorpart of the large intestine (the colon). After food is digest-ed by the stomach and small intestine, the undigestedmaterial passes in liquid form into the colon, whichabsorbs water and salts. This process may take severaldays. In a healthy person the colon is quiet during most ofthat period except after meals, when its muscles contractin a series of wavelike movements called peristalsis. Peri-stalsis helps absorption by bringing the undigested mater-ial into contact with the colon wall. It also pushes undi-gested material that has been converted into solid or semi-solid feces toward the rectum, where it remains until defe-cation. In IBS, however, the normal rhythm and intensityof peristalsis is disrupted. Sometimes there is too littleperistalsis, which can slow the passage of undigestedmaterial through the colon and cause constipation. Some-times there is too much, which has the opposite effect andcauses diarrhea. A Johns Hopkins University study foundthat healthy volunteers experienced 6–8 contractions ofthe colon each day, compared with up to 25 contractions aday for volunteers suffering from IBS with diarrhea, andan almost complete absence of contractions among con-stipated IBS volunteers. In addition to differences in thenumber of contractions, many of the IBS volunteers expe-rienced powerful spasmodic contractions affecting a larg-er-than-normal area of the colon—”like having a Charliehorse in the gut,” according to one of the investigators.\nDIET. Some kinds of food and drink appear to play a\nkey role in triggering IBS attacks. Food and drink thathealthy people can ingest without any trouble may dis-rupt peristalsis in IBS patients, which probably explainswhy IBS attacks often occur shortly after meals. Choco-late, milk products, caffeine (in coffee, tea, colas, and\nother drinks), and large quantities of alcohol are some ofthe chief culprits. Other kinds of food have also been\nidentified as problems, however, and the pattern of whatcan and cannot be tolerated is different for each person.Characteristically, IBS symptoms rarely occur at nightand disrupt the patient’s sleep.\nSTRESS. Stress is an important factor in IBS because\nof the close nervous system connections between thebrain and the intestines. Although researchers do not yetunderstand all of the links between changes in the ner-vous system and IBS, they point out the similaritiesbetween mild digestive upsets and IBS. Just as healthypeople can feel nauseated or have an upset stomach whenunder stress, people with IBS react the same way, but to agreater degree. Finally, IBS symptoms sometimes inten-sify during menstruation, which suggests that femalereproductive hormones are another trigger.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosing IBS is a fairly complex task because the\ndisorder does not produce changes that can be identifiedduring a physical examination or by laboratory tests.\nWhen IBS is suspected, the doctor (who can be either afamily doctor or a specialist) needs to determine whetherthe patient’s symptoms satisfy the Rome criteria. Thedoctor must rule out other conditions that resemble IBS,such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis . These\ndisorders are ruled out by questioning the patient abouthis or her physical and mental health (the medical histo-ry), performing a physical examination, and orderinglaboratory tests. Normally the patient is asked to providea stool sample that can be tested for blood and intestinalparasites. In some cases x rays or an internal examinationof the colon using a flexible instrument inserted throughthe anus (a sigmoidoscope or colonoscope) is necessary.The doctor also may ask the patient to try a lactose-freediet for two or three weeks to see whether lactose intol-\nerance is causing the symptoms.\nTreatment\nDietary changes, sometimes supplemented by drugs\nor psychotherapy, are considered the key to successfultreatment. The following approach, offered by Daltonand Drossman, is typical of the advice found in the med-ical literature on IBS. The authors tie their approach tothe severity of the patient’s symptoms:\nMild symptoms\nDalton and Drossman recommend a low-fat, high-\nfiber diet. Problem-causing substances such as lactose,caffeine, beans, cabbage, cucumbers, broccoli, fattyfoods, alcohol, and medications should be identified andavoided. Bran or 15–25 grams a day of an over-the-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1866Irritable bowel syndromecounter psyllium laxative (Metamucil or Fiberall) may\nalso help both constipation and diarrhea. The patient canstill have milk or milk products if lactose intolerance isnot a problem. People with irregular bowel habits—par-ticularly constipated patients—may be helped by estab-lishing set times for meals and bathroom visits.\nModerate symptoms\nThe advice given by Dalton and Drossman in mild\ncases applies here as well. They also suggest that patientskeep a diary of symptoms for two or three weeks, cover-ing daily activities including meals, and emotionalresponses to events. The doctor can then review the diarywith the patient to identify possible problem areas.\nAlthough a high-fiber diet remains the standard\ntreatment for constipated patients, such laxatives as lac-\ntulose (Chronulac) or sorbitol may be prescribed. Lop-eramide (Imodium) and cholestyramine (Questran) aresuggested for diarrhea.

    "title": "Ischemia",
    "content": "Ischemia\nDefinition\nIschemia is an insufficient supply of blood to an\norgan, usually due to a blocked artery.\nDescription\nMyocardial ischemia is an intermediate condition in\ncoronary artery disease during which the heart tissue is\nslowly or suddenly starved of oxygen and other nutrients.Eventually, the affected heart tissue will die. When bloodflow is completely blocked to the heart, ischemia canlead to a heart attack . Ischemia can be silent or sympto-\nmatic. According to the American Heart Association, upto four million Americans may have silent ischemia andbe at high risk of having a heart attack with no warning.\nSymptomatic ischemia is characterized by chest\npain called angina pectoris. The American Heart Asso-\nciation estimates that nearly seven million Americanshave angina pectoris, usually called angina. Anginaoccurs more frequently in women than in men, and inblacks and Hispanics more than in whites. It also occursmore frequently as people age—25% of women overthe age of 85 and 27% of men who are 80–84 years oldhave angina.People with angina are at risk of having a heart\nattack. Stable angina occurs during exertion, can bequickly relieved by resting or taking nitroglycerin, andlasts from three to twenty minutes. Unstable angina,which increases the risk of a heart attack, occurs morefrequently, lasts longer, is more severe, and may causediscomfort during rest or light exertion.\nIschemia can also occur in the arteries of the brain,\nwhere blockages can lead to a stroke . About 80-85% of\nall strokes are ischemic. Most blockages in the cerebralarteries are due to a blood clot, often in an artery nar-rowed by plaque. Sometimes, a blood clot in the heart oraorta travels to a cerebral artery. A transient ischemic\nattack (TIA) is a “mini-stroke” caused by a temporary\ndeficiency of blood supply to the brain. It occurs sudden-ly, lasts a few minutes to a few hours, and is a strongwarning sign of an impending stroke. Ischemia can alsoeffect intestines, legs, feet and kidneys. Pain, malfunc-tions, and damage in those areas may result.\nCauses and symptoms\nIschemia is almost always caused by blockage of an\nartery, usually due to atherosclerotic plaque. Myocardialischemia is also caused by blood clots (which tend toform on plaque), artery spasms or contractions, or any ofthese factors combined. Silent ischemia is usually causedby emotional or mental stress or by exertion, but there\nare no symptoms. Angina is usually caused by increasedoxygen demand when the heart is working harder thanusual, for example, during exercise , or during mental or\nphysical stress. According to researchers at Harvard Uni-versity, physical stress is harder on the heart than mentalstress. A TIA is caused by a blood clot briefly blocking acerebral artery.\nRisk factors\nThe risk factors for myocardial ischemia are the\nsame as those for coronary artery disease. For TIA, coro-nary artery disease is also a risk factor.\n• Heredity. People whose parents have coronary artery\ndisease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri-cans are also at higher risk.\n• Sex. Men are more likely to have heart attacks than\nwomen, and to have them at a younger age.\n• Age. Men who are 45 years of age and older and\nwomen who are 55 years of age and older are consid-ered to be at risk.\n•Smoking . Smoking increases both the chance of devel-\noping coronary artery disease and the chance of dyingfrom it. Second hand smoke may also increase risk.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1868Ischemia•High cholesterol . Risk of developing coronary artery\ndisease increases as blood cholesterol levels increase.When combined with other factors, the risk is evengreater.\n• High blood pressure. High blood pressure makes the\nheart work harder, and with time, weakens it. Whencombined with obesity , smoking, high cholesterol, or\ndiabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases sev-eral times.\n• Lack of physical activity. Lack of exercise increases the\nrisk of coronary artery disease.\n• Diabetes mellitus. The risk of developing coronary\nartery disease is seriously increased for diabetics.\n• Obesity. Excess weight increases the strain on the heart\nand increases the risk of developing coronary arterydisease, even if no other risk factors are present. Obesi-ty increases blood pressure and blood cholesterol, andcan lead to diabetes.\n• Stress and anger. Some scientists believe that stress and\nanger can contribute to the development of coronaryartery disease. Stress increases the heart rate and bloodpressure and can injure the lining of the arteries. Angi-na attacks often occur after epsiodes of anger, as domany heart attacks and strokes.\nAngina symptoms include:\n• a tight, squeezing, heavy, burning, or choking pain that\nis usually beneath the breastbone—the pain may spreadto the throat, jaw, or one arm\n• a feeling of heaviness or tightness that isn’t painful\n• a feeling similar to gas or indigestion\n• attacks brought on by exertion and relieved by rest\nIf the pain or discomfort continues or intensifies,\nimmediate medical help should be sought, ideally within30 minutes.\nTIA symptoms include:\n• sudden weakness, tingling, or numbness, usually in one\narm or leg or both the arm and leg on the same side ofthe body, as well as sometimes in the face\n• audden loss of coordination• loss of vision or double vision\n• difficulty speaking\n• vertigo and loss of balance\nDiagnosis\nDiagnostic tests for myocardial ischemia include:\nresting, exercise, or ambulatory electrocardiograms;scintigraphic studies (radioactive heart scans); echocar-diography ; coronary angiography ; and, rarely, positron\nemission tomography . Diagnostic tests for TIA include\nphysician review of symptoms, computed tomography\nscans (CT scans), carotid artery ultrasound ( Doppler\nultrasonography ), and magnetic resonance imaging .\nAngiography is the best test for ischemia of any organ.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s activi-\nty and may reveal a lack of oxygen. Electrodes coveredwith conducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest,arms, and legs. Impulses of the heart’s activity are record-ed on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes and is per-formed in a physician’s office. About 25% of patients withangina have normal electrocardiograms. Another type ofelectrocardiogram, the exercise stress test , measures\nresponse to exertion when the patient is exercising on atreadmill or a stationary bike. It is performed in a physi-cian’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15 to 30minutes. This test is more accurate than a resting ECG indiagnosing ischemia. Sometimes an ambulatory ECG isordered. For this test, the patient wears a portable ECGmachine called a Holter monitor for 12, 24, or 48 hours.\nMyocardial perfusion scintigraphy and radionuclide\nangiography are nuclear studies involving the injection ofa radioactive material (e.g., thallium) that is absorbed byhealthy tissue. A gamma scintillation camera displays andrecords a series of images of the radioactive material’smovement through the heart. Both tests are usually per-formed in a hospital’s nuclear medicine department andtake about 30 minutes to an hour. A perfusion scan issometimes performed at the end of a stress test.\nAn echocardiogram uses sound waves to create an\nimage of the heart’s chambers and valves. The technicianapplies gel to a hand-held transducer, then presses itagainst the patient’s chest. The heart’s sound waves areconverted into an image on a monitor. Performed in acardiology outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes30 minutes to an hour. It can reveal abnormalities in theheart wall that indicate ischemia, but it doesn’t evaluatethe coronary arteries directly.\nCoronary angiography is the most accurate diagnos-\ntic technique, but it is also the most invasive. It shows theheart’s chambers, great vessels, and coronary arteries byusing a contrast solution and x ray technology. A movingpicture is recorded of the blood flow through the coronaryarteries. The patient is awake but sedated, and connectedto ECG electrodes and an intravenous line. A local anes-thetic is injected. The cardiologist then inserts a catheterinto a blood vessel and guides it into the heart. Coronaryangiography is performed in a cardiac catheterization\nlaboratory and takes from half an hour to two hours.\nPositron emission tomography ( PET ) is a noninva-\nsive nuclear test used to evaluate the heart tissue. A PET\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1869Ischemiascanner traces high-energy gamma rays released from\nradioactive particles to provide three-dimensional imagesof the heart tissue. Performed at a hospital, it usuallytakes from one hour to one hour and 45 minutes. PET isvery expensive and not widely available.\nComputed tomography scans (CT scans) and mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are computerized scan-ning methods. CT scanning uses a thin x-ray beam toshow three-dimensional views of soft tissues. It is per-formed at a hospital or clinic and takes less than aminute. MRI uses a magnetic field to produce clear,cross-sectional images of soft tissues. The patient lies ona table that slides into a tunnel-like scanner. It is usuallyperformed at a hospital and takes about 30 minutes.\nTreatment\nAngina is treated with drug therapy and surgery. Drugs\nsuch as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel\nblockers relieve chest pain, but they cannot clear blocked\narteries. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots. Surgical proce-\ndures include percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-\nplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery .\nNitroglycerin is the classic treatment for angina. It\nquickly relieves pain and discomfort by opening the coro-nary arteries and allowing more blood to flow to the heart.Beta blockers reduce the amount of oxygen required by\nthe heart during stress. Calcium channel blockers helpkeep the arteries open and reduce blood pressure. Aspirinhelps prevent blood clots from forming on plaques.\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery are invasive proce-dures that improve blood flow in the coronary arteries.Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is a non-surgical procedure in which a catheter tipped with a bal-\nloon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh into theblocked artery. The balloon is inflated, compressing theplaque to enlarge the blood vessel and open the blockedartery. The balloon is deflated and the catheter isremoved. The procedure is performed by a cardiologistin a hospital and generally requires a two-day stay.Sometimes a metal stent is placed in the artery to preventclosing of the artery.\nIn coronary artery bypass graft, called bypass\nsurgery, a detour is built around the coronary arteryblockage with a healthy leg vein or chest wall artery. Thehealthy vein or artery then supplies oxygen-rich blood tothe heart. Bypass surgery is major surgery appropriatefor patients with blockages in two or three major coro-nary arteries or severely narrowed left main coronaryarteries, as well as those who have not responded to othertreatments. It is performed in a hospital under generalanesthesia using a heart-lung machine to support thepatient while the healthy vein or artery is attached to thecoronary artery.\nThere are several experimental surgical procedures:\natherectomy , in which the surgeon shaves off and\nremoves strips of plaque from the blocked artery; laserangioplasty, in which a catheter with a laser tip is insert-ed to burn or break down the plaque; and insertion of ametal coil, called a stent, that can be implanted perma-nently to keep a blocked artery open. This stenting proce-dure is becoming more common. Another experimentalprocedure uses a laser to drill channels in the heart mus-cle to increase blood supply.\nTIAs are treated by drugs that control high blood\npressure and reduce the likelihood of blood clots andsurgery. Aspirin is commonly used and anticoagulantsare sometimes used to prevent blood clots. In somecases, carotid endarterectomy surgery is performed to\nhelp prevent further TIAs. The procedure involvesremoving arterial plaque from inside blood vessels.\nThe use of chelation therapy , a long-term injection\nby a physician of a cocktail of synthetic amino acid, eth-ylenediaminetetracetric acid, and anticoagulant drugsand nutrients, is controversial.\nAlternative treatment\nIschemia can be life-threatening. Although there are\nalternative treatments for angina, traditional medical caremay be necessary. Prevention of the cause of ischemia,primarily atherosclerosis , is primary. This becomes even\nmore important for people with a family history of heartdisease. Dietary modifications, especially the reductionor elimination of saturated fats (primarily found in meat),are essential. Increased fiber (found in fresh fruits and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1870Ischemia\nThis patient’s foot is affected with ischemia. Ischemia\noccurs when there is an insufficient supply of blood to aspecific organ or tissue. (Photograph by Dr. P . Marazzi, Photo\nResearchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)vegetables, grains, and beans) can help the body elimi-\nnate excessive cholesterol through the stools. Exercise,particularly aerobic exercise, is essential for circulationhealth. Not smoking will prevent damage from smokeand the harmful substances it contains.\nAbana, a mixture of herbs and minerals used in\nayurvedic medicine , can reduce the frequency and severi-\nty of angina attacks. Western herbal medicine recom-mends hawthorn ( Crataegus laevigata or C. oxyacantha )\nto relieve long-term angina, since it strengthens the con-tractility of the heart muscles. Nutritional supplements andbotanical medicines that act as antioxidants, for example,vitamins C and E, selenium, gingko ( Gingko biloba ), bil-\nberry ( Vaccinium myrtillus ), and hawthorn, can help pre-\nvent initial arterial injury that can lead to the formation ofplaque deposits. Cactus ( Cactus grandiflorus ) is a homeo-\npathic remedy used for pain relief during an attack.Mind/body relaxation techniques such as yoga and\nbiofeedback can help control strong emotions and stress.\nPrognosis\nIn many cases, ischemia can be successfully treated,\nbut the underlying disease process of atherosclerosis isusually not “cured.” New diagnostic techniques enabledoctors to identify ischemia earlier. New technologiesand surgical procedures can prevent angina from leadingto a heart attack or TIA from resulting in a stroke. Theoutcome for patients with silent ischemia has not beenwell established.\nPrevention\nA healthy lifestyle, including eating right, getting\nregular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, not smok-ing, drinking in moderation, not using illegal drugs, con-trolling hypertension , and managing stress are practices\nthat can reduce the risk of ischemia progressing to a heartattack or stroke.\nA healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are\nlow in fat, especially saturated fat; low in cholesterol;and high in fiber. Plenty of fruits and vegetables shouldbe eaten and sodium should be limited. Fat should com-prise no more than 30% of total daily calories. Choles-terol should be limited to about 300 mg and sodium toabout 2,400 mg per day.\nModerate aerobic exercise lasting about 30 minutes\nfour or more times per week is recommended for maxi-mum heart health, according to the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention and the American College ofSports Medicine. Three 10-minute exercise periods arealso beneficial. If any risk factors are present, a physician’sclearance should be obtained before starting exercise.KEY TERMS\nAtherosclerosis —A process in which the walls of\nthe arteries thicken due to the accumulation ofplaque in the blood vessels. Atherosclerosis is thecause of most coronary artery disease.\nCoronary artery disease —A narrowing or block-\nage, due to atherosclerosis, of the arteries that pro-vide oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Whenblood flow is cut-off, the result is a heart attack.\nPlaque —A deposit of fatty and other substances\nthat accumulate in the lining of the artery wall.\nStroke —A sudden decrease or loss of conscious-\nness caused by rupture or blockage of a blood ves-sel by a blood clot or hemorrhage in the brain.Ischemic strokes are caused by blood clots in acerebral artery.\nMaintaining a desirable body weight is also impor-\ntant. People who are 20% or more over their ideal bodyweight have an increased risk of developing coronaryartery disease or stroke.\nSmoking has many adverse effects on the heart and\narteries, so should be avoided. Heart damage caused bysmoking can be improved by quitting. Several studies haveshown that ex-smokers face the same risk of heart diseaseas non-smokers within five to ten years of quitting.\nExcessive drinking can increase risk factors for heart\ndisease. Modest consumption of alcohol, however, canactually protect against coronary artery disease. The Amer-ican Heart Association defines moderate consumption asone ounce of alcohol per day—roughly one cocktail, one 8-ounce glass of wine, or two 12-ounce glasses of beer.\nCommonly used illegal drugs can seriously harm the\nheart and should never be used. Even stimulants likeephedra and decongestants like pseudoephedrine can be\nharmful to patients with hypertension or heart disease.\nTreatment should be sought for hypertension. High\nblood pressure can be completely controlled throughlifestyle changes and medication. Stress, which canincrease the risk of a heart attack or stroke, should alsobe managed. While it cannot always be avoided, it can becontrolled.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Heart Association. Heart Attack Treatment, Preven-\ntion, Recovery.

    "title": "Isolation",
    "content": "Isolation\nDefinition\nIsolation refers to the precautions that are taken in the\nhospital to prevent the spread of an infectious agent froman infected or colonized patient to susceptible persons.\nPurpose\nIsolation practices are designed to minimize the\ntransmission of infection in the hospital, using currentunderstanding of the way infections can transmit. Isola-tion should be done in a user-friendly, well-accepted,inexpensive way that interferes as little as possible withpatient care; minimizes patient discomfort; and avoidsunnecessary use.Precautions\nThe types of precautions used should be viewed as a\nflexible scale that may range from the least to the mostdemanding methods of prevention. These methodsshould always take into account that differences exist inthe way that diseases are spread. Recognition and under-standing of these differences will avoid use of insuffi-cient or unnecessary interventions.\nDescription\nIsolation practices can include placement in a private\nroom or with a select roommate; the use of protective bar-riers such as masks, gowns and gloves; a special emphasison handwashing (which is always very important); andspecial handling of contaminated articles. Because of thedifferences among infectious diseases, more than one ofthese precautions may be necessary to prevent spread ofsome diseases but may not be necessary for others.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) and the Hospital Infection Control Practice\nAdvisory Committee (HICPAC) have led the way indefining the guidelines for hospital-based infection pre-cautions. The most current system recommended for usein hospitals consists of two levels of precautions. Thefirst level is Standard Precautions, which apply to allpatients at all times because signs and symptoms ofinfection are not always obvious and therefore mayunknowingly pose a risk for a susceptible person. Thesecond level is known as Transmission-Based Precau-tions, which are intended for individuals who have aknown or suspected infection with certain organisms.\nFrequently, patients are admitted to the hospital with-\nout a definite diagnosis, but with clues that suggest aninfection. These patients should be isolated with theappropriate precautions until a definite diagnosis is made.\nStandard Precautions\nStandard Precautions define all the steps that should\nbe taken to prevent spread of infection from person toperson when there is an anticipated contact with:\n• blood\n• body fluids\n• secretions, such as phlegm\n• excretions, such as urine and feces (not including\nsweat), whether or not they contain visible blood\n• nonintact skin, such as an open wound\n• mucous membranes, such as the mouth cavity\nStandard Precautions includes the use of one or of\ncombinations of the following practices. The level of use\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1872Isolationwill always depend on the nature of the anticipated con-\ntact with the patient:\n• handwashing, the most important infection control\nmethod\n• use of latex or other protective gloves\n• masks, eye protection and/or face shield\n• gowns\n• proper handling of soiled patient care equipment• proper environmental cleaning\n• minimal handling of soiled linen\n• proper disposal of needles and other sharp equipment\nsuch as scalpels\n• placement in a private room for patients who cannot\nmaintain appropriate cleanliness or contain body fluids\nTransmission-Based Precautions\nTransmission-Based Precautions may be needed in\naddition to Standard Precautions for selected patientswho are known or suspected to harbor certain infections.These precautions are divided into three categories thatreflect the differences in the way infections are transmit-ted. Some diseases may require more than one isolationcategory.\nAIRBORNE PRECAUTIONS. Airborne Precautions pre-\nvent diseases that are transmitted by minute particlescalled droplet nuclei or contaminated dust particles.These particles, can remain suspended in the air for longperiods of time because of their size; even after the infect-ed person has left the room. Some examples of diseasesrequiring these precautions are tuberculosis ,measles ,\nand chickenpox .\nA patient needing Airborne Precautions should be\nassigned to a private room with special ventilationrequirements. The door to this room must be closed at allpossible times. If a patient must move from the isolationroom to another area of the hospital, the patient shouldbe wearing a mask during the transport. Anyone enteringthe isolation room to provide care to the patient mustwear a special mask called a respirator.\nDROPLET PRECAUTIONS. Droplet Precautions pre-\nvent the spread of organisms that travel on particlesmuch larger than the droplet nuclei. These particles donot spend much time suspended in the air, and usually donot travel beyond a several-foot range from the patient.These particles are produced when a patient coughs,talks, or sneezes. Examples of diseases requiring dropletprecautions are meningococcal meningitis (a serious\nbacterial infection of the lining of the brain), influenza ,\nmumps , and German measles ( rubella ).KEY TERMS\nColonized —Colonization occurs when a microor-\nganism is found on or in a person without causinga disease.\nDisinfected —Decreased the number of microor-\nganisms on or in an object.\nLatex —A rubber material from which gloves and\ncondoms are made.\nPhlegm —Another word for sputum, material\ncoughed up from a person’s airway.\nStethoscope —A medical instrument for listening\nto a patient’s heart and lungs.\nPatients who require Droplet Precautions should be\nplaced in a private room or with a roommate who is infect-ed with the same organism. The door to the room mayremain open. Health care workers will need to wear maskswithin 3 ft of the patient. Patients moving about the hospi-tal away from the isolation room should wear a mask.\nCONTACT PRECAUTIONS. Contact Precautions pre-\nvent spread of organisms from an infected patientthrough direct (touching the patient) or indirect (touchingsurfaces or objects that that been in contact with thepatient) contact. Examples of patients who might beplaced in Contact Precautions are those infected with:\n• antibiotic-resistant bacteria• hepatitis A• scabies• impetigo• lice\nThis type of precaution requires the patient to be\nplaced in a private room or with a roommate who has thesame infection. Health care workers should wear gloveswhen entering the room. They should change theirgloves if they touch material such as soiled dressingsthat contains large volumes of organisms. Prior to leav-ing the room, health care workers should remove thegloves and wash their hands with medicated soap. Inaddition, they may need to wear protective gowns ifthere is a chance of contact with potentially infectivematerials such as discharges from diarrhea or wound\ndrainage that cannot be contained, or if there is likely tobe extensive contact with the patient or environment.\nPatient care items, such as a stethoscope, that are\nused for a patient in Contact Precautions should not beshared with other patients unless they are properly\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1873Isolationcleaned and disinfected before reuse.

    "title": "Itching",
    "content": "Itching\nDefinition\nItching is an intense, distracting irritation or tickling\nsensation that may be felt all over the skin’s surface, orconfined to just one area. The medical term for itching is“pruritus.”\nDescription\nItching instinctively leads most people to scratch the\naffected area. Different people can tolerate differentamounts of itching, and anyone’s threshold of tolerancecan be changed due to stress , emotions, and other fac-\ntors. In general, itching is more severe if the skin iswarm, and if there are few distractions. This is why peo-ple tend to notice itching more at night.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe reason for the sensation of itching is not well\nunderstood. While itching is the most noticeable symp-tom in many skin diseases, it doesn’t necessary mean thata person who feels itchy has a disease.Stress and emotional upset can make itching worse,\nno matter what the underlying cause. If emotional prob-lems are the primary reason for the itch, the condition isknown as psychogenic itching. Some people become con-vinced that their itch is caused by a parasite; this convic-tion is often linked to burning sensations in the tongue,and may be caused by a major psychiatric disorder.\nGeneralized itching\nItching that occurs all over the body may indicate a\nmedical condition such as diabetes mellitus , liver dis-\nease, kidney failure, jaundice , thyroid disorders (and\nrarely, cancer ). Blood disorders such as leukemia, and\nlymphatic conditions such as Hodgkin’s disease may\nsometimes cause itching as well.\nSome people may develop an itch without a rash\nwhen they take certain drugs (such as aspirin , codeine,\ncocaine ); others may develop an itchy red “drug rash” or\nhives because of an allergy to a specific drug.\nItching also may be caused when any of the family\nof hookworm larvae penetrate the skin. This includesswimmer’s itch and creeping eruption caused by cat ordog hookworm, and ground itch caused by the “true”hookworm.\nMany skin conditions cause an itchy rash. These\ninclude:\n• atopic dermatitis\n• chickenpox\n•contact dermatitis\n• dermatitis herpetiformis (occasionally)\n• eczema\n• fungus infections (such as athlete’s foot )\n• hives (urticaria)\n• insect bites\n• lice\n• lichen planus\n• neurodermatitis ( lichen simplex chronicus )\n• psoriasis (occasionally)\n• scabies\nOn the other hand, itching all over the body can be\ncaused by something as simple as bathing too often,which removes the skin’s natural oils and may make theskin too dry and scaly.\nLocalized itching\nSpecific itchy areas may occur if a person comes in\ncontact with soap, detergents, and wool or other rough-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1874Itchingtextured, scratchy material. Adults who have hemor-\nrhoids , anal fissure, or persistent diarrhea may notice\nitching around the anus (called “pruritus ani”). In chil-dren, itching in this area is most likely due to worms.\nIntense itching in the external genitalia in women\n(“pruritus vulvae”) may be due to candidiasis , hormonal\nchanges, or the use of certain spermicides or vaginal sup-positories, ointments, or deodorants.\nIt’s also common for older people to suffer from dry,\nitchy skin (especially on the back) for no obvious reason.Younger people also may notice dry, itchy skin in coldweather. Itching is also a common complaint duringpregnancy .\nDiagnosis\nItching is a symptom that is quite obvious to its vic-\ntim. Someone who itches all over should seek medicalcare. Because itching can be caused by such a wide vari-ety of triggers, a complete physical exam and medicalhistory will help diagnose the underlying problem. Avariety of blood and stool tests may help determine theunderlying cause.\nTreatment\nAntihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl)\ncan help relieve itching caused by hives, but won’t affectitching from other causes. Most antihistamines also makepeople sleepy, which can help patients sleep who wouldotherwise be awake from the itch.\nSpecific treatment of itching depends on the under-\nlying condition that causes it. In general, itchy skinshould be treated very gently. While scratching may tem-porarily ease the itch, in the long run scratching justmakes it worse. In addition, scratching can lead to anendless cycle of itch—scratch—more itching.\nTo avoid the urge to scratch, a person can apply a\ncooling or soothing lotion or cold compress when theurge to scratch occurs. Soaps are often irritating to theskin, and can make an itch worse; they should be avoid-ed, or used only when necessary.\nCreams or ointments containing cortisone may help\ncontrol the itch from insect bites, contact dermatitis oreczema. Cortisone cream should not be applied to theface unless a doctor prescribes it.\nProbably the most common cause of itching is dry\nskin. There are a number of simple things a person cando to ease the annoying itch:\n• don’t wear tight clothes\n• avoid synthetic fabricsKEY TERMS\nAtopic dermatitis —An intensely itchy inflamma-\ntion often found on the face of people prone toallergies.

    "title": "IUD",
    "content": "IUD\nDefinition\nAn IUD is an intrauterine device made of plastic\nand/or copper that is inserted into the womb (uterus) byway of the vaginal canal. One type releases a hormone(progesterone), and is replaced each year. The secondtype is made of copper and can be left in place for fiveyears. The most common shape in current use is a plastic“T” which is wrapped with copper wire.\nPurpose\nIUDs are used to prevent pregnancy and are consid-\nered to be 95–98% effective. It should be noted thatIUDs offer no protection against the acquired immunod-\neficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) virus or other sexually\ntransmitted diseases (STDs).\nPrecautions\nIUDs are placed in the uterus by physicians. Prior to\nplacement the doctor will take a medical history, do aphysical examination , and take a Pap test . Women who\nhave had tubal pregnancies, an abnormal Pap smear, orabnormal vaginal bleeding are generally disqualifiedfrom using this form of contraception . Also, women\nwho have STDs, an allergy to copper, severe pain with\nperiods (menstruation), sex with multiple partners, orwho are currently pregnant are not eligible for an IUD.There are no age restrictions.\nDescription\nThere is continuing controversy over exactly how\nIUDs prevent pregnancy. Some researchers think preg-nancy is controlled by preventing conception (fertiliza-tion), while others believe that the devices preventembryo attachment to the uterine wall (implantation).\nIUDs that release a hormone may prevent pregnancy\nin several ways. Since one hormonal response is a thick-ening of the mucus at the entrance to the uterus, it ismore difficult for the sperm to gain entry. This preventsthe sperm from reaching an ovum. At the same time, thelining of the uterus becomes thinner, making it more dif-ficult for a fertilized egg to implant itself in the uterus.The copper device slowly releases copper, which isbelieved to weaken and perhaps kill sperm. An alternateexplanation is that these objects “sweep” the uterus, dis-lodging any fertilized egg that attempts to implant itself.In addition, both devices tend to cause a mild inflamma-tory reaction in the lining of the uterus, which also has anadverse impact on implantation.\nPreparation\nAfter the physician approves the use of an IUD, the\nwoman’s genital area is washed thoroughly with soapand water in preparation of IUD insertion. The openinginto the uterus (cervix) will also be cleaned with an anti-septic such as an iodine solution. Actual IUD insertiontakes about five minutes, during which local anesthesia isused to reduce any discomfort associated with the proce-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1876IUDdure. A plastic string connected to the IUD will hang out\nof the uterus into the vagina. The string is used to period-ically check the position of the IUD.\nAftercare\nThe woman will be taught to watch for the signs and\nsymptoms of potential complications and how to checkthe string, which should be done at least once a week. Tocheck the string, the woman should first wash her handswith soap and water. From a squatting position, or withone foot elevated (such as on a chair), she should gentlyinsert her finger into the vagina until she feels the cervix.If she cannot feel the string, if the string feels longer thanit should, or if she can feel part of the IUD she shouldnotify her physician immediately. Additional informationthat needs to be reported includes painful intercourse andunusual discharges from the vagina.KEY TERMS\nAntiseptic —An antiseptic is a chemical that pre-\nvents the growth of germs.\nHormone —Hormones are chemicals that are pro-\nduced in an organ or gland and then are carriedby the blood to another part of the body wherethey produce a special effect for which they weredesigned.\nPap test —This is a procedure by which cells are\ncollected from the cervix and vagina by inserting aswab into the vaginal canal.

The virus is transmitted to humans bymosquitoes.\nDescription\nThe virus that causes Japanese encephalitis is called\nan arbovirus, which is an arthropod-borne virus. Mosqui-toes are a type of arthropod. Mosquitoes in a number ofregions carry this virus and are responsible for passing italong to humans. Many of these areas are in Asia, includ-ing Japan, Korea, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia,Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Areaswhere the disease-causing arbovirus is always present arereferred to as being endemic for the disease. In such areas,blood tests will reveal that more than 70% of all adultshave been infected at some point with the arbovirus.\nBecause the virus that causes Japanese encephalitis\nis carried by mosquitoes, the number of people infectedincreases during those seasons when mosquitoes areabundant. This tends to be in the warmest, rainiestmonths. In addition to humans, other animals like wildbirds, pigs, and horses are susceptible to infection withthis arbovirus. Because the specific type of mosquito car-rying the Japanese encephalitis arbovirus frequentlybreeds in rice paddies, the disease is considered to be pri-marily a rural problem.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe virus is transferred to a human when an infect-\ned mosquito sucks that person’s blood. Once in thebody, the virus travels to various glands where it multi-plies. The virus can then enter the bloodstream. Ulti-mately, the virus settles in the brain, where it causesserious problems.Japanese encephalitis begins with fever ,s e v e r e\nheadache , nausea, and vomiting. As the tissue covering\nthe brain and spinal cord (the meninges) becomes infect-ed and swollen, the patient will develop a stiff andpainful neck. By day two or three, the patient begins tosuffer the effects of swelling in the brain. These effectsinclude:\n• problems with balance and coordination• paralysis of some muscle groups• tremors• seizures• lapses in consciousness• a stiff, mask-like appearance of the face\nThe patient becomes dehydrated and loses weight. If\nthe patient survives the illness, the fever will decrease byabout day seven and the symptoms will begin to improveby about day 14. Other patients will continue to haveextremely high fevers and their symptoms will get worse.In these cases, coma and then death occur in 7-14 days.\nMany patients who recover have permanent disabilitiesdue to brain damage.\nDiagnosis\nMost diagnostic techniques for Japanese encephali-\ntis do not yield results very quickly. The diagnosis ismade primarily on the basis of the patient’s symptomsand the knowledge of the kinds of illnesses endemic to aparticular geographic region.\nImmunofluorescence tests, where special viral\nmarkers react with human antibodies that have beentagged with a fluorescent chemical, are used to verify thedisease. However, these results tend to be unavailableuntil week two of the infection. Other tests involve com-paring the presence and quantity of particular antibodiesin the blood or spinal fluid during week one with thosepresent during week two of the illness.J\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1879Treatment\nThere are no treatments available to stop or slow the\nprogression of Japanese encephalitis. Only the symptomsof each patient can be treated. Fluids are given todecrease dehydration and medications are given to\ndecrease fever and pain . Medications are available to\nattempt to decrease brain swelling. Patients in a comamay require mechanical assistance with breathing.\nPrognosis\nWhile the majority of people infected with arbovirus\nnever become sick, those who develop Japaneseencephalitis become very ill. Some outbreaks have a50% death rate. A variety of long-term problems mayhaunt those who recover from the illness. These prob-lems include:\n• movement difficulties where the arms, legs, or body\njerks or writhes involuntarily\n• shaking\n• paralysis\n• inability to control emotions\n• loss of mental abilities\n• mental disturbances, including schizophrenia (which\nmay affect as many as 75% of Japanese encephalitissurvivors)\nYoung children are most likely to have serious, long-\nterm problems after an infection.\nPrevention\nA three-dose vaccine is available for Japanese\nencephalitis and is commonly given to young children inareas where the disease is endemic. Travelers to theseregions can also receive the vaccine.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —A type of cell made by the immune\nsystem that has the ability to recognize markers(antigens) on the surface of invading organisms,like bacteria and viruses.\nEncephalitis —A swelling of the brain, potentially\ncausing serious brain damage.\nEndemic —Naturally and consistently present in a\ncertain geographical region.Controlling the mosquito population with insecti-\ncides is another preventive measure.

    "title": "Jaundice",
    "content": "Jaundice\nDefinition\nJaundice is a condition in which a person’s skin and\nthe whites of the eyes are discolored yellow due to anincreased level of bile pigments in the blood resultingfrom liver disease. Jaundice is sometimes called icterus,from a Greek word for the condition.\nDescription\nIn order to understand jaundice, it is useful to know\nabout the role of the liver in producing bile. The mostimportant function of the liver is the processing of chem-ical waste products like cholesterol and excreting theminto the intestines as bile. The liver is the premier chemi-cal factory in the body—most incoming and outgoingchemicals pass through it. It is the first stop for all nutri-ents, toxins, and drugs absorbed by the digestive tract.The liver also collects chemicals from the blood for pro-cessing. Many of these outward-bound chemicals areexcreted into the bile. One particular substance, biliru-bin, is yellow. Bilirubin is a product of the breakdown ofhemoglobin, which is the protein inside red blood cells.If bilirubin cannot leave the body, it accumulates and dis-colors other tissues. The normal total level of bilirubin inblood serum is between 0.2 mg/dL and 1.2 mg/dL. Whenit rises to 3 mg/dL or higher, the person’s skin and thewhites of the eyes become noticeably yellow.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1880JaundiceBile is formed in the liver. It then passes into the net-\nwork of hepatic bile ducts, which join to form a singletube. A branch of this tube carries bile to the gallbladder,where it is stored, concentrated, and released on a signalfrom the stomach. Food entering the stomach is the sig-nal that stimulates the gallbladder to release the bile. Thetube, which is now called the common bile duct, contin-ues to the intestines. Before the common bile duct reach-es the intestines, it is joined by another duct from thepancreas. The bile and the pancreatic juice enter theintestine through a valve called the ampulla of Vater.After entering the intestine, the bile and pancreatic secre-tions together help in the process of digestion.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are many different causes for jaundice, but\nthey can be divided into three categories based on wherethey start—before, in, or after the liver (pre-hepatic,hepatic and post-hepatic). When bilirubin begins its lifecycle, it cannot be dissolved in water. The liver changesit so that it is soluble in water. These two types of biliru-bin are called unconjugated (insoluble) and conjugated(soluble). Blood tests can easily distinguish betweenthese two types of bilirubin.\nHemoglobin and bilirubin formation\nBilirubin begins as hemoglobin in the blood-forming\norgans, primarily the bone marrow. If the production ofred blood cells (RBCs) falls below normal, the extrahemoglobin finds its way into the bilirubin cycle andadds to the pool.\nOnce hemoglobin is in the red cells of the blood, it\ncirculates for the life span of those cells. The hemoglobinthat is released when the cells die is turned into bilirubin.If for any reason the RBCs die at a faster rate than usual,bilirubin can accumulate in the blood and cause jaundice.\nHemolytic disorders\nMany disorders speed up the death of red blood\ncells. The process of red blood cell destruction is calledhemolysis, and the diseases that cause it are calledhemolytic disorders. If red blood cells are destroyedfaster than they can be produced, the patient developsanemia. Hemolysis can occur in a number of diseases,disorders, conditions, and medical procedures:\n•Malaria . The malaria parasite develops inside red\nblood cells. When it is mature it breaks the cell apartand swims off in the blood. This process happens tomost of the parasites simultaneously, causing the inter-mittent symptoms of the disease. When enough cellsburst at once, jaundice may result from the largeamount of bilirubin formed from the hemoglobin in the\ndead cells. The pigment may reach the urine in suffi-cient quantities to cause “blackwater fever,” an oftenlethal form of malaria.\n• Side effects of certain drugs. Some common drugs can\ncause hemolysis as a rare but sudden side effect. Thesemedications include some antibiotic and anti-tuberculo-sis medicines; drugs that regulate the heartbeat; andlevodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease .\n• Certain drugs in combination with a hereditary enzyme\ndeficiency known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-nase (G6PD). G6PD is a deficiency that affects over200 million people in the world. Some of the drugs list-ed above are more likely to cause hemolysis in peoplewith G6PD. Other drugs cause hemolysis only in peo-ple with this disorder. Most important among thesedrugs are anti-malarial medications such as quinine,and vitamins C and K.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1881Jaundice\nThis patient suffers from obstructive jaundice, which is\noften caused by gallstones. (Custom Medical Stock Photo.\nReproduced by permission.)• Poisons. Snake and spider venom, certain bacterial tox-\nins, copper, and some organic industrial chemicalsdirectly attack the membranes of red blood cells.\n• Artificial heart valves. The inflexible moving parts of\nheart valves damage RBCs as they flutter back andforth. This damage is one reason to recommend pigvalves and valves made of other organic materials.\n• Hereditary RBC disorders. There are a number of\nhereditary defects that affect the blood cells. There aremany genetic mutations that affect the hemoglobinitself, the best-known of which is sickle cell disease .\nSuch hereditary disorders as spherocytosis weaken theouter membrane of the red cell. There are also inheriteddefects that involve the internal chemistry of RBCs.\n• Enlargement of the spleen. The spleen is an organ that\nis located near the upper end of the stomach and filtersthe blood. It is supposed to filter out and destroy onlyworn-out RBCs. If it has become enlarged, it filters outnormal cells as well. Malaria, other infections, cancers\nand leukemias, some of the hereditary anemias men-\ntioned above, obstruction of blood flow from thespleen—all these and many more diseases can enlargethe spleen to the point where it removes too many redblood cells.\n• Diseases of the small blood vessels. Hemolysis that\noccurs in diseased small blood vessels is called microan-giopathic hemolysis. It results from damage caused byrough surfaces on the inside of the capillaries. The RBCssqueeze through capillaries one at a time and can easilybe damaged by scraping against the vessel walls.\n• Immune reactions to RBCs. Several types of cancer\nand immune system diseases produce antibodies thatreact with RBCs and destroy them. In 75% of cases,this reaction occurs all by itself, with no underlying dis-ease to account for it.\n• Transfusions. If a patient is given an incompatible\nblood type, hemolysis results.\n• Kidney failure and other serious diseases. Several dis-\neases are characterized by defective blood coagulationthat can destroy red blood cells.\n•Erythroblastosis fetalis . Erythroblastosis fetalis is a\ndisease of newborns marked by the presence of toomany immature red blood cells (erythroblasts) in thebaby’s blood. When a baby’s mother has a differentblood type, antibodies from the mother may leak intothe baby’s circulation and destroy blood cells. Thisreaction can produce severe hemolysis and jaundice inthe newborn. Rh factor incompatibility is the mostcommon cause.\n• High bilirubin levels in newborns. Even in the absence\nof blood type incompatibility, the newborn’s bilirubinlevel may reach threatening levels.\nNormal jaundice in newborns\nNormal newborn jaundice is the result of two condi-\ntions occurring at the same time—a pre-hepatic and ahepatic source of excess bilirubin. First of all, the baby atbirth immediately begins converting hemoglobin from afetal type to an adult type. The fetal type of hemoglobinwas able to extract oxygen from the lower levels of oxy-gen in the mother’s blood. At birth the infant can extractoxygen directly from his or her own lungs and does notneed the fetal hemoglobin any more. So fetal hemoglo-bin is removed from the system and replaced with adulthemoglobin. The resulting bilirubin loads the system andplaces demands on the liver to clear it. But the liver is notquite ready for the task, so there is a period of a week orso when the liver has to catch up. During that time thebaby is jaundiced.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1882Jaundice\nA newborn baby undergoes phototherapy with visible blue\nlight to treat his jaundice. (Photograph by Ron Sutherland,\nPhoto Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)Hepatic jaundice\nLiver diseases of all kinds threaten the organ’s abili-\nty to keep up with bilirubin processing. Starvation , cir-\nculating infections, certain medications, hepatitis, andcirrhosis can all cause hepatic jaundice, as can certain\nhereditary defects of liver chemistry, including Gilbert’ssyndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome.\nPost-hepatic jaundice\nPost-hepatic forms of jaundice include the jaundices\ncaused by failure of soluble bilirubin to reach theintestines after it has left the liver. These disorders arecalled obstructive jaundices. The most common cause ofobstructive jaundice is the presence of gallstones in the\nducts of the biliary system. Other causes have to do withbirth defects and infections that damage the bile ducts;\ndrugs; infections; cancers; and physical injury. Somedrugs—and pregnancy on rare occasions—simply cause\nthe bile in the ducts to stop flowing.\nSymptoms and complications associated with\njaundice\nCertain chemicals in bile may cause itching when too\nmuch of them ends up in the skin. In newborns, insolublebilirubin may get into the brain and do permanent damage.Long-standing jaundice may upset the balance of chemi-cals in the bile and cause stones to form. Apart from thesepotential complications and the discoloration of skin andeyes, jaundice by itself is inoffensive. Other symptoms aredetermined by the disease producing the jaundice.\nDiagnosis\nPhysical examination\nIn many cases the diagnosis of jaundice is suggested\nby the appearance of the patient’s eyes and complexion.The doctor will ask the patient to lie flat on the examin-ing table in order to feel (palpate) the liver and spleen forenlargement and to evaluate any abdominal pain . The\nlocation and severity of abdominal pain and the presenceor absence of fever help the doctor to distinguish\nbetween hepatic and obstructive jaundice.\nLaboratory tests\nDisorders of blood formation can be diagnosed by\nmore thorough examination of the blood or the bonemarrow, where blood is made. Occasionally a bone mar-row biopsy is required, but usually the blood itself willreveal the diagnosis. The spleen can be evaluated by anultrasound examination or a nuclear scan if the physical\nexamination has not yielded enough information.Liver disease is usually assessed from blood studies\nalone, but again a biopsy may be necessary to clarify lessobvious conditions. A liver biopsy is performed at the\nbedside. The doctor uses a thin needle to take a tiny coreof tissue from the liver. The tissue sample is sent to thelaboratory for examination under a microscope.\nAssessment of jaundice in newborns\nNewborns are more likely to have problems with\njaundice if:\n• they are premature.\n• they are Asian or Native Americans.\n• they have been bruised during the birth process.\n• they have lost too much weight during the first few\ndays.\n• they are born at high altitude.\n• the mother has diabetes.\n• labor had to be induced\nImaging studies\nDisease in the biliary system can be identified by\nimaging techniques, of which there are many. X rays aretaken a day after swallowing a contrast agent that is secret-ed into the bile. This study gives functional as well asanatomical information. There are several ways of inject-ing x ray dye directly into the bile ducts. It can be donethrough a thin needle pushed straight into the liver orthrough a scope passed through the stomach that can injectdye into the Ampulla of Vater. CT and MRI scans are veryuseful for imaging certain conditions like cancers in andaround the liver or gall stones in the common bile duct.\nTreatment\nJaundice in newborns\nNewborns are the only major category of patients in\nwhom the jaundice itself requires attention. Because theinsoluble bilirubin can get into the brain, the amount inthe blood must not go over certain levels. If there is rea-son to suspect increased hemolysis in the newborn, thebilirubin level must be measured repeatedly during thefirst few days of life. If the level of bilirubin shortly afterbirth threatens to go too high, treatment must beginimmediately. Exchanging most of the baby’s blood wasthe only way to reduce the amount of bilirubin until afew decades ago. Then it was discovered that bright bluelight will render the bilirubin harmless. Now jaundicedbabies are fitted with eye protection and placed underbright fluorescent lights. The light chemically alters thebilirubin in the blood as it passes through the baby’s skin.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1883JaundiceHemolytic disorders\nHemolytic diseases are treated, if at all, with med-\nications and blood transfusions, except in the case of alarge spleen. Surgical removal of the spleen ( splenecto-\nmy) can sometimes cure hemolytic anemia . Drugs that\ncause hemolysis or arrest the flow of bile must bestopped immediately.\nHepatic jaundice\nMost liver diseases have no specific cure, but the liver\nis so robust that it can heal from severe damage and regen-erate itself from a small remnant of its original tissue.\nPost-hepatic jaundice\nObstructive jaundice frequently requires a surgical\ncure. If the original passageways cannot be restored, sur-geons have several ways to create alternate routes. Apopular technique is to sew an open piece of intestineover a bare patch of liver. Tiny bile ducts in that part ofthe liver will begin to discharge their bile into the intes-tine, and pressure from the obstructed ducts elsewherewill find release in that direction. As the flow increases,the ducts grow to accommodate it.

    "title": "Jaw wiring",
    "content": "Jaw wiring\nDefinition\nJaw wiring, also known as maxillomandibular fixa-\ntion, is a surgical procedure where metal pins and wiresare anchored into the jaw bones and surrounding tissuesto keep the jaw from moving.\nPurpose\nSports injuries , automobile accidents, falls, or fist-\nfights are a few of the situations where the jaw might befractured or broken. In these cases, jaw wiring may benecessary to keep the bones aligned and stable while thejaw heals. The presence of cancer or other diseased tis-\nsues may make removal and reconstruction of the jawnecessary. Wiring the jaws shut has been used in the pastas a weight loss aid in cases of extreme obesity where\nother treatments had failed, although this procedure israrely used for that purpose today.\nPrecautions\nTraumatic injuries to the face can cause damage to\nfacial nerves and salivary glands and ducts. Theseinjuries can also leave scars that may require additionalsurgery to correct.\nDescription\nJaw wiring surgery can be performed by an oral or\nmaxillofacial surgeon (a specially trained dentist), or byan otolaryngologist (a doctor specializing in surgeries ofthe head and neck). The procedure may be done in a med-ical or dental office if the office is staffed and equipped tohandle this type of surgery. More often, this surgery isperformed in a hospital or medical center surgical area. Ifjaw wiring is required due to an injury, the surgeon mayset the fracture immediately before swelling sets in. It isalso possible to wait (up to several weeks) until theswelling goes down and some of the soft tissue injurieshave healed, prior to wiring the jaw fracture.\nThe surgeon realigns the fractured bones. Every\neffort is made to restore the shape and appearance of theoriginal jaw line. If any teeth were damaged, repair orreplacement may be done at the same time. Small inci-sions may be made through the skin and surrounding tis-sue so the pins and wires can be set into the jawbone tohold the fracture together. To prevent the lower jaw frommoving during healing, pins and wires may be insertedinto the top jaw, as well. The upper and lower jaws arethen wired together in order to stabilize the fracture.\nAs with other types of bone fractures , the jaw may\ntake several weeks to heal. Another type of jaw immobi-\nlization that has been developed more recently, rigid fix-\nation uses small metal plates and screws rather than pinsand wires to secure the jaw bones. The main benefit ofthis technique is that the jaws do not have to be wiredshut, allowing the patient to return to a more normallifestyle sooner.\nPreparation\nX rays of the fractured area may be taken prior to\nsurgery. Depending on the extent of the facial injury orcondition to be corrected, the patient may receive a seda-tive for relaxation, a local anesthetic drug to numb thearea, and/or an anesthetic agent to induce unconscious-ness prior to the surgery.\nAftercare\nA patient whose jaw has been wired will not be able\nto eat solid foods for several weeks. In order for the boneand surrounding tissues to heal, it is important to maintainadequate nutrition . A liquid diet that can be consumed\nthrough a straw, will be required. Soft, precooked foodscan be liquefied in a blender, however, it may be difficultfor the patient to consume adequate calories, protein, vit-\namins , and minerals with this type of diet. Liquid diet\nformulas may be a good alternative. The patient will alsohave to be taught how to care for the mouth, teeth, andinjured area while the wires are in place.\nRisks\nIt is possible that scarring may occur due to the need\nto make small incisions in the skin in order to insert thewires. With any surgical procedure, there are risks asso-ciated with the anesthetic drugs used and the possibilityof infection. If there is a risk that the patient may vomit,the jaw wiring may pose a choking hazard.

The word circadian comes from theLatin, circa , meaning about, and dies, meaning day.\nThese cycles are not exactly 24 hours long, hence the“circa.” Each chemical has its own cycle of highs andlows, interacting with and influencing the other cycles.Body temperature, sleepiness, thyroid function, growthhormone, metabolic processes, adrenal hormones, andthe sleep hormone melatonin all cycle with daylight.There is a direct connection between the retina (wherelight hits the back of the eye) and the part of the brainthat controls all these hormones. Artificial light has someeffect, but sunlight has much more.\nWhen people are without clocks in a compartment\nthat is completely closed to sunlight, most of them fallinto a circadian cycle of about 25 hours. Normally, all theregulating chemicals follow one another in order likethreads in a weaving pattern. Every morning the sunlightresets the cycle, stimulating the leading chemicals andthus compensating for the difference between the 24-hour day and the 25-hour innate rhythm.\nWhen traveling through a number of time zones,\nmost people reset their rhythms within a few days,demonstrating the adaptability of the human species.Some people, however, have upset rhythms that lastindefinitely.\nCauses and symptoms\nTraveling through a few time zones at a time is not\nas disruptive to circadian rhythms as traveling around theworld can be. The foremost symptom of jet lag is alteredsleep pattern—sleepiness during the day, and insomniaduring the night. Jet lag may also include indigestion\nand trouble concentrating. Individuals afflicted by jet lagwill alternate in and out of a normal day-night cycle.\nTreatment\nIn cases of short-term insomnia triggered by jet lag,\na physician may recommend sleeping pills or prescrip-tion medication. Such medication should only be takenunder the guidance of a health care professional.\nAlternative treatment\nExposure to bright morning sunlight cures jet lag\nafter a few days in most people. A few will have pro-longed sleep phase difficulties. For these, there is a curi-ous treatment that has achieved success. By forcing one’sself into a 27 hour day, complete with the appropriatestimulation from bright light, all the errant chemicalcycles will be able to catch up during one week.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1886Jet lagWhen selecting an international flight, individuals\nshould try to arrange an early evening arrival in their des-tination city. When an individual is traveling to a destina-tion in the east, he or she can try going to bed and wakingup a few hours earlier several days before their flight. Iftravel is to the west, going to bed and waking up laterthan usual can help the body start to adjust to the upcom-ing time change.\nThe following precautions taken during an interna-\ntional flight can help to limit or prevent jet lag:\n• Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water and juices to pre-\nvent dehydration . Beverages and foods with caffeine\nshould be avoided because of their stimulant properties.Alcohol should also be avoided.\n• Stretch and walk. As much movement as possible dur-\ning a flight helps circulation, which moves nutrientsand waste through the body and aids in elimination.\n• Stay on time. Set watches and clocks ahead to the time\nin the destination city to start adjusting to the change.\n• Sleep smart. Draw the shade and sleep during the\nevening hours in the destination city, even if it is stilldaylight outside of the airplane. Earplugs and sleepmasks may be helpful in blocking noise and light.Many airlines provide these items on internationalflights.\n• Dress comfortably. Wear or bring comfortable clothes\nand slippers that will make sleeping during the flighteasier.\nOnce arriving in their destination city, individuals\nshould spend as much time outdoors in the sunlight aspossible during the day to reset their internal clock andlessen the symptoms of jet lag. Bedtime should be post-poned until at least 10 P.M., with no daytime naps. If adaytime nap is absolutely necessary, it should be limitedto no more than two hours.\nTo promote a restful sleeping environment in a hotel\nsetting, individuals should request that the hotel deskhold all phone calls. Because sleeping in too late can alsoprolong jet lag, an early wake up call should be requestedif an alarm clock is not available. If the hotel room isnoisy, a portable white noise machine can help to blockoutside traffic and hallway noises. A room air condition-er or fan can serve the same purpose. The temperature inthe room should also be adjusted for sleeping comfort.\nAll antioxidants help to decrease the effects of jet\nlag. Extra doses of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as zinc\nand selenium, two days before and two days after a flighthelp to alleviate jet lag. Melatonin, a hormone whichhelps to regulate circadian rhythms, can also help tocombat jet lag. Melatonin is available as an over-the-counter supplement in most health food stores and phar-KEY TERMS\nHormone —A chemical made in one part of the\nbody that has an effect on another part.\nMelatonin —A hormone which helps to regulate\ncircadian rhythms.\nmacies, but no more than 3 mg should be used in a 24-\nhour period.\nIf weather prevents an individual from spending\ntime in the sunlight, light therapy may be beneficial indecreasing jet lag symptoms. Light therapy, or pho-\ntotherapy , uses a device called a light box, which con-\ntains a set of fluorescent or incandescent lights in front ofa reflector. Typically, the patient sits for 30 minutes nextto a 10,000-lux box (which is about 50 times as bright asan ordinary indoor light). Light therapy is safe for mostpeople, but those with eye diseases should consult ahealthcare professional before undergoing the treatment.\nPrognosis\nJet lag usually lasts 24–48 hours after travel has\ntaken place. In that short time period, the body adjusts tothe time change, and with enough rest and daytime expo-sure to sunlight, it returns to normal circadian rhythm.\nPrevention\nEating a high protein diet that is low in calories before\nintended travel may help reduce the effects of jet lag.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCzeisler, Charles A., and Gary S.

It is usually reserved for more diffi-cult cases where the diagnosis is not clear. The test canbe used to diagnose bacterial or fungal infections, anabnormal buildup of iron, cancer , or other diseases.\nPrecautions\nThe procedure must be done under very sterile con-\nditions to reduce the risk of infection.\nDescription\nThe test is performed either in the doctor’s office,\nclinic, or hospital by a surgeon. There are many differentways to perform this biopsy: through an incision in thejoint; with a scope inserted in the joint; or, more typical-ly, by the insertion of a sharp instrument through theskin. The procedure can be taken from any joint, but themost common joint requiring biopsy is the knee. A sharpinstrument (trocar) is pushed into the joint space. A nee-dle with an attached syringe is inserted into the joint towithdraw fluid for laboratory analysis. The surgeon mayinstill numbing medicine into the joint and along the nee-dle track before the needle is withdrawn. The trocar andthen the biopsy needle is inserted and specimens taken.After the specimen is taken, both the trocar and the biop-sy needle are removed, a bandage is placed over the joint,and the samples are sent to pathology for analysis.\nPreparation\nBlood tests will be done to check that blood clots\nproperly. A mild sedative may be given before the proce-dure. With the patient lying down, the skin over the jointis disinfected and a local anesthetic is injected into theskin and tissue just below the skin.\nAftercare\nThe joint will need rest for at least one day. Normal\nactivity can resume if there is no increased pain or\nswelling.\nRisks\nThere is a chance of joint swelling or tenderness.\nRarely, bleeding and infection can occur in the joint, orthe biopsy needle could break off or strike a nerve orblood vessel.

    "content": "Joint fluid analysis\nDefinition\nJoint fluid analysis, also called synovial fluid analy-\nsis, or arthrocentesis, is a procedure used to assess joint-related abnormalities, such as in the knee or elbow.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a joint fluid analysis is to identify the\ncause of swelling in the joints, to relieve pain and disten-\ntion from fluid accumulation in the joint, and to diagnosecertain types of arthritis and inflammatory joint diseases.The test is also a method to determine whether an infec-tion, either bacterial or fungal, exists within the joint.\nPrecautions\nJoint fluid analysis should not be performed on any\npatient who is uncooperative, especially if the patientcannot or will not keep the joint immobile throughout theprocedure. Patients with certain infections should beexcluded from the procedure, particularly those whohave a local infection along the proposed needle track.The joint space should be accessible. Therefore, a poorlyaccessible joint space, such as in hip aspiration in anobese patient, should not be subject to this procedure.\nDescription\nThe test is also called arthrocentesis, joint tap, and\nclosed joint aspiration. Normal synovial fluid is a clear orpale-yellow fluid found in small amounts in joints, bursae(fluid-filled sac found on points of friction, like joints), andtendon sheaths. The procedure is done by passing a needleinto a joint space and sucking out (aspirating) synovialfluid for diagnostic analysis. When the sample is sent to thelaboratory, the fluid is analyzed for color, clarity, quantity,and chemical composition. It is also examined microscopi-cally to check for the presence of bacteria and other cells.\nThe procedure takes about 10 minutes. Prior to the\nprocedure, any risks that are involved should beexplained to the patient. No intravenous pain medica-tions or sedatives are required, although the patient willbe given a local anesthetic.\nThe patient is asked to lie on their back and remain\nrelaxed. The local anesthetic, typically an injection oflidocaine, is then administered. The clinician is usuallyseated next to the patient. Then the clinician marks exact-KEY TERMS\nAspirate —The removal by suction of a fluid from a\nbody cavity using a needle.\nBursae —A closed sac lined with a synovial mem-\nbrane and filled with fluid, usually found in areassubject to friction, such as where a tendon passesover a bone.\nHematoma —A localized mass of blood that is\nconfined within an organ or tissue.\nSynovial fluid —A transparent lubricating fluid\nsecreted in a sac to protect an area where a ten-don passes over a bone.\nly where the needle is to enter. As the needle enters the\njoint, a “pop” may be felt or heard. This is normal. Cor-rect placement of the needle in the joint space is normallypainless. At this point, the clinician slowly drains some ofthe fluid into the syringe. The needle is then withdrawnand adhesive tape is placed over the needle site.\nPreparation\nGlucose, or sugar, in the joint can be a signal of\narthritis. If the clinician will be doing a glucose test, thepatient will be asked to fast for 6-12 hours preceding theprocedure. If not, there is no special preparation requiredfor a joint fluid analysis.\nAftercare\nSome post-procedural pain may be experienced. For\nthis reason, the patient should arrange to be driven homeby someone else. Aftercare of the joints will depend onthe results of the analysis.\nRisks\nWhile joint fluid analysis is generally a safe proce-\ndure, especially when performed on a large, easily acces-sible joint, such as the knee, some risks are possible.Some of the complications to the procedure, althoughrare, include infection at the site of the needle stick, anaccumulation of blood (hematoma) formation, local pain,injury to cartilage, tendon rupture, and nerve damage.\nNormal results\nThe results of a normal joint fluid analysis include\nfluid of a clear or pale-yellow color and the absence ofbacteria, fungus, and other cells, such as white blood cells.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1889Joint fluid analysisThe components of a prosthetic hip joint, removed due to\nloosening.

    "title": "Joint replacement",
    "content": "Joint replacement\nDefinition\nJoint replacement is the surgical replacement of a\njoint with an artificial prosthesis.\nPurpose\nGreat advances have been made in joint replacement\nsince the first hip replacement was performed in the Unit-ed States in 1969. Improvements have been made in theendurance and compatibility of materials used and thesurgical techniques to install artificial joints. Customjoints can be made using a mold of the original joint thatduplicate the original with a very high degree of accuracy.\nThe most common joints to be replaced are hips and\nknees. There is ongoing work on elbow and shoulderreplacement, but some joint problems are still treatedwith joint resection (the surgical removal of the joint inquestion) or interpositional reconstruction (the reassem-bly of the joint from constituent parts).\nSeventy percent of joint replacements are performed\nbecause arthritis has caused the joint to stiffen andbecome painful to the point where normal daily activitiesare no longer possible. If the joint does not respond toconservative treatment like medication, weight loss,activity restriction, and use of walking aids such as acane, joint replacement is considered appropriate.\nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis or other connec-\ntive tissue diseases may also be candidates for jointreplacement, but the results are usually less satisfactoryin those patients. Elderly people who fall and break theirhip often undergo hip replacement when the probabilityof successful bone healing is low.\nMore than 170,000 hip replacements are performed\nin the United States each year. Since the lifetime of theartificial joint is limited, the best candidates for jointreplacement are over age 60.\nPrecautions\nJoint replacements are performed successfully on an\nolder- than-average group of patients. People with dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1890Joint replacementeases that interfere with blood clotting are not good can-\ndidates for joint replacement. Joint replacement surgeryshould not be done on patients with infection, or anyheart, kidney or lung problems that would make it riskyto undergo general anesthesia.\nDescription\nJoint replacements are performed under general or\nregional anesthesia in a hospital by an orthopedic surgeon.Some medical centers specialize in joint replacement, andthese centers generally have a higher success rate than lessspecialized facilities. The specific techniques of jointreplacement vary depending on the joint involved.\nHip Replacement\nThe surgeon makes an incision along the top of the\nthigh bone (femur) and pulls the thigh bone away fromthe socket of the hip bone (the acetabulum). An artificialKEY TERMS\nCatheterization —Inserting a tube into the bladder\nso that a patient can urinate without leaving the bed.\nProsthesis —A synthetic replacement for a missing\npart of the body, such as a knee or a hip.\nRheumatoid arthritis —A joint disease of unknown\norigins that may begin at an early age causingdeformity and loss of function in the joints.\nsocket made of metal coated with polyethylene (plastic)\nto reduce friction is inserted in the hip. The top of thethigh bone is cut, and a piece of artificial thigh made ofmetal is fitted into the lower thigh bone on one end andthe new socket on the other.\nThe artificial hip can either be held in place by a\nsynthetic cement or by natural bone in-growth. Thecement is an acrylic polymer. It assures good locking ofthe prosthesis to the remaining bone. However, bubblesleft in the cement after it cures may act as weak spots,causing the development of cracks. This promotes loos-ening of the prosthesis later in life. If additional surgeryis needed, all the cement must be removed before surgerycan be performed.\nAn artificial hip fixed by natural bone in-growth\nrequires more precise surgical techniques to assure maxi-mum contact between the remaining natural bone and theprosthesis. The prosthesis is made so that it contains smallpores that encourage the natural bone to grow into it.Growth begins 6 to 12 weeks after surgery. The short termoutcome with non-cemented hips is less satisfactory, withpatients reporting more thigh pain , but the long term out-\nlook is better, with fewer cases of hip loosening in non-cemented hips. The trend is to use the non-cemented tech-nique. Hospital stays last from four to eight days.\nKnee Replacement\nThe doctor puts a tourniquet above the knee, than\nmakes a cut to expose the knee joint. The ligaments sur-rounding the knee are loosened, then the shin bone andthigh bone are cut and the knee removed. The artificialknee is then cemented into place on the remaining stubs ofthose bones. The excess cement is removed, and the kneeis closed. Hospital stays range from three to six days.\nIn both types of surgery, preventing infection is very\nimportant. Antibiotics are given intravenously and contin-\nued in pill form after the surgery. Fluid and blood loss canbe great, and sometimes blood transfusions are needed.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1891Joint replacement\nA false color x-ray image of the human pelvis showing a\nprosthetic hip joint. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-\nduced by permission.)Preparation\nMany patients choose to donate their own blood for\ntransfusion during the surgery. This prevents any blood\nincompatibility problems or the transmission of blood-borne diseases.\nPrior to surgery, all the standard preoperative blood\nand urine tests are performed, and the patient meets withthe anesthesiologist to discuss any special conditions thataffect the administration of anesthesia. Patients receivinggeneral anesthesia should not eat or drink for 10 hoursprior to the operation.\nAftercare\nImmediately after the operation the patient will be\ncatheterized so that he or she will not have to get out ofbed to urinate. The patient will be monitored for infec-tion. Antibiotics are continued and pain medication is pre-scribed. Physical therapy begins (first passive exercises,then active ones) as soon as possible using a walker, cane,or crutches for additional support. Long term care of theartificial joint involves refraining from heavy activity andheavy lifting, and learning how to sit, walk, how to get outof beds, chairs, and cars so as not to dislocate the joint.\nRisks\nThe immediate risks during and after surgery\ninclude the development of blood clots that may comeloose and block the arteries, excessive loss of blood, andinfection. Blood thinning medication is usually given toreduce the risk of clots forming. Some elderly peopleexperience short term confusion and disorientation fromthe anesthesia.\nAlthough joint replacement surgery is highly suc-\ncessful, there is an increased risk of nerve injury. Dislo-cation or fracture of the hip joint is also a possibility.Infection caused by the operation can occur as long as ayear later and can be difficult to treat. Some doctors addantibiotics directly to the cement used to fix the replace-ment joint in place. Loosening of the joint is the mostcommon cause of failure in hip joints that are not infect-ed. This may require another joint replacement surgery inabout 12% of patients within a 15-year period followingthe first procedure.\nNormal results\nOver 90% of patients receiving hip replacements\nachieve complete relief from pain and significantimprovement in joint function. The success rate is slight-ly lower in knee replacements, and drops still more forother joint replacement operations.Resources\nPERIODICALS\nSiopack, Jorge, and Harry Jergensen. “Total Hip Arthroplasty.”\nIn Western Journal of Medicine (Mar. 1995): 43-50.\nTish Davidson\nJoint resection seeArthroplasty\nJoint x rays seeArthrography"

The simplest model of a synovial joint involvestwo bones, separated by a slight gap called the joint cavi-ty. The ends of each articular bone are covered by a layerof cartilage. Both articular bones and the joint cavity aresurrounded by a tough tissue called the articular capsule.The articular capsule has two components: the fibrousmembrane on the outside, and the synovial membrane(or synovium) on the inside. The fibrous membrane mayinclude tough bands of fibrous tissue called ligaments,which are responsible for providing support to the joints.The synovial membrane has special cells and many cap-illaries (tiny blood vessels). This membrane produces asupply of synovial fluid which fills the joint cavity, lubri-cates it, and helps the articular bones move smoothlyabout the joint.\nIn JA, the synovial membrane becomes intensely\ninflamed. Usually thin and delicate, the synoviumbecomes thick and stiff, with numerous infoldings on itssurface. The membrane becomes invaded by white bloodcells, which produce a variety of destructive chemicals.The cartilage along the articular surfaces of the bonesmay be attacked and destroyed, and the bone, articular\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1892Juvenile arthritiscapsule, and ligaments may begin to be worn away\n(eroded). These processes severely interfere with move-ment in the joint.\nJA specifically refers to chronic arthritic conditions\nthat affect a child under the age of 16 years, and that last fora minimum of three to six months. JA is often characterizedby a waxing and waning course, with flares separated byperiods of time during which no symptoms are noted(remission). Some literature refers to JA as juvenilerheumatoid arthritis , although most types of JA differ\nsignificantly from the adult disease called rheumatoidarthritis, in terms of symptoms, progression, and prognosis.\nCauses and symptoms\nA number of different causes have been sought to\nexplain the onset of JA. There seems to be some geneticlink, based on the fact that the tendency to develop JAsometimes runs in a particular family, and based on thefact that certain genetic markers are more frequentlyfound in patients with JA and other related diseases.Many researchers have looked for some infectious causefor JA, but no clear connection to a particular organismhas ever been made. JA is considered by some to be anautoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur\nwhen the body’s immune system mistakenly identifiesthe body’s own tissue as foreign, and goes about attack-ing those tissues, as if trying to rid the body of an invader(such as a bacteria, virus, or fungi). While an autoim-mune mechanism is strongly suspected, certain markersof such a mechanism (such as rheumatoid factor, oftenpresent in adults with such disorders) are rarely presentin children with JA.\nJoint symptoms of arthritis may include stiffness,\npain , redness and warmth of the joint, and swelling.\nBone in the area of an affected joint may grow too quick-ly, or too slowly, resulting in limbs that are of differentlengths. When the child tries to avoid moving a painfuljoint, the muscle may begin to shorten from disuse. Thisis called a contracture.\nSymptoms of JA depend on the particular subtype.\nJA is classified by the symptoms that appear within thefirst six months of the disorder:\n• Pauciarticular JA: This is the most common and the\nleast severe type of JA, affecting about 40-60% of allJA patients. This type of JA affects fewer than fourjoints, usually the knee, ankle, wrist, and/or elbow.Other more general (systemic) symptoms are usuallyabsent, and the child’s growth usually remains normal.Very few children (less than 15%) with pauciarticularJA end up with deformed joints. Some children withthis form of JA experience painless swelling of thejoint. Some children with JA have a serious inflamma-tion of structures within the eye, which if left undiag-\nnosed and untreated could even lead to blindness.While many children have cycles of flares and remis-sions, in some children the disease completely and per-manently resolves within a few years of diagnosis.\n• Polyarticular JA: About 40% of all cases of JA are of\nthis type. More girls than boys are diagnosed with thisform of JA. This type of JA is most common in childrenup to age three, or after the age of 10. Polyarticular JAaffects five or more joints simultaneously. This type ofJA usually affects the small joints of both hands andboth feet, although other large joints may be affected aswell. Some patients with arthritis in their knees willexperience a different rate of growth in each leg. Ulti-mately, one leg will grow longer than the other. Abouthalf of all patients with polyarticular JA have arthritisof the spine and/or hip. Some patients with polyarticu-lar JA will have other symptoms of a systemic illness,including anemia (low red blood cell count), decreasedgrowth rate, low appetite, low-grade fever , and a slight\nrash. The disease is most severe in those children whoare diagnosed in early adolescence. Some of these chil-dren will test positive for a marker present in otherautoimmune disorders, called rheumatoid factor (RF).RF is found in adults who have rheumatoid arthritis.Children who are positive for RF tend to have a moresevere course, with a disabling form of arthritis whichdestroys and deforms the joints. This type of arthritis isthought to be the adult form of rheumatoid arthritisoccurring at a very early age.\n• Systemic onset JA: Sometimes called Still disease (after\na physician who originally described it), this type of JAoccurs in about 10-20% off all patients with JA. Boysand girls are equally affected, and diagnosis is usuallymade between the ages of 5-10 years. The initial symp-toms are not usually related to the joints. Instead, thesechildren have high fevers; a rash; decreased appetite andweight loss; severe joint and muscle pain; swollenlymph nodes, spleen, and liver; and serious anemia.Some children experience other complications, includ-ing inflammation of the sac containing the heart ( peri-\ncarditis ); inflammation of the tissue lining the chest\ncavity and lungs (pleuritis); and inflammation of theheart muscle ( myocarditis ). The eye inflammation\noften seen in pauciarticular JA is uncommon in systemiconset JA. Symptoms of actual arthritis begin later in thecourse of systemic onset JA, and they often involve thewrists and ankles. Many of these children continue tohave periodic flares of fever and systemic symptomsthroughout childhood. Some children will go on todevelop a polyarticular type of JA.\n• Spondyloarthropathy: This type of JA most commonly\naffects boys older than eight years of age. The arthritis\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1893Juvenile arthritisoccurs in the knees and ankles, moving over time to\ninclude the hips and lower spine. Inflammation of theeye may occur occasionally, but usually resolves with-out permanent damage.\n• Psoriatic JA: This type of arthritis usually shows up in\nfewer than four joints, but goes on to include multiplejoints (appearing similar to polyarticular JA). Hips,back, fingers, and toes are frequently affected. A skincondition called psoriasis accompanies this type of\narthritis. Children with this type of JA often have pits orridges in their fingernails. The arthritis usually pro-gresses to become a serious, disabling problem.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of JA is often made on the basis of the\nchild’s collection of symptoms. Laboratory tests oftenshow normal results. Some nonspecific indicators ofinflammation may be elevated, including white bloodcell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate , and a mark-\ner called C-reactive protein. As with any chronic disease,anemia may be noted. Children with an extraordinarilyearly onset of the adult type of rheumatoid arthritis willhave a positive test for rheumatoid factor.\nTreatment\nTreating JA involves efforts to decrease the amount of\ninflammation, in order to preserve movement. Medica-tions which can be used for this include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (such as ibuprofen and naproxen).Oral (by mouth) steroid medications are effective, but havemany serious side effects with long-term use. Injections ofsteroids into an affected joint can be helpful. Steroid eyedrops are used to treat eye inflammation. Other drugs thathave been used to treat JA include methotrexate, sul-fasalazine, penicillamine, and hydroxychloroquine. Physi-cal therapy and exercises are often recommended in orderKEY TERMS\nArticular bones —Two or more bones that are con-\nnected with each other via a joint.\nJoint —Structures that hold two or more bones\ntogether.\nSynovial joint —A particular type of joint, which\nallows for movement in the articular bones.\nSynovial membrane —The membrane that lines\nthe inside of the articular capsule of a joint, andproduces a lubricating fluid called synovial fluid.to improve joint mobility and to strengthen supporting\nmuscles. Occasionally, splints are used to rest painfuljoints and to try to prevent or improve deformities.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments that have been suggested for\narthritis include juice therapy, which can work to detoxifythe body, helping to reduce JA symptoms. Some recom-mended fruits and vegetables to include in the juice are car-rots, celery, cabbage, potatoes, cherries, lemons, beets,cucumbers, radishes, and garlic. Tomatoes and other veg-etables in the nightshade (potatoes, eggplant, red and greenpeppers) are discouraged. As an adjunct therapy, aro-\nmatherapy preparations utilize cypress, fennel, and lemon.\nMassage oils include rosemary, benzoin, chamomile, cam-phor, juniper, and lavender. Other types of therapy whichhave been used include acupuncture ,acupressure , and\nbody work. Nutritional supplements that may be beneficialinclude large amounts of antioxidants ( vitamins C, A, E,\nzinc, selenium, and flavenoids), as well as B vitamins and afull complement of minerals (including boron, copper,\nmanganese). Other nutrients that assist in detoxifying thebody, including methionine, cysteine, and other aminoacids, may also be helpful. A number of autoimmune disor-ders, including JA, seem to have a relationship to foodallergies . Identification and elimination of reactive foods\nmay result in a decrease in JA symptoms. Constitutionalhomeopathy can also work to quiet the symptoms of JA\nand bring about balance to the whole person.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for pauciarticular JA is quite good, as\nis the prognosis for spondyloarthropathy. PolyarticularJA carries a slightly worse prognosis. RF-positive pol-yarticular JA carries a difficult prognosis, often with pro-gressive, destructive arthritis and joint deformities. Sys-temic onset JA has a variable prognosis, depending onthe organ systems affected, and the progression to pol-yarticular JA. About 1-5% of all JA patients die of suchcomplications as infection, inflammation of the heart, orkidney disease.\nPrevention\nBecause so little is known about what causes JA,\nthere are no recommendations available for how to avoiddeveloping it.\nResources\nBOOKS\nKredich, Deborah Welt. “Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis.” In\nRudolph’s Pediatric , ed.

It is most often found in patientswith acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ),\nand can be fatal.\nDescription\nKaposi’s sarcoma (KS) was once a very rare form of\ncancer, primarily affecting elderly men of Mediterraneanand eastern European background, until the 1980s, whenit began to appear among AIDS patients. It manifests infour distinct forms. The first form, called classic KS, wasdescribed by the Austrian dermatologist Moricz Kaposimore than a century ago. Classic KS usually affects oldermen of Mediterranean or eastern European backgroundsby producing tumors on the lower legs. Though at timespainful and disfiguring, they are not generally life-threat-ening. The second form of the disease, African endemicKS, primarily affects boys and men. It can appear asclassic KS, or in a more deadly form that quickly spreadsto tissues below the skin, the bones and lymph system,leading to death within a few years of diagnosis. Another\nform of KS, iatrogenic KS, is observed in kidney andliver transplant patients who take immunosuppressivedrugs to prevent rejection of their organ transplant. Iatro-genic KS usually reverses after the immunosuppressivedrug is stopped. The fourth form of KS, AIDS- relatedKS, emerged as one of the first illnesses observed amongthose with AIDS. Unlike classic KS, AIDS-related KS,tumors generally appear on the upper body, including thehead, neck, and back. The tumors also can appear on thesoft palate and gum areas of the mouth, and in moreadvanced cases, they can be found in the stomach andintestines, the lymph nodes, and the lungs,\nKaposi’s sarcoma is reported to be found in 20% of\nhomosexual men who have HIV , 3% in heterosexualintravenous drug users, 3% in women and children, 3%in transfusion recipients, and 1% in hemophiliacs. Once\nregarded as only a defining illness for AIDS, KS hasproven to be a progressive, fatal disease on its own, espe-cially when the disease becomes systemic. Yet, involve-ment throughout the body is not the only factor in patientmortality. Research in 2000 found that patients with KSin oral mucosa had a higher risk of death than those withKS appearing only on the skin.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nA variety of factors appear to contribute to the devel-\nopment of KS. One of the first avenues offered as causalagents was genetic predisposition. People with classicKS, and those who develop the tumors after transplanta-tion, are more likely than others to possess a geneticallydetermined immune factor called HLA-DR. Cases of KSthat run in families, however, are rare.\nThe fact that the disease is more likely to afflict men\nthan women suggests sex hormones, such as testosteronein men, may stimulate the growth of KS tumors, and thatestrogen in women may retard their growth.\nImmune suppression was the next likely cause since\nliver, kidney, and bone marrow patients who take immuno-suppressive drugs to prevent transplant rejection frequent-ly develop KS lesions. Similarly, KS has been observed inpatients receiving systemic treatment with high- dose cor-\nticosteroids , which also suppresses the immune system.\nImmune suppression is the hallmark of AIDS.\nThe current theory is the discovery of an infectious\nagent. A number of viruses have been proposed as possi-ble causes, including cytomegalovirus and human papil-loma virus, fragments of which have been found in KSK\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1897tumor specimens. A more likely candidate, however, is a\nnew herpes virus that has been called human herpes virus8 (HHV-8) or KS-associated herpes virus (KSHV). Sincefragments of the virus were first disclosed in KS samplesin 1994, they have since been found in KS samples takenfrom patients with classic KS, African endemic KS, andKS in transplant patients. Fragments of HHV-8, however,have also been found in patients who have other skin dis-eases but who do not have KS,\nStudies in 2000 showed that HHV-8 was indeed the\nculprit behind KS. Nevertheless, it does not work alone.In combination with a patient’s altered response tocytokines (regulatory proteins that are produced by theimmune system) and the HIV-1 transactivating proteinTat which promotes the growth of endothelial cells,HHV-8 can then encode interleukin 6 viral proteins, spe-cific cytokines that stimulate cell growth in the skin. Thisbecomes KS.\nHHV-8 destroys the immune system further by\ndirecting a cell to remove the major histocompatibilitycomplex (MHC-1) proteins that protect it from invasion.These proteins are then transferred to the interior of thecell and are destroyed. This leaves the cell unguardedand vulnerable to invaders which would normally be tar-geted for attack by the immune system.\nResearch in early 2001 showed that transmission of\nHHV-8 virus can be more casual than was once thought,giving rise to incidence among women and children.Women who are intravenous drug users and who also\nhave had a sexually transmitted disease have been foundto harbor HHV-8. This evidence shows that women cancontract HHV-8 through blood. In addition, researchersin 2000 found that HHV-8 could be transmitted orallythough kissing. This study found more HHV-8 virus inoral samples than in genital secretions. In fact, HHV-8was difficult to find in genital samples. This may indicatewhy children and women who were not intravenous drugusers have had KS.\nSymptoms\nKaposi’s sarcoma produces pink, purple, or brown\ntumors on the skin, mucous membranes, or internalorgans.\nDiagnosis\nMany physicians will diagnose KS based on the\nappearance of the skin tumors and the patient’s medicalhistory. Unexplained cough or chest pain , as well as\nunexplained stomach or intestinal pain or bleeding, couldsuggest that the disease has moved beyond the skin. Themost certain diagnosis can be achieved by taking a biop-sy sample of a suspected KS lesion and examining itunder high-power magnification. For suspected involve-ment of internal organs, physicians will use a broncho-scope to examine the lungs or an endoscope to view thestomach and intestinal tract.\nTreatment\nTreatment goals for KS are simple: to reduce the\nseverity of symptoms, shrink tumors, and prevent diseaseprogression. Unfortunately, there is no single best treat-ment plan that can achieve all of those goals. Treatmentsrange from topical agents for mild disease with fewtumors to more aggressive systemic chemotherapy for\nmore serious KS that has spread to large areas of skin orthe internal organs. Physicians will frequently combinetopical, radiation, and various systemic chemotherapydrugs, depending on the sites of the body affected, thespeed at which it is progressing, and the patient’s overallhealth, among other considerations.\nLocal therapy\nWhen the number of KS tumors is small and the dis-\nease appears to be progressing slowly, physicians havehad great success with the application, by the patient, ofa topical gel containing alitretinoin. This product is a nat-urally occurring retinoid (a derivative of vitamin A) thatcan inhibit cell growth and activate apoptosis (celldeath). Patients tolerate the product well with only mild\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1898Kaposi’s sarcoma\nThis HIV-positive patient is afflicted with Kaposi’s sarcoma\ninside the mouth. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced\nby permission.)to moderate skin irritation at the site of application in\nsome individuals. Duration of treatment is long term,with the patient seeing results after four to eight weeks oftherapy. Treatment slows the progress of the disease andreduces the size of the lesions.\nOther local treatments include cryotherapy (using a\nliquid nitrogen spray or probe to freeze the tumor), injec-tions of vinblastine (a drug also used for systemicchemotherapy) directly into the tumor, laser therapy, orradiation therapy targeted at the tumor sites. These\nmethods have some success, but they also have unpleas-ant side effects. Vinblastine injections are about 70%effective, but they do not resolve the lesions completely.\nSystemic chemotherapy\nWith widespread KS lesions over the body surface,\nor evidence of spread to other parts of the body, physi-cians will consider systemic chemotherapy drugs. A newclass of chemotherapy drugs, called liposomal anthracy-clines, appears to produce good results with fewer toxicside effects than do more conventional chemotherapydrugs. Two of these drugs, liposomal doxorubicin(Doxil) and liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXone) havebecome the treatment of choice. These drugs last longerin the human body, demonstrate higher concentrations ofthe drug in tumors, and have fewer toxic side effects,\nPaclitaxel (Taxol) is the newest drug in the KS arse-\nnal. It has a 75% effective rate and is very effective inpatients who are resistant to anthracycline drugs. The 3-hour infusion time and the incidence of bone marrowsuppression, hair loss, and joint and muscle pain make itless attractive to patients.\nAntiviral therapy\nEvidence suggests that for some individuals, the\nclass of AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors , in com-\nbination with other anti-HIV drugs, can reduce the levelsof detectable HIV in the blood to nearly zero, and insome patients stabilize or reverse KS tumors. Moreresearch is needed in this area. Since the discovery ofHHV-8, interest in an antiviral approach to KS hasincreased. There is no evidence, however, that twoantiviral drugs commonly prescribed for herpes, acy-\nclovir and ganciclovir, have any effect on the disease.One study of 20,000 patients with HIV and AIDS foundthat those who took foscarnet, another antiviral medica-tion that works in a different way than acyclovir and gan-ciclovir, were less likely to develop KS tumors.\nAnother treatment source is interferon-alpha, which\nis made by the body and has powerful effects on theimmune system. Investigators have tried injecting itdirectly into lesions, and also in combination with otheranti-HIV drugs such as zidovudine, with some success. It\nhas been used with patients who have KS limited only tothe skin and who have little immunosuppression. Inter-feron-alpha has had poor tumor response and significanttoxic effects in patients, especially those with seriously-depressed immune systems.\nStill other avenues of therapy being researched are\nsex hormones, thalidomide, SU5516 (an endothelialgrowth factor inhibitor), and angiogenesis inhibitors,which prevents the growth of blood vessels within a cellthat supplies oxygen and nutrients. There is also someresearch involving the oral administration of alitretinoin.\nAlternative treatment\nThe Bastyr University AIDS Research Study has\nbeen investigating and collecting data on treatment forKS and other opportunistic conditions that are AIDS-related. Among the treatments under investigation are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1899Kaposi’s sarcoma\nKaposi’s sarcoma usually appears on the lower extremities,\nas evidenced on this patient’s hip. (Custom Medical Stock\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)nutritional and herbal therapies (both internal and exter-\nnal). Bastyr University is located in Seattle, Washington.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for patients with classic KS is good.\nTumors can frequently be controlled and patients fre-quently die of other causes before any serious spread.African endemic KS can progress rapidly and lead topremature death, despite treatment. In AIDS-relatedKS, milder cases can frequently be controlled; the prog-nosis for more advanced and rapidly progressing casesis less certain and dependent on the patient’s overallmedical condition. There are indications that KS can bestabilized or reversed in patients whose level of HIV inthe blood is reduced to undetectable levels via antiretro-viral therapy.\nPrevention\nSafer sex practices may help to prevent AIDS-related\nKS by decreasing the risk of transmission of HHV-8through sexual means.

    "title": "Kawasaki syndrome",
    "content": "Kawasaki syndrome\nDefinition\nKawasaki syndrome is a potentially fatal inflamma-\ntory disease that affects several organ systems in thebody, including the heart, circulatory system, mucousmembranes, skin, and immune system. It occurs primari-ly in infants and children but has also been identified inadults as old as 34 years. Its cause is unknown.\nDescription\nKawasaki syndrome, also called mucocutaneous\nlymph node syndrome (MLNS), is an inflammatory dis-order with potentially fatal complications affecting theheart and its larger arteries. Nearly twice as many males\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1900Kawasaki syndromeare affected as females. Although persons of Asian\ndescent are affected more frequently than either black orwhite individuals, there does not appear to be a distinc-tive geographic pattern of occurrence. Eighty percent ofcases involve children under the age of four. Althoughthe disease usually appears in individuals, it sometimesaffects several members of the same family and occa-sionally occurs in small epidemics.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe specific cause of Kawasaki syndrome is\nunknown, although the disease resembles infectious ill-nesses in many ways. It has been suggested that Kawasa-ki syndrome represents an allergic reaction or otherunusual response to certain types of infections. Someresearchers think that the syndrome may be caused bythe interaction of an immune cell, called the T cell, withcertain poisons (toxins) secreted by bacteria.\nKawasaki syndrome has an abrupt onset, with fever\nas high as 104°F (40°C) and a rash that spreads over thepatient’s chest and genital area. The fever is followed bya characteristic peeling of the skin beginning at the fin-gertips and toenails. In addition to the body rash, thepatient’s lips become very red, with the tongue develop-ing a “strawberry” appearance. The palms, soles, andmucous membranes that line the eyelids and cover theexposed portion of the eyeball (conjuntivae) become pur-plish-red and swollen. The lymph nodes in the patient’sneck may also become swollen. These symptoms maylast from two weeks to three months, with relapses insome patients.\nIn addition to the major symptoms, about 30% of\npatients develop joint pains or arthritis, usually in thelarge joints of the body. Others develop pneumonia ,\ndiarrhea , dry or cracked lips, jaundice , or an inflamma-\ntion of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord(meningitis ). A few patients develop symptoms of\ninflammation in the liver (hepatitis), gallbladder, lungs,or tonsils.\nAbout 20% of patients with Kawasaki syndrome\ndevelop complications of the cardiovascular system.These complications include inflammation of the hearttissue ( myocarditis ), disturbances in heartbeat rhythm\n(arrhythmias ), and areas of blood vessel dilation\n(aneurysms) in the coronary arteries. Other patients maydevelop inflammation of an artery (arteritis) in their armsor legs. Complications of the heart or arteries begin todevelop around the tenth day after the illness begins,when the fever and rash begin to subside. A few patientsmay develop gangrene , or the death of soft tissue, in\ntheir hands and feet. The specific causes of these compli-cations are not yet known.Diagnosis\nBecause Kawasaki syndrome is primarily a disease\nof infants and young children, the disease is most likelyto be diagnosed by a pediatrician. The physician will firstconsider the possible involvement of other diseases thatcause fever and skin rashes , including scarlet fever ,\nmeasles ,Rocky Mountain spotted fever ,toxoplasmo-\nsis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , and a blistering and\ninflammation of the skin caused by reactions to certainmedications (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).\nOnce other diseases have been ruled out, the\npatient’s symptoms will be compared with a set of diag-nostic criteria. The patient must have a fever lasting fivedays or longer that does not respond to antibiotics ,\ntogether with four of the following five symptoms:\n• Inflammation of the conjunctivae of both eyes with no\ndischarge\n• At least one of the following changes in the mucous\nmembranes of the mouth and throat: “strawberry”tongue; cracked lips; or swollen throat tissues\n• At least one of the following changes in the hands or\nfeet: swelling caused by excess fluid in the tissues;peeling of the skin; or abnormal redness of the skin\n• A skin eruption or rash associated with fever (exan-\nthem) on the patient’s trunk\n• Swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck to a size\ngreater than 0.6 in (1.5 cm).\nSince the cause of Kawasaki syndrome is unknown,\nthere are no laboratory tests that can confirm the diagno-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1901Kawasaki syndrome\nAn angiogram showing abnormal coronary arteries in a\nchild suffering from Kawasaki’s disease.The coronary arter-ies are abnormal and weakened in that they bulge into bal-loon shapes, or aneurysms, along their lengths.This illnessafflicts children between the ages of 1-2 years.

The following test results, however, are associated\nwith the disease:\n• Blood tests show a high white blood cell count, high\nplatelet count , a high level of protein in the blood\nserum, and mild anemia.\n• Chest x ray may show enlargement of the heart (car-\ndiomegaly).\n• Urine may show the presence of pus or an abnormally\nhigh level of protein.\n• An electrocardiogram may show changes in the heart-\nbeat rhythm.\nIn addition to these tests, it is important to take a\nseries of echocardiograms during the course of the illnessbecause 20% of Kawasaki patients will develop coronaryaneurysms or arteritis that will not appear during the firstexamination.\nTreatment\nKawasaki syndrome is usually treated with a combi-\nnation of aspirin , to control the patient’s fever and skin\ninflammation, and high doses of intravenous immuneglobulin to reduce the possibility of coronary artery com-plications.

Frey\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1902Kawasaki syndromeKeloids\nDefinition\nKeloids are overgrowths of fibrous tissue or scars\nthat can occur after an injury to the skin. These heavyscars are also called cheloid or hypertrophic scars. Inindividuals prone to keloids, even minor traumas to theskin, such as ear piercing, can cause keloids.\nDescription\nKeloids can occur anywhere on the body, but they\nare most common on the earlobes, upper back, shoulders,and chest. They consist of hard, raised scars that may beslightly pink or whitish. These may itch and be painful,and some keloids can grow to be quite large.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough the cause of keloids is unknown, it is\nthought that they are due to the body’s failure to turn offthe healing process needed to repair skin. When thisoccurs, extra collagen forms at the site of the scar, andkeeps forming because it is not shut off. This results inkeloid formation.\nKeloids occur most frequently in individuals of\nAfrican-American descent and in those with darker skin.Other risk factors include a family history of keloids,surgery, acne ,burns , ear piercing, vaccinations, or even\ninsect bites. In addition, women and young people underthe age of 30 are more prone to develop them.\nInitially, keloids will begin as a small lump where\nthe skin has been injured. This lump grows and can even-tually become very large and cosmetically unacceptable.\nDiagnosis\nA dermatologist can usually make the diagnosis of a\nkeloid based on looking at the scar. In some cases, how-ever, a biopsy may be necessary to rule out other types ofskin lesions , such as tumors.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of choice for keloids is usually an\ninjection of corticosteroid drugs such as cortisone direct-ly into the lesion. These injections cause the keloid tobecome atrophic, or thinner, and are repeated every threeto four weeks until the keloid has been resolved to theindividual’s satisfaction. Other therapies include lasertreatment or radiation therapy , and topical treatments\nare undergoing study.KEY TERMS\nAtrophy —A wasting away of, becoming thinner,\nless strong.\nCorticosteroids —Any of several steroid medica-\ntions used to suppress inflammation, allergic, orimmune responses of the body.\nSurgery is often used in combination with corticos-\nteroid injections. The injections are given for severalweeks, and then the keloid is surgically removed. Theinjections are then continued for several weeks. Surgicalremoval of the keloid may also be used in conjunctionwith radiation therapy, which delivers small amounts ofradiation to the affected area.\nNewer approaches include silastic gel sheeting,\nwhich makes use of pressure to flatten the keloid. The gelis applied and kept securely in place with tape, cloth, oran ace bandage. The dressing is to be changed everyseven to 10 days, for as long as 12 months.\nFinally, researchers are now studying a type of tape\nthat has been soaked with steroids, which are releasedslowly into the keloid, causing it to thin over time.\nPrognosis\nAlthough keloids are unsightly, they are not life\nthreatening. Keloids do not have a tendency to developinto malignancies, but they can become cosmeticallyunacceptable. Keloids can gradually lessen after treat-ment, but many recur. And just as they can occur sponta-neously, they can also resolve spontaneously.\nPrevention\nPreventive measures include avoiding any trauma to\nthe skin, and compression pressure dressing for high-riskpatients who have suffered burns to their skin. Patientswith a tendency to form keloids should avoid any sort ofelective surgery. Individuals who are prone to developkeloids or who have a history of keloids should immedi-ately care for any cuts or abrasions they may sustain.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology. 930 N.

    "title": "Keratitis",
    "content": "Keratitis\nDefinition\nKeratitis is an inflammation of the cornea, the trans-\nparent membrane that covers the colored part of the eye(iris) and pupil of the eye.\nDescription\nThere are many types and causes of keratitis. Kerati-\ntis occurs in both children and adults. Organisms cannotgenerally invade an intact, healthy cornea. However, cer-tain conditions can allow an infection to occur. Forexample, a scratch can leave the cornea open to infection.A very dry eye can also decrease the cornea’s protectivemechanisms.\nRisk factors that increase the likelihood of develop-\ning this condition include:\n• poor contact lens care; overuse of contact lenses\n• illnesses or other factors that reduces the body’s ability\nto overcome infection\n• cold sores, genital herpes , and other viral infections\n• crowded, dirty living conditions; poor hygiene\n• poor nutrition (especially a deficiency of Vitamin A,\nwhich is essential for normal vision)\nSome common types of keratitis are listed below,\nhowever there are many other forms.\nHerpes simplex keratitis\nA major cause of adult eye disease, herpes simplex\nkeratitis may lead to:\n• chronic inflammation of the cornea\n• development of tiny blood vessels in the eye• scarring\n• loss of vision\n• glaucoma\nThis infection generally begins with inflammation of\nthe membrane lining the eyelid (conjunctiva) and theportion of the eyeball that comes into contact with it. Itusually occurs in one eye. Subsequent infections arecharacterized by a pattern of lesions that resemble theveins of a leaf. These infections are called dendritic ker-atitis and aid in the diagnosis.\nRecurrences may be brought on by stress ,fatigue ,\nor ultraviolet light (UV) exposure (e.g., skiing or boatingincrease the exposure of the eye to sunlight; the sunlightreflects off of the surfaces). Repeated episodes of den-dritic keratitis can cause sores, permanent scarring, andnumbness of the cornea.\nRecurrent dendritic keratitis is often followed by\ndisciform keratitis. This condition is characterized byclouding and deep, disc-shaped swelling of the corneaand by inflammation of the iris.\nIt is very important not to use topical corticos-\nteroids with herpes simplex keratitis as it can make it\nmuch worse, possibly leading to blindness.\nBacterial keratitis\nPeople who have bacterial keratitis wake up with\ntheir eyelids stuck together. There can be pain , sensitivi-\nty to light, redness, tearing, and a decrease in vision. Thiscondition, which is usually aggressive, can be caused bywearing soft contact lenses overnight. One study foundthat overnight wear can increase risk by 10-15 timesmore than if wearing daily wear contact lenses. Improperlens care is also a factor. Contaminated makeup can alsocontain bacteria.\nBacterial keratitis makes the cornea cloudy. It may\nalso cause abscesses to develop in the stroma, which islocated beneath the outer layer of the cornea.\nFungal keratitis\nUsually a consequence of injuring the cornea in a\nfarm-like setting or in a place where plant material is pre-sent, fungal keratitis often develops slowly. This condition:\n• usually affects people with weakened immune systems\n• often results in infection within the eyeball• may cause stromal abscesses\nPeripheral ulcerative keratitis\nPeripheral ulcerative keratitis is also called marginal\nkeratolysis or peripheral rheumatoid ulceration. Thiscondition is often associated with active or chronic:\n• rheumatoid arthritis\n• relapsing polychondritis (connective-tissue inflamma-\ntion)\n• wegener’s granulomatosis, a rare condition character-\nized by kidney disease and development of nodules inthe respiratory tract\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1904KeratitisSuperficial punctate keratitis\nOften associated with the type of viruses that cause\nupper respiratory infection (adenoviruses), superficialpunctate keratitis is characterized by destruction of pin-point areas in the outer layer of the cornea (epithelium).One or both eyes may be affected.\nAcanthamoeba keratitis\nThis pus-producing condition is very painful. It is a\ncommon source of infection in people who wear soft orrigid contact lenses. It can be found in tap water, soil, andswimming pools.\nPhotokeratitis\nPhotokeratitis or snowblindness is caused by excess\nexposure to UV light. This can occur with sunlight, sun-tanning lamps, or a welding arc. It is called snowblind-ness because the sunlight is reflected off of the snow. Ittherefore can occur in water sports as well, because ofthe reflection of light off of the water. It is very painfuland may occur several hours after exposure. It may lastone to two days.\nInterstitial keratitis\nAlso called parenchymatous keratitis, interstitial\nkeratitis is a chronic inflammation of tissue deep withinthe cornea. Interstitial keratitis is rare in the UnitedStates. Interstitial keratitis affects both eyes and usuallyoccurs as a complication of congenital or acquiredsyphilis . In congenital syphilis it can occur between age\ntwo and puberty . It may also occur in people with\ntuberculosis ,leprosy , or other diseases.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn summary, keratitis can be caused by:\n• bacterial, viral, or fungal infections\n• dry eyes resulting from disorders of the eyelid or\ndiminished ability to form tears\n• exposure to very bright light\n•foreign objects that injure or become lodged in the eye\n• sensitivity or allergic reactions to eye makeup, dust,\npollen, pollution, or other irritants\n• vitamin A deficiency, which people with normal diets\nrarely develop\nSymptoms of keratitis include, but are not limited to:\n• tearing\n• pain\n• sensitivity to light• inflammation of the eyelid\n• decrease in vision\n• redness\nDiagnosis\nA case history will be taken and the vision will be\ntested. Examination with a slit lamp, an instrument that’sa microscope and focuses a beam of light on the eye, isimportant for diagnosis. The cornea can be examined withfluorescein, a yellow dye which will highlight defects inthe cornea. Deeper layers of the cornea can also be exam-ined with the slit lamp. Infiltrates, hazy looking areas inthe cornea, can be seen by the doctor and will aid in thediagnosis. Samples of infectious matter removed from theeye will be sent for laboratory analysis.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics , antifungals, and antiviral medication\nwill be used to treat the appropriate organism. Broadspectrum antibiotics will be used immediately, but oncethe lab analysis determines the offending organism themedication may be changed. Sometimes more than onemedication is necessary. It depends upon the infection,but the patient should be clear on how often and how touse the medications.\nA sterile, cotton-tipped applicator may be used to\ngently remove infected tissue and allow the eye to healmore rapidly. Laser surgery is sometimes performed to\ndestroy unhealthy cells, and some severe infectionsrequire corneal transplants.\nAntifungal, antibiotic, or antiviral eyedrops or oint-\nments are usually prescribed to cure keratitis, but theyshould be used only by patients under a doctor’s care.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1905Keratitis\nClose-up of a damaged cornea due to complications follow-\ning cataract surgery.

Topical corticosteroids can cause great harmto the cornea in patients with herpes simplex keratitis.\nA patient with keratitis may wear a patch to protect\nthe healing eye from bright light, foreign objects, the lidrubbing against the cornea, and other irritants. Some-times a patch can make it worse, so again, the patientmust discuss with the doctor whether or not a patch isnecessary. The patient will probably return every day tothe eye doctor to check on the progress.\nAlthough early detection and treatment can cure\nmost forms of keratitis, the infection can cause:\n• glaucoma• permanent scarring• ulceration of the cornea• blindness\nPrevention\nChildren and adults who wear contact lenses should\nalways use sterile lens-cleaning and disinfecting solutions.Tap water is not sterile and should not be used to cleancontact lenses. It is important to go for follow-up checkupsbecause small defects in the cornea can occur without thepatient being aware of it. Do not overwear contact lenses.Remove them if the eyes become red or irritated. Replacecontact lenses when scheduled to do so. Proteins and othermatter can deposit on the contacts, leading to an increasedrisk of infection. Rinse contact lens cases in hot waterevery night, if possible, and let them air dry.

    "content": "Keratosis pilaris\nDefinition\nKeratosis pilaris is a common skin condition that\nlooks like small goose bumps, which are actually deadskin cells that build up around the hair follicle.\nDescription\nKeratosis pilaris is a disorder that occurs around the\nhair follicles of the upper arms, thighs, and sometimesthe buttocks. It presents as small, benign bumps orpapules that are actually waxy build-ups of keratin. Nor-mally skin sloughs off. However, around the hair folliclewhere the papules form, the keratinized skin cells sloughoff at a slower rate, clogging the follicles.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1906Keratosis pilarisThis is generally thought to be a genetic disorder,\nalthough the symptoms of keratosis pilaris are often seenwith ichthyosis and allergic dermatitis . It can also be\nobserved in people of all ages who have either inherited it,have a vitamin A deficiency or have dry skin. Keratosis\npilaris is a self-limiting disorder that disappears as the per-son ages. It can become more severe when conditions aredry such as during the winter months or in dry climates.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe specific causes of this disorder are unknown.\nSince this disorder runs in families, it is thought to behereditary. Keratosis pilaris is not a serious disorder andis not contagious.\nThe symptoms of keratosis pilaris are based on the\ndevelopment of small white papules the size of a grain ofsand on the upper arms, thighs, and occasionally the but-tocks and face. The papules occur around a hair follicleand are firm and white. They feel a little like coarse sand-paper, but they are not painful and there usually is noitching associated with them. They are easily removed\nand the material inside the papule usually contains asmall, coiled hair.\nDiagnosis\nA dermatologist or a general practicioner can easily\ndiagnose this disorder. A physical examination is all\nthat is necessary to diagnose keratosis pilaris. Specialtests are not needed.\nTreatment\nTo treat keratosis pilaris patients can try several strate-\ngies to lessen the bumps. First, the patient can supplementthe natural removal of dry skin and papules by using aloofah or another type of scrub when showering or bathing.A variety of different over-the-counter (OTC) lotions, oint-ments, and creams can also be applied after showeringwhile the skin is still moist and then several times a day tokeep the area moist. Medicated lotions with urea, 15%alphahydroxy acids, or Retin A can also be prescribed bythe dermatologist and applied one to two times daily. Sys-temic (oral) medications are not prescribed for keratosispilaris. However if papules are opened and become infect-ed,antibiotics may be necessary to treat the infection.\nPrognosis\nUnfortunately, the treatment for keratosis pilaris is\noften disappointing. Although extreme cases of keratosispilaris can occasionally be unsightly, the disorder is notlife threatening and usually begins to disappear as thepatient ages.KEY TERMS\nBenign —Not cancerous.\nDermatologist —A physician that specializes in\ndiseases and disorders of the skin.\nIchthyosis —A group of congenital disorders of\nkeratinization characterized by dryness and scal-ing of the skin.\nKeratin —The hard, waxy material that is made by\nthe outer layer of skin cells.\nPrevention\nSince keratosis pilaris is thought to be a genetic dis-\norder and is observed in several members of the samefamily, there is nothing that can be done to prevent thisdisorder. Following the treatment advice above can alle-viate the outward characteristics of keratosis pilaris.\nSally C. McFarlane-Parrott"

    "title": "Kidney biopsy",
    "content": "Kidney biopsy\nDefinition\nKidney biopsy is a medical procedure in which a\nsmall piece of tissue is removed from the kidney formicroscopic examination.\nPurpose\nThe test is usually done to diagnose kidney disease\nand to evaluate the extent of damage to the kidney. Abiopsy is also frequently ordered to detect the reason foracute renal failure when normal office procedures andtests fail to establish the cause. In addition, informationregarding the progression of the disease and how it isresponding to medical treatment can be obtained from abiopsy. Occasionally a biopsy may be done to confirm adiagnosis of kidney cancer , to determine its aggressive-\nness, and decide on the mode of treatment.\nPrecautions\nThe biopsy is not recommended for patients who\nhave any uncontrollable bleeding disorders. Platelets areblood cells that play an important role in the blood clot-ting process. If the bleeding disorder is caused by a low\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1907Kidney biopsyplatelet count (less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter of\nblood), then a platelet transfusion can be done just\nbefore performing the biopsy.\nDescription\nThe kidneys, a pair of organs that are shaped like\nbeans, lie on either side of the backbone, just above thewaist. The periphery (parenchyma) of the kidney is madeup of tiny tubes. These tubes filter and clean the blood bytaking out the waste products and making urine. The urineis collected in the central portion of the kidney. Tubescalled ureters drain the urine from the kidney into thebladder, where it is held until it is voided from the body.\nA kidney specialist (nephrologist) performs the\nbiopsy. It can be done either in the doctor’s office or in alocal hospital. The patient may be given a calming drugbefore the procedure to help him relax. The skin andmuscles on the back overlying the site that is to be biop-sied may be numbed with local anesthesia.\nThe patient will be asked to lie face down and a pad\nor a rolled towel may be placed under the stomach.Either the left or the right kidney may be biopsieddepending on the results of the imaging tests: x rays,computed tomography scans (CT scans), magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. The area that\nwill be biopsied is cleaned with an antiseptic solutionand sterile drapes are placed on it. The skin is numbedwith local anesthesia. A small incision is made on theskin with a scalpel blade. Using a long needle, the physi-cian injects local anesthesia into the incision so that itinfiltrates down to the kidney. The biopsy needle is thenadvanced slowly through the incision. The patient isasked to hold his or her breath each time the needle ispushed forward. Once the wall (capsule) of the kidneyhas been penetrated, the patient can breathe normally.The tissue is collected for examination and the needle iswithdrawn. The needle may be re-inserted into anotherpart of the kidney so that tissue is collected from at leastthree different areas. The tissue samples are sent to thelaboratory for examination. The entire procedure maylast about an hour.\nPreparation\nBefore performing the biopsy, the doctor should be\nmade aware of all the medications that the patient is tak-ing. The doctor should also be told whether the patient isallergic to any medications. The procedure and the risksof the procedure are explained to the patient and the nec-essary consent forms are obtained. The patient should betold that a kidney biopsy requires a 24-hour stay in thehospital after the biopsy.Some doctors order blood tests to check for clotting\nproblems before performing the biopsy. The patient’sblood type may also be determined in case a transfusionbecomes necessary.\nAftercare\nImmediately after the biopsy, pulse, respiration, and\ntemperature (vital signs) are measured. If they are stable,the patient is instructed to lie flat in bed for at least 12hours. The pulse and blood pressure are checked at regu-lar intervals by the nursing staff. All urine voided by thepatient in the first 12-24 hours is examined in the labora-tory for blood cells.\nIf bleeding is severe, iron levels in the blood drop\nsignificantly, or the patient complains of severe pain at\nthe biopsy site, the physician should be contacted imme-diately. After the patient goes home, he should avoidheavy lifting, vigorous exercise , and contact sports for at\nleast one or two weeks.\nRisks\nThe risks of a kidney biopsy are very small. Severe\nbleeding may occur after the procedure. There is also aslight chance that an infection or a lump of blood underthe skin that looks black and blue (hematoma) maydevelop. In most cases, the hematoma disappears byitself and does not cause any pain. However, severe painor a drop in blood pressure and iron levels in the bloodindicates that the hematoma is expanding. This conditioncould lead to complications and should be reportedimmediately to the doctor.\nVery rarely, the patient may develop high blood\npressure ( hypertension ), and the bleeding may be severe\nenough to require a transfusion. In extremely rare cir-cumstances, the kidney may rupture, or the surroundingorgans (pancreas, bowel, spleen, and liver) may be punc-tured. Death occurs in about one in 3000 cases.\nNormal results\nThe results are normal if no abnormalities can be\nseen in the tissue samples with the naked eye, with anelectron microscope or through staining with a fluores-cent dye (immunofluorescence).\nAbnormal results\nAny abnormalities in the size, color, and consistency\nof the sample will be reported as an abnormal result. Inaddition, any change in the structure of the renal tubules,the presence of red blood cells, or abnormalities in thecells are considered an abnormal result.

Renal cell carcinoma, which occurs in the\ncells lining the kidneys (epithelial cells), is the mostcommon type of kidney cancer. Eighty-five percent of allkidney tumors are renal cell carcinomas. Wilms’ tumor\nis a rapidly developing cancer of the kidney most oftenfound in children under four years of age.\nDescription\nThe kidneys are a pair of organs shaped like kidney\nbeans that lie on either side of the spine just above thewaist. Inside each kidney are tiny tubes (tubules) that fil-ter and clean the blood, taking out the waste products andmaking urine. The urine that is made by the kidney pass-es through a tube called the ureter into the bladder. Urineis held in the bladder until it is discharged from the body.Renal cell carcinoma generally develops in the lining ofthe tubules that filter and clean the blood. Cancer thatdevelops in the central portion of the kidney (where theurine is collected and drained into the ureters) is knownas transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis. Transitionalcell cancer is similar to bladder cancer .\nKidney cancer accounts for 3% of all cancers.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, approximate-ly 30,000 new cases of kidney cancer will be found in1998. Kidney cancer occurs most often in people between50 and 60 years old. Men are twice as likely as women tohave cancer of the kidney. Other risk factors for the devel-opment of kidney cancer include Hispanic heritage, andpre-existing von Hippel-Lindau disease.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe causes of kidney cancer are unknown, but men\nseem to have twice the risk of contracting the disease.There is a strong association between cigarette smoking\nand kidney cancer. Cigarette smokers are twice as likelyas non-smokers to develop kidney cancer. Workingaround coke ovens has been shown to increase people’srisk of developing this cancer. Certain types of painkillersthat contain the chemical phenacetin are associated withkidney cancer. The United States government discontin-ued use of analgesics containing phenacetin about 20\nyears ago. Obesity may be yet another risk factor for kid-\nney cancer. Some studies show a loose associationbetween kidney cancer and occupational exposure to cad-mium, petroleum products, lead, and asbestos.\nThe most common symptom of kidney cancer is\nblood in the urine (hematuria). Other symptoms includepainful urination, pain in the lower back or on the sides,\nabdominal pain, a lump or hard mass that can be felt inthe kidney area, unexplained weight loss, fever , weak-\nness, fatigue , and high blood pressure.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1909Kidney cancerOther symptoms may occur if the cancer has spread\nbeyond its original location. Spread of kidney cancermost commonly occurs to the lung (55%), liver (33%),bone (33%), adrenal (20%), and opposite kidney (10%).Lymph node spread is also common, occurring in about25% of patients.\nDiagnosis\nA diagnostic examination for kidney cancer includes\ntaking a thorough medical history and making a completephysical examination in which the doctor will probe\n(palpate) the abdomen for lumps. Blood tests will beordered to check for changes in blood chemistry causedby substances released by the tumor. Laboratory testsmay show abnormal levels of iron in the blood. Either alow red blood cell count (anemia) or a high red blood cellcount (erythrocytosis) may accompany kidney cancer.Occasionally, patients will have high calcium levels.\nIf the doctor suspects kidney cancer, an intravenous\npyelogram (IVP) may be ordered. An IVP is an x-ray testin which a dye in injected into a vein in the arm. The dyetravels through the body, and when it is concentrated inthe urine to be discharged, it outlines the kidneys,ureters, and the urinary bladder. On an x-ray image, thedye will reveal any abnormalities of the urinary tract.The IVP may miss small kidney cancers.\nRenal ultrasound is a diagnostic test in which sound\nwaves are used to form an image of the kidneys. Ultra-sound is a painless and non-invasive procedure that canbe used to detect even very small kidney tumors. Imag-ing tests such as computed tomography scans (CT\nscans) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be\nused to evaluate the kidneys and the surrounding organs.These tests are used to check whether the tumor hasspread outside the kidney to other organs in theabdomen. If the patient complains of bone pain, a specialx ray called a bone scan may be ordered to rule out\nspread to the bones. A chest x ray may be taken to rule\nout spread to the lungs.\nA kidney biopsy is used to positively confirm the\ndiagnosis of kidney cancer. During this procedure, a smallpiece of tissue is removed from the tumor and examinedunder a microscope. The biopsy will give informationabout the type of tumor, the cells that are involved, andthe aggressiveness of the tumor (tumor stage).\nTreatment\nEach person’s treatment is different and depends on\nseveral factors. The location, size, and extent of thetumor have to be considered in addition to the patient’sage, general health, and medical history.\nThe primary treatment for kidney cancer that has not\nspread to other parts of the body is surgical removal of thediseased kidney ( nephrectomy ). Because most cancers\naffect only one kidney, the patient can function well on theone remaining. Two types of surgical procedure are used.Radical nephrectomy removes the entire kidney and thesurrounding tissue. Sometimes, the lymph nodes sur-rounding the kidney are also removed. Partial nephrecto-my removes only part of the kidney along with the tumor.This procedure is used either when the tumor is very smallor when it is not practical to remove the entire kidney. It isnot practical to remove a kidney when the patient has onlyone kidney or when both kidneys have tumors. There is asmall (5%) chance of missing some of the cancer.\nRadiation therapy , which consists of exposing the\ncancer cells to high-energy gamma rays from an externalsource, generally destroys cancer cells with minimal dam-age to the normal tissue. Side effects are nausea, tiredness,and stomach upsets. These symptoms disappear when thetreatment is over. In kidney cancer, radiation therapy hasbeen shown to alleviate pain and bleeding, especiallywhen the cancer is inoperable. However, it has not provento be of much use in destroying the kidney cancer cells.Therefore radiation therapy is not used very often.\nTreatment of kidney cancer with anti-cancer drugs\n(chemotherapy ) has not produced good results. Howev-\ner, new drugs and new combinations of drugs continue tobe tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy, a form of treatment in which the\nbody’s immune system is harnessed to help fight the can-cer, is a new mode of therapy that is being tested for kid-ney cancer. Clinical trials with substances produced bythe immune cells (interferon, interleukin-2, and lym-phokine-activated cells) have shown some promise indestroying kidney cancer cells. These substances havebeen approved for use but they can be very toxic and pro-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1910Kidney cancer\nAn extracted cancerous kidney.

The benefits derived from the\ntreatment have to be weighed very carefully against theside effects in each case.\nA procedure called renal artery embolization may be\nused to help decrease the patient’s symptoms. In this pro-cedure, the blood flow to the affected kidney is blocked,reducing the amount of blood received by the tumor. Thisstarves the tumor, and may cause it to shrink.\nPrognosis\nBecause kidney cancer is often caught early and\nsometimes progresses slowly, the chances of a surgicalcure are good. Length of survival depends on the size ofthe original tumor, the aggressiveness of the specificcells making up the tumor, and whether the cancer cellsspread from the kidney to surrounding or distant tissues.\nKidney cancer is also one of the few cancers for\nwhich there are well-documented cases of spontaneousremission without therapy. Unfortunately, recurrencescan occur even as long as 10 years after the original diag-nosis and treatment, and cancer can also crop up in theother, previously unaffected kidney.\nPrevention\nThe exact cause of kidney cancer is not known, so it\nis not possible to prevent all cases.

    "title": "Kidney function tests",
    "content": "Kidney function tests\nDefinition\nKidney function tests is a collective term for a vari-\nety of individual tests and procedures that can be done toevaluate how well the kidneys are functioning.\nPurpose\nThe kidneys, the body’s natural filtration system, per-\nform many vital functions, including removing metabolicwaste products from the bloodstream, regulating the body’swater balance, and maintaining the pH (acidity/alkalinity)of the body’s fluids. Approximately one and a half quarts ofblood per minute are circulated through the kidneys, wherewaste chemicals are filtered out and eliminated from thebody (along with excess water) in the form of urine. Kid-ney function tests help to determine if the kidneys are per-forming their tasks adequately.\nPrecautions\nA complete history should be taken prior to kidney\nfunction tests to assess the patient’s food and drug intake.A wide variety of prescription and over-the-counter med-ications can affect blood and urine kidney function testresults, as can some food and beverages.\nDescription\nMany conditions can affect the ability of the kidneys\nto carry out their vital functions. Some lead to a rapid(acute) decline in kidney function; others lead to a grad-ual (chronic) decline in function. Both result in a build-upof toxic waste substances in the blood. A number of clini-cal laboratory tests that measure the levels of substancesnormally regulated by the kidneys can help determine thecause and extent of kidney dysfunction. These tests aredone on urine samples, as well as on blood samples.\nUrine tests\nThere are a variety of urine tests that assess kidney\nfunction. A simple, inexpensive screening test, called aroutine urinalysis , is often the first test administered if\nkidney problems are suspected. A small, randomly col-lected urine sample is examined physically for thingslike color, odor, appearance, and concentration (specif-ic gravity); chemically for substances such as protein,glucose, and pH (acidity/ alkalinity); and microscopi-cally for the presence of cellular elements (red bloodcells, white blood cells, and epithelial cells), bacteria,crystals, and casts (structures formed by the deposit ofprotein, cells, and other substances in the kidneys’tubules). If results indicate a possibility of disease orimpaired kidney function, one or more of the followingadditional tests is usually performed to more specifi-cally diagnose the cause and the level of decline in kid-ney function.\n• Creatinine clearance test. This test evaluates how\nefficiently the kidneys clear a substance called crea-tinine from the blood. Creatinine, a waste product ofmuscle energy metabolism, is produced at a constantrate that is proportional to the muscle mass of theindividual. Because the body does not recycle it, allof the creatinine filtered by the kidneys in a givenamount of time is excreted in the urine, making crea-tinine clearance a very specific measurement of kid-ney function.The test is performed on a timed urinespecimen—a cumulative sample collected over a twoto 24-hour period. Determination of the blood creati-nine level is also required to calculate the urineclearance.\n• Urea clearance test. Urea is a waste product that is cre-\nated by protein metabolism and excreted in the urine.The urea clearance test requires a blood sample to mea-sure the amount of urea in the bloodstream and twourine specimens, collected one hour apart, to determinethe amount of urea that is filtered, or cleared, by thekidneys into the urine.\n• Urine osmolality test. Urine osmolality is a measure-\nment of the number of dissolved particles in urine. It is amore precise measurement than specific gravity forevaluating the ability of the kidneys to concentrate ordilute the urine. Kidneys that are functioning normallywill excrete more water into the urine as fluid intake isincreased, diluting the urine. If fluid intake is decreased,the kidneys excrete less water and the urine becomesmore concentrated. The test may be done on a urinesample collected first thing in the morning, on multipletimed samples, or on a cumulative sample collected overa 24-hour period. The patient will typically be pre-scribed a high-protein diet for several days before thetest and asked to drink no fluids the night before the test.\n• Urine protein test. Healthy kidneys filter all proteins\nfrom the bloodstream and then reabsorb them, allowing\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1912Kidney function testsno protein, or only slight amounts of protein, into the\nurine. The persistent presence of significant amounts ofprotein in the urine, then, is an important indicator ofkidney disease. A positive screening test for protein(included in a routine urinalysis) on a random urinesample is usually followed up with a test on a 24-hoururine sample that more precisely measures the quantityof protein.\nBlood tests\nThere are also several blood tests that can aid in\nevaluating kidney function. These include:\n•Blood urea nitrogen test (BUN). Urea is a by-product\nof protein metabolism. This waste product is formed inthe liver, then filtered from the blood and excreted inthe urine by the kidneys. The BUN test measures theamount of nitrogen contained in the urea. High BUNlevels can indicate kidney dysfunction, but becauseblood urea nitrogen is also affected by protein intakeand liver function, the test is usually done in conjunc-tion with a blood creatinine, a more specific indicatorof kidney function.\n• Creatinine test. This test measures blood levels of\ncreatinine, a by-product of muscle energy metabolismthat, like urea, is filtered from the blood by the kid-neys and excreted into the urine. Production of creati-nine depends on an individual’s muscle mass, whichusually fluctuates very little. With normal kidneyfunction, then, the amount of creatinine in the bloodremains relatively constant and normal. For this rea-son, and because creatinine is affected very little byliver function, an elevated blood creatinine is a moresensitive indication of impaired kidney function thanthe BUN.\n• Other blood tests. Measurement of the blood levels of\nother elements regulated in part by the kidneys can alsobe useful in evaluating kidney function. These includesodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium,magnesium, phosphorus, protein, uric acid, and glucose.\nPreparation\nPatients will be given specific instructions for col-\nlection of urine samples, depending on the test to be per-formed. Some timed urine tests require an extended col-lection period of up to 24 hours, during which time thepatient collects all urine voided and transfers it to a spec-imen container. Refrigeration and/or preservatives aretypically required to maintain the integrity of such urinespecimens. Certain dietary and/or medication restrictionsmay be imposed for some of the blood and urine tests.The patient may also be instructed to avoid exercise for a\nperiod of time before a test.Aftercare\nIf medication was discontinued prior to a urine kidney\nfunction test, it may be resumed once the test is completed.\nRisks\nRisks for these tests are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from a blood-drawing site, hematoma(accumulation of blood under a puncture site), or faint-\ningor feeling light-headed after venipuncture. In addi-\ntion, suspension of medication or dietary changesimposed in preparation for some blood or urine tests maytrigger side-effects in some individuals.\nNormal results\nNormal values for many tests are determined by the\npatient’s age and sex. Reference values can also vary bylaboratory, but are generally within the ranges that follow.\nUrine tests\n• Creatinine clearance. For a 24-hour urine collection,\nnormal results are 90-139 ml/min for adult males lessthan 40 years old, and 80-125 ml/min for adult femalesless than 40 years old. For people over 40, valuesdecrease by 6.5 ml/min for each decade of life.\n• Urea clearance. With maximum clearance, normal is\n64-99 ml/min.\n• Urine osmolality. With restricted fluid intake (concen-\ntration testing), osmolality should be greater than 800mOsm/kg of water. With increased fluid intake (dilu-tion testing), osmolality should be less than 100mOSm/kg in at least one of the specimens collected.\n• Urine protein. A 24-hour urine collection should con-\ntain no more than 150 mg of protein.\nBlood tests\n• blood urea nitrogen (BUN). 8-20 mg/dl\n• creatinine. 0.8-1.2 mg/dl for males, and 0.6-0.9 mg/dl\nfor females\nAbnormal results\nLow clearance values for creatinine and urea indi-\ncate diminished ability of the kidneys to filter thesewaste products from the blood and excrete them in theurine. As clearance levels decrease, blood levels of crea-tinine and urea nitrogen increase. Since it can be affectedby other factors, an elevated BUN, by itself, is sugges-tive, but not diagnostic, for kidney dysfunction. Anabnormally elevated blood creatinine, a more specific\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1913Kidney function testsand sensitive indicator of kidney disease than the BUN,\nis diagnostic of impaired kidney function.\nInability of the kidneys to concentrate the urine in\nresponse to restricted fluid intake, or to dilute the urine inresponse to increased fluid intake during osmolality test-ing may indicate decreased kidney function. Because thekidneys normally excrete almost no protein in the urine,its persistent presence, in amounts that exceed the nor-mal 24-hour urine value, usually indicates some type ofkidney disease as well.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBock, G.

The images obtained can help in thediagnosis and treatment of certain kidney diseases.\nPurpose\nWhile many tests, such as x rays, ultrasound exams,\nor computed tomography scans (CT scans), can reveal\nthe structure of the kidneys (its anatomy), the kidneynuclear medicine scan is unique in that it reveals howthe kidneys are functioning. This is valuable informationin helping a doctor make a diagnosis. Therefore, the kid-ney nuclear medicine scan is performed primarily to seehow well the kidneys are working and, at the same time,can identify some of the various structures that make upthe kidney.\nPrecautions\nIf a patient is pregnant, it is generally recommended\nthat she not have a kidney nuclear medicine scan. Theunborn baby is more sensitive to radiation than an adult.If a woman thinks she might be pregnant, she shouldinform her doctor of this too.\nWomen who are breastfeeding should also inform\ntheir doctor. The doctor may recommend the woman stopbreastfeeding for a day or two after a kidney nuclearmedicine scan, depending on the particular tracer thatwas used since the tracer can accumulate in breast milk.\nDescription\nNuclear medicine is a branch of radiology that uses\nradioactive materials to diagnose or treat various dis-eases. These radioactive materials (tracers) may also becalled radiopharmaceuticals, and they accumulate (col-lect) in specific organs in the body. Radiopharmaceuti-cals are able to yield valuable information about the par-ticular organ being studied.\nWhether outside the body or inside the body, tracers\nemit radioactive signals, called gamma rays, which canbe collected and counted by a special device, called agamma camera. The images of the kidney that the cam-era produces are called renal scans.\nThe kidney nuclear medicine scan can be performed\non an outpatient basis, usually by a nuclear medicine\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1914Kidney nuclear medicine scantechnologist. The technologist helps prepare the patient\nfor the exam by positioning him or her on an exam tableor cart in the imaging area. The patient’s position is usual-ly flat on the back. The patient must lie still during imag-ing to prevent blurring of the images that will be taken.The technologist positions the camera as close to the kid-ney (or kidneys) as possible to obtain the best images.\nIn the next step of the procedure, the technologist\ninjects the radiopharmaceutical into the patient. Thismay be done with one single injection or through anintravenous (IV) line. Immediately after the tracer isinjected, imaging begins. It is important to obtainimages right away because the tracer’s radioactivitybegins to diminish (decay). The time required for one-half of the tracer’s activity to decay is called the tracer’shalf-life (T 1/2). The half-life is unique to each radio-pharmaceutical. Also, it is important to see the kidney inits immediate state.\nSerial pictures are taken with the gamma camera and\nmay be seen on a computer or TV-like screen. The cam-era doesn’t emit radiation, it only records it. The imagesthen are stored on film.\nA kidney nuclear medicine scan ranges from 45\nminutes to three hours in length, depending on the goalsof the test. But the test typically takes about an hour to anhour-and-a-half.\nOnce the images and curves are obtained, the\nnuclear medicine physician or radiologist analyzes, orreads, them. Various information can be provided to thedoctor through these, depending on the test that was per-formed. A variety of kidney nuclear medicine studies areavailable for a doctor to help in making diagnoses. It is\nimportant to understand that kidney nuclear medicinescans are good at identifying when there is an abnormali-ty, but they do not always identify the specific problem.They are very useful in providing information about howthe various parts of the kidneys function, which, in turn,can assist in making a diagnosis.\nStudies may be performed to determine the rate at\nwhich the kidneys are filtering a patient’s blood. Thesestudies use a radiopharmaceutical, called TechnetiumDTPA (Tc 99m DTPA). This radiopharmaceutical alsocan identify obstruction (blockage) in the collecting sys-tem. To study how well the tubules and ducts of the kid-ney are functioning, the radiopharmaceutical TechnetiumMAG3 is used. Studying tubular function is a good indi-cator of overall renal function. In many renal diseases,one of the first things that disappears or diminishes is thetubular function.\nCandidates for a kidney nuclear medicine scan are\npatients who have:\n• renal failure or chronic renal failure\n• obstruction in their urine collection systems•renal artery stenosis\n• a kidney transplant\nPreparation\nNo preparation is necessary for a kidney nuclear\nmedicine scan. The doctor may ask the patient to refrainfrom certain medications, however, before the scan if themedications might interfere with the test. For example, if\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1915Kidney nuclear medicine scan\nA computer-generated time activity curve generated from a renal scan.This time activity curve looks at the radiation count\nover a period of time. (Photograph by Collette Placek. Reproduced by permission.)a scan is being performed to study renal artery stenosis,\nthe patient may have to refrain from taking medicationsfor hypertension .\nAftercare\nPatients can resume their normal daily activities\nimmediately after the test. Most tracers are passed natu-rally from the body, though drinking fluids after a kidneynuclear medicine scan can help flush the tracer into theurine and out of the body more quickly.\nRisks\nNuclear medicine procedures are very safe. Unlike\nsome of the dyes that may be used in x-ray studies,radioactive tracers rarely cause side effects. There are nolong-lasting effects of the tracers themselves, becausethey have no functional effects on the body’s tissues.\nNormal results\nThe test reveals normal kidney function for age and\nmedical situation.\nAbnormal results\nThe test reveals a change in function that may be\nattributable to a disease process, such as obstruction or amalfunctioning kidney. If the test is abnormal, the patientmay be recalled another day for a repeat study, per-formed differently, to narrow the list of causes.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHenkin, Robert, et al. Nuclear Medicine.

    "title": "Kidney stones",
    "content": "Kidney stones\nDefinition\nKidney stones are solid accumulations of material\nthat form in the tubal system of the kidney. Kidneystones cause problems when they block the flow of urinethrough or out of the kidney. When the stones movealong the ureter, they cause severe pain .\nDescription\nUrine is formed by the kidneys. Blood flows into the\nkidneys, and specialized tubes (nephrons) within the kid-neys allow a certain amount of fluid from the blood, andcertain substances dissolved in that fluid, to flow out ofthe body as urine. Sometimes, a problem causes the dis-solved substances to become solid again. Tiny crystalsmay form in the urine, meet, and cling together to createa larger solid mass called a kidney stone.\nMany people do not ever find out that they have\nstones in their kidneys. These stones are small enough toallow the kidney to continue functioning normally, nevercausing any pain. These are called “silent stones.” Kidneystones cause problems when they interfere with the nor-mal flow of urine. They can block (obstruct) the flowdown the tube (the ureter) that carries urine from the kid-ney to the bladder. The kidney is not accustomed to expe-riencing any pressure. When pressure builds from backed-up urine, the kidney may swell ( hydronephrosis ). If the\nkidney is subjected to this pressure for some time, it maycause damage to the delicate kidney structures. When thekidney stone is lodged further down the ureter, thebacked-up urine may also cause the ureter to swell(hydroureter). Because the ureters are muscular tubes, the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1916Kidney stonespresence of a stone will make these muscular tubes\nspasm, causing severe pain.\nAbout 10% of all people will have a kidney stone in\nhis or her lifetime. Kidney stones are most commonamong:\n• caucasians• males• people over the age of 30• people who have had kidney stones previously• relatives of kidney stone patients\nCauses and symptoms\nKidney stones can be composed of a variety of sub-\nstances. The most common types of kidney stones include:\n• Calcium stones. About 80% of all kidney stones fall into\nthis category. These stones are composed of either calci-um and phosphate, or calcium and oxalate. People withcalcium stones may have other diseases that cause themto have increased blood levels of calcium. These diseasesinclude primary parathyroidism, sarcoidosis ,hyperthy-\nroidism ,renal tubular acidosis ,multiple myeloma ,\nhyperoxaluria, and some types of cancer . A diet heavy in\nmeat, fish, and poultry can cause calcium oxalate stones.\n• Struvite stones. About 10% of all kidney stones fall into\nthis category. This type of stone is composed of magne-sium ammonium phosphate. These stones occur mostoften when patients have had repeated urinary tractinfections with certain types of bacteria. These bacteriaproduce a substance called urease, which increases theurine pH and makes the urine more alkaline and lessacidic. This chemical environment allows struvite tosettle out of the urine, forming stones.\n• Uric acid stones. About 5% of all kidney stones fall into\nthis category. Uric acid stones occur when increasedamounts of uric acid circulate in the bloodstream.When the uric acid content becomes very high, it canno longer remain dissolved and solid bits of uric acidsettle out of the urine. A kidney stone is formed whenthese bits of uric acid begin to cling to each other with-in the kidney, slowly growing into a solid mass. Abouthalf of all patients with this type of stone also havedeposits of uric acid elsewhere in their body, commonlyin the joint of the big toe. This painful disorder is calledgout . Other causes of uric acid stones include\nchemotherapy for cancer, certain bone marrow disor-\nders where blood cells are over-produced, and an inher-ited disorder called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome .\n• Cystine stones. About 2% of all kidney stones fall into\nthis category. Cystine is a type of amino acid, and peo-ple with this type of kidney stone have an abnormality\nin the way their bodies process amino acids in the diet.\nPatients who have kidney stones usually do not have\nsymptoms until the stones pass into the ureter. Prior tothis, some people may notice blood in their urine. Oncethe stone is in the ureter, however, most people will expe-rience bouts of very severe pain. The pain is crampy andspasmodic, and is referred to as “colic”. The pain usuallybegins in the flank region, the area between the lowerribs and the hip bone. As the stone moves closer to thebladder, a patient will often feel the pain radiating alongthe inner thigh. In women, the pain may be felt in thevulva. In men, the pain may be felt in the testicles. Nau-sea, vomiting, extremely frequent and painful urination,and obvious blood in the urine are common. Fever and\nchills usually means that the ureter has become obstruct-ed, allowing bacteria to become trapped in the kidneycausing a kidney infection ( pyelonephritis ).\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosing kidney stones is based on the patient’s\nhistory of the very severe, distinctive pain associated withthe stones. Diagnosis includes laboratory examination ofa urine sample and an x-ray examination. During the pas-sage of a stone, examination of the urine almost alwaysreveals blood. A number of x-ray tests are used to diag-nose kidney stones. A plain x ray of the kidneys, ureters,and bladder may or may not reveal the stone. A series of xrays taken after injecting iodine dye into a vein is usuallya more reliable way of seeing a stone. This procedure iscalled an intravenous pyelogram (IVP). The dye “lightsup” the urinary system as it travels. In the case of anobstruction, the dye will be stopped by the stone or willonly be able to get past the stone at a slow trickle.\nWhen a patient is passing a kidney stone, it is impor-\ntant that all of his or her urine is strained through a spe-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1917Kidney stones\nX ray of kidney stone. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-\nduced by permission.)cial sieve. This is to make sure that the stone is caught.\nThe stone can then be sent to a special laboratory foranalysis so that the chemical composition of the stonecan be determined. After the kidney stone has beenpassed, other tests will be required in order to understandthe underlying condition that may have caused the stoneto form. Collecting urine for 24 hours, followed by care-ful analysis of its chemical makeup, can often determinea number of reasons for stone formation.\nTreatment\nA patient with a kidney stone will say that the most\nimportant aspect of treatment is adequate pain relief.Because the pain of passing a kidney stone is so severe,narcotic pain medications (like morphine) are usuallyrequired. It is believed that stones may pass more quickly\nif the patient is encouraged to drink large amounts ofwater (2-3 quarts per day). If the patient is vomiting orunable to drink because of the pain, it may be necessaryto provide fluids through a vein. If symptoms and urinetests indicate the presence of infection, antibiotics will\nbe required.\nAlthough most kidney stones will pass on their\nown, some will not. Surgical removal of a stone maybecome necessary when a stone appears too large topass. Surgery may also be required if the stone is caus-ing serious obstructions, pain that cannot be treated,heavy bleeding, or infection. Several alternatives existfor removing stones. One method involves inserting atube into the bladder and up into the ureter. A tiny bas-ket is then passed through the tube, and an attempt ismade to snare the stone and pull it out. Open surgery toremove an obstructing kidney stone was relativelycommon in the past, but current methods allow thestone to be crushed with shock waves (called lithotrip-\nsy). These shock waves may be aimed at the stone from\noutside of the body by passing the necessary equip-ment through the bladder and into the ureter. The shockwaves may be aimed at the stone from inside the bodyby placing the instrument through a tiny incision locat-ed near the stone. The stone fragments may then passon their own or may be removed through the incision.All of these methods reduce the patient’s recovery timeconsiderably when compared to the traditional openoperation.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments for kidney stones include\nthe use of herbal medicine, homeopathy ,acupunc-\nture ,acupressure , hypnosis, or guided imagery to\nrelieve pain. Starfruit ( Averrhoa carambola ) is recom-\nmended to increase the amount of urine a patient pass-es and to relieve pain. Dietary changes can be made toreduce the risk of future stone formation and to facili-tate the resorption of existing stones. Supplementationwith magnesium, a smooth muscle relaxant, can helpreduce pain and facilitate stone passing. Homeopathyand herbal medicine, both western and Chinese, rec-ommend a number of remedies that may help preventkidney stones.\nPrognosis\nA patient’s prognosis depends on the underlying dis-\norder causing the development of kidney stones. In mostcases, patients with uncomplicated calcium stones willrecover very well. About 60% of these patients, however,will have other kidney stones.

Theywill require surgical removal. Uric acid stones may alsobecome staghorn stones.\nPrevention\nPrevention of kidney stones depends on the type of\nstone and the presence of an underlying disease. Inalmost all cases, increasing fluid intake so that a personconsistently drinks several quarts of water a day is animportant preventative measure. Patients with calciumstones may benefit from taking a medication called adiuretic, which has the effect of decreasing the amountof calcium passed in the urine. Eating less meat, fish,and chicken may be helpful for patients with calciumoxalate stones. Other items in the diet that may encour-age calcium oxalate stone formation include beer, blackpepper, berries, broccoli, chocolate, spinach, and tea.Uric acid stones may require treatment with a medica-tion called allopurinol. Struvite stones will requireremoval and the patient should receive an antibiotic.When a disease is identified as the cause of stone forma-tion, treatment specific to that disease may lessen thelikelihood of repeated stones.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAsplin, John R., et al. “Nephrolithiasis.” In Harrison’s Princi-\nples of Internal Medicine , ed.

    "content": "Rosalyn Carson-DeWitt, MDKidney transplantation\nDefinition\nKidney transplantation is a surgical procedure to\nremove a healthy, functioning kidney from a living orbrain-dead donor and implant it into a patient with non-functioning kidneys.\nPurpose\nKidney transplantation is performed on patients with\nchronic kidney failure , or end-stage renal disease\n(ESRD). ESRD occurs when a disease or disorder dam-ages the kidneys so that they are no longer capable ofadequately removing fluids and wastes from the body orof maintaining the proper level of certain kidney-regulat-ed chemicals in the bloodstream. Without long-term dial-ysis or a kidney transplant, ESRD is fatal.\nPrecautions\nPatients with a history of heart disease, lung disease,\ncancer , or hepatitis may not be suitable candidates for\nreceiving a kidney transplant.\nDescription\nKidney transplantation involves surgically attaching\na functioning kidney, or graft, from a brain-dead organdonor (a cadaver transplant) or from a living donor, to apatient with ESRD. Living donors may be related orunrelated to the patient, but a related donor has a betterchance of having a kidney that is a stronger biological“match” for the patient.\nThe surgical procedure to remove a kidney from a\nliving donor is called a nephrectomy . The kidney donor is\nadministered general anesthesia and an incision is madeon the side or front of the abdomen. The blood vesselsconnecting the kidney to the donor are cut and clamped,and the ureter is also cut between the bladder and kidneyand clamped. The kidney and an attached section ofureter is removed from the donor. The vessels and ureterin the donor are then tied off and the incision is suturedtogether again. A similar procedure is used to harvestcadaver kidneys, although both kidneys are typicallyremoved at once, and blood and cell samples for tissue\ntyping are also taken.\nLaparoscopic nephrectomy is a form of minimally-\ninvasive surgery using instruments on long, narrow rodsto view, cut, and remove the donor kidney. The surgeonviews the kidney and surrounding tissue with a flexiblevideoscope. The videoscope and surgical instruments are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1919Kidney transplantationmaneuvered through four small incisions in the\nabdomen. Once the kidney is freed, it is secured in a bagand pulled through a fifth incision, approximately 3 in(7.6 cm) wide, in the front of the abdominal wall belowthe navel. Although this surgical technique takes slightlylonger than a traditional nephrectomy, preliminary stud-ies have shown that it promotes a faster recovery time,shorter hospital stays, and less post-operative pain for\nkidney donors.\nOnce removed, kidneys from live donors and cadav-\ners are placed on ice and flushed with a cold preservativesolution. The kidney can be preserved in this solution for24-48 hours until the transplant takes place. The soonerthe transplant takes place after harvesting the kidney, thebetter the chances are for proper functioning.\nDuring the transplant operation, the kidney recipient\npatient is typically under general anesthesia and adminis-tered antibiotics to prevent possible infection. A catheter\nis placed in the bladder before surgery begins. An inci-sion is made in the flank of the patient and the surgeonimplants the kidney above the pelvic bone and below theexisting, non-functioning kidney by suturing the kidneyartery and vein to the patient’s iliac artery and vein. The\nureter of the new kidney is attached directly to the blad-der of the kidney recipient. Once the new kidney isattached, the patient’s existing, diseased kidneys may ormay not be removed, depending on the circumstancessurrounding the kidney failure.\nSince 1973, Medicare has picked up 80% of ESRD\ntreatment costs, including the costs of transplantation forboth the kidney donor and recipient. Medicare also cov-ers 80% of immunosuppressive medication costs for upto three years, although federal legislation was underconsideration in early 1998 that may remove the timelimit on these benefits. To qualify for Medicare ESRDbenefits, a patient must be insured or eligible for benefitsunder Social Security, or be a spouse or child of an eligi-ble American. Private insurance and state Medicaid pro-grams often cover the remaining 20% of treatment costs.\nPreparation\nPatients with chronic renal disease who need a trans-\nplant and do not have a living donor register with UnitedNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) will be placed on a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1920Kidney transplantation\nNew kidney\nIliac vein\nIliac artery\nBladder\nKidney transplantation involves the surgical attachment of a functioning kidney, or graft, from a donor to a patient with end-\nstage renal disease (ESRD).

(Illustration by Electron-\nic Illustrators Group.)waiting list for a cadaver kidney transplant. UNOS is a\nnon-profit organization that is under contract with thefederal government to administer the Organ Procurementand Transplant Network (OPTN) and the national Scien-tific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SR). Kidneyavailability is based on the patient’s health status. Themost important factor is that the kidney be compatible tothe patient’s body. A human kidney has a set of six anti-gens, substances that stimulate the production of anti-bodies. (Antibodies then attach to cells they recognize asforeign and attack them.) Donors are tissue-matched for0 to 6 of the antigens, and compatibility is determined bythe number and strength of those matched pairs. Patientswith a living donor who is a close relative have the bestchance of a close match.\nPotential kidney donors undergo a complete medical\nhistory and physical examination to evaluate their suit-\nability for donation. Extensive blood tests are performedon both donor and recipient. The blood samples are usedto tissue type for antigen matches, and confirm thatblood types are compatible. A panel of reactive antibody(PRA) is performed by mixing white blood cells from thedonor and serum from the recipient to ensure that therecipient antibodies will not have a negative reaction to\nthe donor antigens. A urine test is performed on thedonor to evaluate his kidney function. In some cases, aspecial dye that shows up on x rays is injected into anartery, and x rays are taken to show the blood supply ofthe donor kidney (a procedure called an arteriogram).\nOnce compatibility is confirmed and the physical\npreparations for kidney transplantation are complete, bothdonor and recipient may undergo a psychological or psy-chiatric evaluation to ensure that they are emotionally pre-pared for the transplant procedure and aftercare regimen.\nAftercare\nKidney donors and recipients will experience some\ndiscomfort in the area of the incision. Pain relievers areadministered following the transplant operation. Patientsmay also experience numbness, caused by severednerves, near or on the incision.\nA regimen of immunosuppressive, or anti-rejection,\nmedication is prescribed to prevent the body’s immunesystem from rejecting the new kidney. Commonimmunosuppressants include cyclosporine, prednisone,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1921Kidney transplantation\nA human kidney is being prepped by medical personnel prior to transplantation. (Photograph by Brad Nelson, Custom Medical\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)and azathioprine. The kidney recipient will be required to\ntake immunosuppressants for the life span of the newkidney. Intravenous antibodies may also be administeredafter transplant surgery. Daclizumab, a monoclonal anti-body, is a promising new therapy that can be used in con-junction with standard immunosuppressive medicationsto reduce the incidence of organ rejection.\nTransplant recipients may need to adjust their\ndietary habits. Certain immunosuppressive medicationscause increased appetite or sodium and protein retention,and the patient may have to adjust his or her intake ofcalories, salt, and protein to compensate.\nRisks\nAs with any surgical procedure, the kidney transplan-\ntation procedure carries some risk for both a living donorand a graft recipient. Possible complications includeinfection and bleeding (hemorrhage). The most commoncomplication for kidney recipients is a urine leak. Inapproximately 5% of kidney transplants, the ureter sufferssome damage, which results in the leak. This problem isusually correctable with follow-up surgery.\nThe biggest risk to the recovering transplant recipi-\nent is not from the operation or the kidney itself, but fromthe immunosuppressive medication he or she must take.Because these drugs suppress the immune system, thepatient is susceptible to infections such as cytomegalo-virus (CMV) and varicella ( chickenpox ). The immuno-\nsuppressants can also cause a host of possible sideeffects, from high blood pressure to osteoporosis . Pre-\nscription and dosage adjustments can lessen side effectsfor some patients.\nNormal results\nThe new kidney may start functioning immediately,\nor may take several weeks to begin producing urine. Liv-ing donor kidneys are more likely to begin functioningearlier than cadaver kidneys, which frequently suffersome reversible damage during the kidney transplant and\nstorage procedure. Patients may have to undergo dialysisfor several weeks while their new kidney establishes anacceptable level of functioning.\nThe success of a kidney transplant graft depends on\nthe strength of the match between donor and recipientand the source of the kidney. Cadaver kidneys have afour-year survival rate of 66%, compared to an 80.9%survival rate for living donor kidneys. However, therehave been cases of cadaver and living, related donor kid-neys functioning well for over 25 years.\nStudies have shown that after they recover from\nsurgery, kidney donors typically have no long-term com-plications from the loss of one kidney, and their remain-ing kidney will increase its functioning to compensatefor the loss of the other.\nAbnormal results\nA transplanted kidney may be rejected by the\npatient. Rejection occurs when the patient’s immune sys-tem recognizes the new kidney as a foreign body andattacks the kidney. It may occur soon after transplanta-tion, or several months or years after the procedure hastaken place. Rejection episodes are not uncommon in thefirst weeks after transplantation surgery, and are treatedwith high-dose injections of immunosuppressant\ndrugs . If a rejection episode cannot be reversed and kid-\nney failure continues, the patient will typically go backon dialysis. Another transplant procedure can be attempt-ed at a later date if another kidney becomes available.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrenner, Barry M., and Floyd C. Rector Jr., eds. The Kidney.\nPhiladelphia: W.

    "content": "Kinesiology, applied\nDefinition\nKinesiology is a series of tests that locate weakness-\nes in specific muscles reflecting imbalances throughoutthe body. Then specific massages or acupressure tech-\nniques are used in an attempt to rebalance what has beenrevealed by the kinesiology tests. Thus, kinesiology isused as both an assessment tool and as a limited thera-peutic modality.\nPurpose\nKinesiology claims to be a healing system that\ndetects and corrects imbalances in the body before theydevelop into a disease, and which restores overall systembalance and harmony. It is used to alleviate muscle, bone,and joint problems, treat all manner of aches and pains,and correct many areas of imbalance and discomfort.\nPrecautions\nSince interpretation of the muscle tests is both com-\nplex and subjective, it should only be performed by alicensed health professional trained to look for “subclini-cal” symptoms (those which have not yet become amajor problem). Kinesiology itself is more of a diagnos-tic technique and should not be thought of as a cure forany particular problem.\nDescription\nTraditionally, the word kinesiology refers simply to\nthe study of muscles and body movement. In 1964, how-ever, American chiropractor George J. Goodheart found-ed what has become known as applied kinesiology whenhe linked oriental ideas about energy flow in the bodywith western techniques of muscle testing. First, Good-heart noted that all muscles are related to other muscles.He observed that for each movement a muscle makes,there is another muscle or group of muscles involvedwith that movement; one muscle contracts while another\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1924Kinesiology, appliedone relaxes. So when he was presented with a painful,\noverly-tight muscle, he would observe and treat theopposite, and necessarily weak, muscle to restore bal-ance. This was then a very new technique.\nFurther, Goodheart argued that there is a definite and\nreal connection between muscles, glands, and organs,and that by testing the strength of certain muscles hecould learn about the health or condition of the gland ororgan to which it was related.\nApplied kinesiology is based on the idea that the\nbody is an interacting unit made of different parts thatinterconnect and affect each other. Everything we doaffects the body as a whole; therefore, a problem in onearea can cause trouble in another area. According tokinesiology, the muscles eventually register and reflectanything that is wrong with any part of the body, whetherphysical or mental. Thus, a particular digestive problemmight show up in the related and corresponding musclesof the legs. By testing the strength of certain muscles, thekinesiologist claims to be able to gain access to thebody’s communication system, and, thus, to read thehealth status of each of the body’s major components.\nThe manual testing of muscles or muscle strength is\nnot new, and was used in the late 1940s to evaluate musclefunction and strength and to assess the extent of an injury.Applied kinesiology measures whether a muscle is stuckin the “on” position, acting like a tense muscle spasm, or isstuck “off,” appearing weak or flaccid. It is called manualtesting because it is done without instruments, using onlythe kinesiologist’s fingertip pressure. During the first andlongest appointment which lasts about an hour, the kinesi-ologist conducts a complete consultation, asking about thepatient’s history and background. During the physical\nexamination , patients sit or lie down, then the kinesiolo-\ngist holds the patient’s leg or arm to isolate a particularmuscle. The practitioner then touches a point on the bodywhich he believes is related to that muscle, and, withquick, gentle, and painless pressure, pushes down on thelimb. Patients are asked to resist this pressure, and, if theycannot, an imbalance is suspected in the related organ,gland, or body part. This diagnostic technique uses mus-cles to find the cause of a problem, and is based on tradi-\ntional Chinese medicine and its idea that the body has\ncommon energy meridians, or channels, for both organsand muscles. Kinesiologists also claim that they are able tolocate muscle weaknesses that stem from a variety ofcauses such as allergies , mineral and vitamin deficiencies,\nas well as from problems with the lymph system. Once theexact cause is determined, the kinesiologist uses his fin-gertips to work the appropriate corresponding acupressurepoints in order to rebalance the flow of energy and restorehealth. Often he will recommend a complementary pro-gram of nutrition therapy.KEY TERMS\nAcupressure —A form of acupuncture in which\ncertain points of the body are pressed with the fin-gers and hands to release energy blocks.\nAlleviate —To make something easier to be endured.\nComplementary —Something that serves to fill out\nor complete something else.\nDeficiency —A shortage of something necessary\nfor health.\nDiagnostic —The art or act of identifying a disease\nfrom its signs and symptoms.\nFlaccid —Flabby, limp, weak.\nMeridian —In traditional Chinese medicine, the\nchannels which run beneath the skin throughwhich the body’s energy flows.\nSpasm —An involuntary, sudden, violent contrac-\ntion of a muscle or a group of muscles.\nRisks\nThere are no major risks associated with this gentle,\nnoninvasive therapy.

    "title": "Klinefelter syndrome",
    "content": "Klinefelter syndrome\nDefinition\nKlinefelter syndrome is a chromosome disorder in\nmales. People with this condition are born with at leastone extra X chromosome.\nDescription\nKlinefelter syndrome is a condition where one or\nmore extra X-chromosomes are present in a male. Boyswith this condition appear normal at birth. They enterpuberty normally, but by mid puberty have low levels of\ntestosterone causing small testicles and the inability tomake sperm. Affected males may also have learning dis-abilities and behavior problems such as shyness andimmaturity and an increased risk for certain other healthproblems.\nKlinefelter syndrome is one of the most common\nchromosomal abnormalities. About 1 in every 500 to 800males is born with this disorder. Approximately 3% ofthe infertile male population have Klinefelter syndrome.\nCauses and symptoms\nChromosomes are found in the cells in the body.\nChromosomes contain genes, structures that tell the bodyhow to grow and develop. Chromosomes are responsiblefor passing on hereditary traits from parents to child.Chromosomes also determine whether the child will bemale or female. Normally, a person has a total of 46chromosomes in each cell, two of which are responsiblefor determining that individual’s sex. These two sexchromosomes are called X and Y . The combination ofthese two types of chromosomes determines the sex of achild. Females have two X chromosomes (the XX com-bination); males have one X and one Y chromosome (theXY combination).\nIn Klinefelter syndrome, a problem very early in\ndevelopment results in an abnormal number of chromo-somes. Most commonly, a male with Klinefelter syn-drome will be born with 47 chromosomes in each cell,rather than the normal number of 46. The extra chromo-some is an X chromosome. This means that rather thanhaving the normal XY combination, the male has anXXY combination. Because people with Klinefelter syn-drome have a Y chromosome, they are all male.\nApproximately 1/3 of all males with Klinefelter syn-\ndrome have other chromosome changes involving anextra X chromosome. Mosaic Klinefelter syndromeoccurs when some of the cells in the body have an extraX chromosome and the other have normal male chromo-somes. These males can have the same or milder symp-toms than non-mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. Males withmore than one additional extra X chromosome, such as48,XXXY , are usually more severely affected than maleswith 47,XXY .\nKlinefelter syndrome is not considered an inherited\ncondition. The risk of Klinefelter syndrome reoccurringin another pregnancy is not increased above the general\npopulation risk.\nThe symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome are variable\nand not every affected person will have all of the featuresof the condition. Males with Klinefelter syndromeappear normal at birth and have normal male genitalia.From childhood, males with Klinefelter syndrome aretaller than average with long limbs. Approximately20–50% have a mild intention tremor, an uncontrolledshaking. Many males with Klinefelter syndrome havepoor upper body strength and can be clumsy. Klinefeltersyndrome does not cause homosexuality. Approximately1/3 of males with Klinefelter syndrome have breastgrowth, some requiring breast reduction surgery.\nMost boys enter puberty normally, though some can\nbe delayed. The Leydig cells in the testicles usually pro-duce testosterone. With Klinefelter syndrome, the Leydigcells fail to work properly causing the testosterone pro-duction to slow. By mid-puberty, testosterone productionis decreased to approximately half of normal. This canlead to decreased facial and pubic hair growth. Thedecreased testosterone also causes an increase in twoother hormones, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) andluteinizing hormone (LH). Normally, FSH and LH helpthe immature sperm cells grow and develop. In Klinefel-ter syndrome, there are few or no sperm cells. Theincreased amount of FSH and LH cause hyalinization andfibrosis, the growth of excess fibrous tissue, in the semi-niferous tubules, where the sperm are normally located.As a result, the testicles appear smaller and firmer thannormal. With rare exception, men with Klinefelter syn-drome are infertile because they can not make sperm.\nWhile it was once believed that all boys with Kline-\nfelter syndrome were mentally retarded, doctors nowknow that the disorder can exist without retardation.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1926Klinefelter syndromeHowever, children with Klinefelter syndrome frequently\nhave difficulty with language, including learning tospeak, read, and write. Approximately 50% of maleswith Klinefelter syndrome are dyslexic.\nSome people with Klinefelter syndrome have diffi-\nculty with social skills and tend to be more shy, anxious,or immature than their peers. They can also have poorjudgement and do not handle stressful situations well. Asa result, they often do not feel comfortable in large socialgatherings. Some people with Klinefelter syndrome canalso have anxiety , nervousness and/or depression.\nThe greater the number of X-chromosomes present,\nthe greater the disability. Boys with several extra X-chro-mosomes have distinctive facial features, more severeretardation, deformities of bony structures, and evenmore disordered development of male features.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome is made by exam-\nining chromosomes for evidence of more than one Xchromosome present in a male. This can be done in preg-nancy with prenatal testing such as a chorionic villus\nsampling or amniocentesis . Chorionic villus sampling\nis a procedure done early in pregnancy (approximately10–12 weeks) to obtain a small sample of the placentafor testing. An amniocentesis is done further along inpregnancy (from approximately 16–18 weeks) to obtaina sample of fluid surrounding the baby for testing. Bothprocedures have a risk of miscarriage . Usually these\nprocedures are done for a reason other than diagnosingKlinefelter syndrome. For example, a prenatal diagnosticprocedure may be done on an older woman to determineif her baby has Down syndrome . If the diagnosis of\nKlinefelter syndrome is suspected in a young boy oradult male, chromosome testing can also be on a smallblood or skin sample after birth.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment available to change chromoso-\nmal makeup. Children with Klinefelter syndrome maybenefit from a speech therapist for speech problems orother educational intervention for learning disabilities.Testosterone injections started around the time of pubertymay help to produce more normal development includingmore muscle mass, hair growth and increased sex drive.Testosterone supplementation will not increase testicularsize, decrease breast growth or correct infertility .\nPrognosis\nWhile many men with Klinefelter syndrome go on\nto live normal lives, nearly 100% of these men will beKEY TERMS\nChromosome —A microscopic thread-like struc-\nture found within each cell of the body that con-sists of a complex of proteins and DNA.

    "content": "Kneecap removal\nDefinition\nKneecap removal, or patellectomy, is the surgical\nremoval of the patella, commonly called the kneecap.\nPurpose\nKneecap removal is done under three circumstances:\n• when the kneecap is fractured or shattered\n• when the kneecap dislocates easily and repeatedly\n• when degenerative arthritis of the kneecap causes\nextreme pain\nA person of any age can break a kneecap in an acci-\ndent. When the bone is shattered beyond repair, thekneecap is removed. No prosthesis or artificial replace-ment part is put in its place.\nDislocation of the kneecap is most common in\nyoung girls between the ages of 10-14. Initially, thekneecap will pop back into place of its own accord, butpain may continue. If dislocation occurs too often, or thekneecap doesn’t go back into place correctly, the patellamay rub the other bones in the knee, causing an arthritis-like condition. Some people are born with birth defects\nthat cause the kneecap to dislocate frequently.\nDegenerative arthritis of the kneecap, also called\npatellar arthritis or chondromalacia patellae , can cause\nenough pain that it is necessary to remove the kneecap.As techniques of joint replacement have improved,\narthritis in the knee is more frequently treated with totalknee replacement.\nPrecautions\nPeople who have had their kneecap removed for\ndegenerative arthritis and then later have to have a totalknee replacement are more likely to have problems withthe stability of their artificial knee than those who onlyhave total knee replacement. This is because therealigned muscles and tendons provide less support oncethe kneecap is removed.Description\nKneecap removal is performed under either general\nor local anesthesia at a hospital or freestanding surgicalcenter, by an orthopedic surgeon. The surgeon makes anincision around the kneecap. Then, the muscles and ten-dons attached to the kneecap are cut and the kneecap isremoved. Next, the muscles are sewed back together, andthe skin is closed with sutures or clips that stay in placeabout one week. Any hospital stay is generally brief.\nPreparation\nPrior to surgery, x rays and other diagnostic tests are\ndone on the knee to determine if removing the kneecap isthe appropriate treatment. Pre-operative blood and urinetests are also done.\nAftercare\nPain relievers may be prescribed for a few days. The\npatient will initially need to use a cane, or crutches, towalk. Physical therapy exercises to strengthen the kneeshould be begun immediately. Driving should be avoidedfor several weeks. Full recovery can take months.\nRisks\nRisks involved with kneecap removal are similar to\nthose that occur in any surgical procedure, mainly allergicreaction to anesthesia, excessive bleeding, and infection.\nNormal results\nPeople who have kneecap removal because of a bro-\nken bone or repeated dislocations have the best chancefor complete recovery. Those who have this operationbecause of arthritis may have less successful results, andlater need a total knee replacement.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Kneecap Removal.” In The Complete Guide to Symptoms, Ill-\nness and Surgery. 3rd ed.

The test, which is also called apotassium hydroxide preparation, is done to rapidly diag-nose fungal infections of the hair, skin, or nails. A sampleof the infected area is analyzed under a microscope follow-ing the addition of a few drops of potassium hydroxide.\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the KOH test is the differen-\ntial diagnosis of infections produced by dermatophytesand Candida albicans from other skin disorders. Der-\nmatophytes are a type of fungus that invade the top layerof the skin, hair, or nails, and produce an infection com-monly known as ringworm , technically known as tinea.\nIt can appear as “jock itch” in the groin or inner thighs(tinea cruris); on the feet (tinea pedis); on the scalp andhair (tinea capitis); and on the nails (tinea unguium).Tinea versicolor appears anywhere on the skin and pro-duces characteristic unpigmented patches. Tineaunguium affects the nails.\nSimilar symptoms of redness, scaling, and itching\ncan be caused by other conditions, such as eczema andpsoriasis . The KOH test is a quick, inexpensive test—\noften done in a physician’s office—to see if these symp-toms are caused by a dermatophyte. If a dermatophyte isfound, treatment is started immediately; further tests areseldom necessary.\nA yeast (candidal) infection of the skin or a mucous\nmembrane, such as the mouth, often produces a whitecheesy material at the infection site. This type of infection,known as thrush, is also identified with the KOH test.\nDescription\nThe KOH test involves the preparation of a slide for\nviewing under the laboratory microscope. KOH mixedwith a blue-black dye is added to a sample from theinfected tissues. This mixture makes it easier to see thedermatophytes or yeast under the microscope. The KOHdissolves skin cells, hair, and debris; the dye adds color.The slide is gently heated to speed up the action of theKOH. Finally the slide is examined under a microscope.\nDermatophytes are easily recognized under the\nmicroscope by their long branch-like structures. Yeastcells look round or oval. The dermatophyte that causestinea versicolor has a characteristic spaghetti-and-meat-balls appearance.KEY TERMS\nDermatophyte —A type of fungus that causes dis-\neases of the skin, including tinea or ringworm.\nKOH —The chemical formula for potassium\nhydroxide, which is used to perform the KOH test.The tests is also called a potassium hydroxidepreparation.\nThrush —A disease of the mouth, caused by Candi-\nda albicans and characterized by a whitish growth\nand ulcers. It can be diagnosed with the KOH test.\nTinea —A superficial infection of the skin, hair, or\nnails, caused by a fungus and commonly knownas ringworm.\nIf the KOH test is done in the doctor’s office, the\nresults are usually available while the person waits. If thetest is sent to a laboratory, the results will be ready thesame or following day. The KOH test is covered byinsurance when medically necessary.\nPreparation\nThe physician selects an infected area from which to\ncollect the sample. Scales and cells from the area arescraped using a scalpel. If the test is to be analyzedimmediately, the scrapings are placed directly onto amicroscope slide. If the test will be sent to a laboratory,the scrapings are placed in a sterile covered container.\nNormal results\nA normal, or negative, KOH test shows no fungi (no\ndermatophytes or yeast).\nAbnormal results\nDermatophytes or yeast seen on a KOH test indicate\nthe person has a fungal infection. Follow-up tests areusually unnecessary.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nCrissey, John Thorne. “Common Dermatophyte Infections.

Other conditions that\ncause thiamine deficiency occur quite rarely, but can beseen in patients undergoing dialysis (a procedure usedprimarily for patients suffering from kidney failure, dur-ing which the patient’s blood circulates outside of thebody, is mechanically cleansed, and then is circulatedback into the body), pregnant women with a conditioncalled hyperemesis gravidarum (a condition of extreme\nmorning sickness, during which the woman vomits upnearly all fluid and food intake), and patients aftersurgery who are given vitamin-free fluids for a prolongedperiod of time. Thiamine deficiency is an importantcause of disability in developing countries where themain source of food is polished rice (rice with the morenutritious outer husk removed).\nAn associated disorder, Wernicke’s syndrome, often\nprecedes Korsakoff’s syndrome. In fact, they so oftenoccur together that the spectrum of symptoms producedduring the course of the two diseases is frequentlyreferred to as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. The mainsymptoms of Wernicke’s syndrome include ataxia (diffi-culty in walking and maintaining balance), paralysis of\nsome of the muscles responsible for movement of theeyes, and confusion. Untreated Wernicke’s will lead tocoma and then death .\nCauses\nOne of the main reasons that alcoholism leads to thi-\namine deficiency has to do with the high-calorie natureof alcohol. A person with a large alcohol intake often, inessence, substitutes alcohol for other, more nutritivecalorie sources. Food intake drops off considerably, andmultiple vitamin deficiencies develop. Furthermore, it isbelieved that alcohol increases the body’s requirementsfor B vitamins , at the same time interfering with the\nabsorption of thiamine from the intestine and impairingthe body’s ability to store and use thiamine. Direct neu-rotoxic (poisonous damage to the nerves) effects of alco-hol may also play some role.\nThiamine is involved in a variety of reactions which\nprovide energy to the neurons (nerve cells) of the brain.When thiamine is unavailable, these reactions cannot becarried out, and the important end-products of the reactionsare not produced. Furthermore, certain other substancesbegin to accumulate, and are thought to cause damage tothe vulnerable neurons. The area of the brain believed to beresponsible for the symptoms of Korsakoff’s syndrome iscalled the diencephalon, specifically the structures calledthe mamillary bodies and the thalamus.\nSymptoms\nAn individual with Korsakoff’s syndrome displays\nmuch difficulty with memory. The main area of memoryaffected is the ability to learn new information. Usually,intelligence and memory for past events is relatively unaf-fected, so that an individual may remember what occurred20 years previously, but is unable to remember whatoccurred 20 minutes ago. This memory defect is referredto as anterograde amnesia , and leads to a peculiar symp-\ntom called “confabulation,” in which a person sufferingfrom Korsakoff’s fills in the gaps in his or her memorywith fabricated or imagined information. For instance, aperson may insist that a doctor to whom he or she has justbeen introduced is actually an old high school classmate,and may have a lengthy story to back this up. When asked,as part of a memory test, to remember the name of threeobjects which the examiner listed ten minutes earlier, aperson with Korsakoff’s may list three entirely differentobjects and be completely convincing in his or her certain-ty. In fact, one of the hallmarks of Korsakoff’s is the per-son’s complete unawareness of the memory defect, andcomplete lack of worry or concern when it is pointed out.\nDiagnosis\nWhenever someone has a possible diagnosis of alco-\nholism, and then has the sudden onset of memory difficul-ties, it is important to seriously consider the diagnosis ofKorsakoff’s syndrome. While there is no specific laborato-ry test to diagnose Korsakoff’s syndrome in a patient, acareful exam of the individual’s mental state should berather revealing. Although the patient’s ability to confabu-late answers may be convincing, checking the patient’sretention of factual information (asking, for example, forthe name of the current president of the United States),along with the patient’s ability to learn new information(repeating a series of numbers, or recalling the names ofthree objects ten minutes after having been asked to memo-rize them) should point to the diagnosis. Certainly a patientknown to have just begun recovery from Wernicke’s syn-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1930Korsakoff’s syndromedrome, who then begins displaying memory difficulties,\nwould be very likely to have developed Korsakoff’s syn-drome. A physical examination may also show signs of\nWernicke’s syndrome, such as peripheral neuropathy .\nTreatment\nTreatment of both Korsakoff’s and Wernicke’s syn-\ndromes involves the immediate administration of thi-amine. In fact, any individual who is hospitalized for anyreason and who is suspected of being an alcoholic,should receive thiamine. The combined Wernicke-Kor-sakoff syndrome has actually been precipitated in alco-holic patients hospitalized for other medical illnesses,due to the administration of thiamine-free intravenousfluids (intravenous fluids are those fluids containing vitalsugars and salts which are given to the patient through aneedle inserted in a vein). Also, the vitamin therapy maybe impaired by the feeding of carbohydrates prior to thegiving of thiamine; since carbohydrates cannot be metab-olized with thiamine.\nPrognosis\nFifteen to twenty percent of all patients hospitalized\nfor Wernicke’s syndrome will die of the disorder.Although the degree of ataxia nearly always improveswith treatment, half of those who survive will continue tohave some permanent difficulty walking. The paralysisof the eye muscles almost always resolves completelywith thiamine treatment. Recovery from Wernicke’sbegins to occur rapidly after thiamine is given. Improve-ment in the symptoms of Korsakoff’s syndrome, howev-er, can take months and months of thiamine replacement.Furthermore, patients who develop Korsakoff’s syn-drome are almost universally memory-impaired for therest of their lives. Even with thiamine treatment, thememory deficits tend to be irreversible, with less than20% of patients even approaching recovery. The develop-ment of Korsakoff’s syndrome often results in an indi-vidual requiring a supervised living situation.\nPrevention\nPrevention depends on either maintaining a diet with\na sufficient intake of thiamine, or supplementing an inad-equate diet with vitamin preparations. Certainly, one ofthe most important forms of prevention involves treatingthe underlying alcohol addiction .\nResources\nBOOKS\nMessing, Robert. “Nutritional Disorders of the Nervous Sys-\ntem.” In Cecil Textbook of Medicine , ed.

    "content": "Kyphosis\nDefinition\nKyphosis is the extreme curvature of the upper back\nalso known as a hunchback.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1931KyphosisDescription\nThe upper back bone (thoracic region), is normally\ncurved forward. If the curve exceeds 50° it is consideredabnormal (kyphotic).\nCauses and symptoms\nKyphosis can be divided into three ages of acquisi-\ntion—birth, old age, and the time in between.\n• Spinal birth defects can result in a fixed, exaggerated\ncurve. Vertebrae can be fused together, shaped wrong,extraneous, or partially missing. Congenital and heredi-tary defects in bone growth weaken bone and result inexaggerated curves wherever gravity or muscles pull onthem. Dwarfism is such a defect.\n• During life, several events can distort the spine.\nBecause the natural tendency of the thoracic spine is tocurve forward, any weakness of the supporting struc-tures will tend in that direction. A diseased thoracic ver-\ntebra (a spine bone) will ordinarily crumble its forwardedge first, increasing the kyphotic curve. Conditionsthat can do this include cancer ,tuberculosis , Scheuer-\nmann’s disease, and certain kinds of arthritis. Healthyvertebrae will fracture forward with rapid decelerationinjuries, such as in car crashes when the victim is notwearing a seat belt.\n• Later in life, kyphosis is caused from osteoporosis ,\nbone weakness, and crumbling forward.\nThe stress caused by kyphosis produces such symp-\ntoms as an increase in musculoskeletal pains, tensionheadaches, back aches, and joint pains.\nDiagnosis\nA quick look at the back will usually identify kypho-\nsis. X rays of the spine will confirm the diagnosis andidentify its cause.\nTreatment\nCongenital defects have to be repaired surgically.\nThe procedures are delicate, complicated, and lengthy.Often orthopedic hardware must be placed to stabilizethe back bone. At other times, a device called a Milwau-kee brace can hold the back in place from the outside.Fitting Milwaukee braces comfortably is difficultbecause they tend to rub and cause sores.\nKyphosis acquired during the younger years requires\ntreatment directed at the cause, such as medications fortuberculosis. Surgical reconstruction or bracing may alsobe necessary.\nKyphosis induced by osteoporosis is generally not\ntreated except to prevent further bone softening.\nPrognosis\nCongenital kyphosis may be alleviated to some\nextent by surgery and bracing. Kyphosis occurring laterin life may worsen over time.\nPrevention\nPreventing osteoporosis is within the grasp of mod-\nern medicine. Menopausal women must start early withestrogen replacement, calcium supplementation, andappropriate exercise . The treatment must continue\nthrough the remainder of life. Evidence suggests that ahigh calcium intake even during younger years delays theonset of symptomatic osteoporosis.

    "title": "Labyrinthitis",
    "content": "Labyrinthitis\nDefinition\nLabyrinthitis is an inflammation of the inner ear that\nis often a complication of otitis media . It is caused by\nthe spread of bacterial or viral infections from the heador respiratory tract into the inner ear.\nDescription\nLabyrinthitis is characterized by dizziness or feel-\nings of motion sickness caused by disturbance of the\nsense of balance.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThe disease agents that cause labyrinthitis may\nreach the inner ear by one of three routes:\n• Bacteria may be carried from the middle ear or the\nmembranes that cover the brain.\n• The viruses that cause mumps ,measles ,influenza ,\nand colds may reach the inner ear following an upperrespiratory infection.\n• The rubella virus can cause labyrinthitis in infants\nprior to birth.\nLabyrinthitis can also be caused by toxic drugs.\nSymptoms\nThe primary symptoms of labyrinthitis are vertigo\n(dizziness), accompanied by hearing loss and a sensa-tion of ringing in the ears called tinnitus . Vertigo occurs\nbecause the inner ear controls the sense of balance aswell as hearing. Some patients also experience nausea\nand vomiting and spontaneous eye movements in the\ndirection of the unaffected ear. Bacterial labyrinthitismay produce a discharge from the infected ear.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a combi-\nnation of the patient’s symptoms and history—especial-ly a history of a recent upper respiratory infection. Thedoctor will test the patient’s hearing, and order a labora-tory culture to identify the organism if the patient has adischarge.\nIf there is no history of a recent infection, the doctor\nwill order extra tests in order to exclude injuries to thebrain or Meniere’s disease .\nTreatment\nMedication\nPatients with labyrinthitis are given antibiotics ,\neither by mouth or intravenously to clear up the infec-tion. They may also be given meclizine (Antivert,Bonine) for vertigo and nausea.\nSurgery\nSome patients require surgery to drain the inner and\nmiddle ear.\nSupportive care\nPatients with labyrinthitis should rest in bed for\nthree to five days until the acute dizziness subsides.Patients who are dehydrated by repeated vomiting mayneed intravenous fluid replacement. In addition, patientsare advised to avoid driving or similar activities for fourto six weeks after the acute symptoms subside, becausethey may have occasional dizzy spells during that period.L\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1935Prognosis\nMost patients with labyrinthitis recover completely,\nalthough it often takes five to six weeks for the vertigo todisappear completely and the patient’s hearing to returnto normal.

Lacera-tions most often affect the skin, but any tissue may be lacer-ated, including subcutaneous fat, tendon, muscle, or bone.\nPurpose\nA laceration should be repaired if it:\n• continues to bleed after application of pressure for ten\nto fifteen minutes\n• is more than one-eighth to one-fourth inch deep\n• exposes fat, muscle, tendon, or bone• causes a change in function surrounding the area of the\nlaceration\n• is dirty or has visible debris in it• is located in an area where an unsightly scar is undesir-\nable\nPrecautions\nLacerations are less likely to become infected if they\nare repaired soon after they occur. Many physicians willnot repair a laceration that is more than eight hours oldbecause the risk of infection is too great.\nDescription\nLaceration repair mends a tear in the skin or other\ntissue. The procedure is similar to repairing a tear inclothing. Primary care physicians, emergency roomphysicians, and surgeons usually repair lacerations. Thefour goals of laceration repair are to stop bleeding, pre-vent infection, preserve function, and restore appearance.Insurance companies do pay for the procedure. Costdepends upon the severity and size of the laceration.\nBefore repairing the laceration, the physician thor-\noughly examines the wound and the underlying tendonsor nerves. If nerves or tendons have been injured, a sur-geon may be needed to complete the repair. The lacera-tion is cleaned by removing any foreign material ordebris.

If the lac-\neration is deep, several absorbable stitches (sutures) areplaced in the tissue under the skin to help bring the tissuelayers together. Suturing also helps eliminate any pocketswhere tissue fluid or blood can accumulate. The skinwound is closed with sutures. Suture material used on thesurface of a wound is usually non-absorbable and willhave to be removed later. A light dressing or an adhesivebandage is applied for 24-48 hours.

    "title": "Lacrimal duct obstruction",
    "content": "Lacrimal duct obstruction\nDefinition\nA lacrimal duct obstruction is blockage of the tear\nduct, the thin channel that normally drains tears from thesurface of the eye.\nDescription\nThe lacrimal glands, located above each eyeball,\nproduce tears. The tears flow over the eye, then drainthrough the nasolacrimal ducts. A tiny hole at the inneredge of each eyelid marks the opening of the ducts,which lead to the lacrimal sacs located on the side of thenose. The tears pass from the sacs into the nasolacrimalducts and then into the nose.\nWhen a tear duct becomes obstructed, tears may spill\nover the eyelids and run down the face. Stagnant tearswithin the system can become infected, leading to recur-rent red eyes and infections. Excessive tearing can alsoproduce secondary skin changes on the lower eyelids.KEY TERMS\nDebridement —The act of removing any foreign\nmaterial and damaged or contaminated tissue froma wound to expose surrounding healthy tissue.Causes and symptoms\nAn obstructed lacrimal tear duct can result in\ninflammation and infection of the lacrimal sac. The areabeneath the eyes next to the nose can become red,inflamed, and sensitive to the touch. The area usually isswollen, and there may be a mucous discharge from theopening of the nasal corner of the eye. Common com-plaints include itching , irritation, burning, redness, for-\neign body sensation, and tearing.\nChildren frequently have a congenital lacrimal duct\nobstruction. Six to ten percent of all children are bornbefore their tear ducts are open.\nIn adults, a common cause of lacrimal duct obstruc-\ntion is involution, which is progressive degenerationoccurring naturally with advancing age, resulting inshrivelling of organs or tissues. Other causes includeeyelid disorders , infections by bacteria, viruses, fungi,\nand parasites, inflammations, the use of eye drops orexcessive nasal spray, systemic chemotherapy , trauma\nfrom previous surgeries, injury to the bone at the side ofthe nose, foreign bodies, sinus disease, nasal polyps , and\nmalignant or benign tumors.\nDiagnosis\nIf the primary symptom is excessive tearing, the first\nstep is for the health care professional to determine if theoverflow of tears is due to an increase in tear productionor a decrease in tear drainage. Causes of increased tearproduction may include trichiasis, a disease in which theeyelashes produce constant irritation, and eyelid malpo-sitions and diseases. If abnormal tear production is ruledout, then obstructions in tear drainage is the most likelycause of the excessive tearing. Additional observations ofswollen lacrimal sac area and purulent eye dischargeindicate that there may be a lacrimal duct infection pre-sent. To further define the diagnosis, the lacrimal dis-charge may be cultured to determine possible infectiveagents, while various imaging techniques may be used todetect the type of obstruction. Dye tracer tests are alsoused to test for blockages.\nTreatment\nLacrimal duct obstructions in children often resolve\nspontaneously, with 95% showing resolution before thechild is one year old. Daily massaging of the lacrimal sacmay help open the blockage. A topical antibiotic ointmentmay be applied if infection is present. If the blockage isnot resolved after several weeks to months of this therapy,a physician may attempt forceful irrigation. Surgicalprobing to open up the duct under general anesthesia is alast resort, after a year or so of less invasive treatments.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1938Lacrimal duct obstructionIn adults, conservative treatments are usually recom-\nmended. The infected or inflamed area may be massaged,with warm compresses applied to provide relief and speedthe healing process. The health care provider may alsomassage or irrigate the infected area. Topical antibioticointments and oral antibiotics may also be used reduce\ninfection. The use of analgesics such as aspirin may be\nrecommended to control discomfort and reduce swelling.Severe cases may require surgical intervention to preventfuture recurrences. Surgical approaches include insertionof a probe or catheter to remove an obstruction or creationof an artificial duct to bypass the obstruction.\nPrognosis\nIf more conservative approaches fail to clear the\nobstruction, surgical procedures are available, with suc-cess rates greater than 90%.\nPrevention\nIn many cases, the cause of a lacrimal duct obstruc-\ntion is not known. However, in some cases, lacrimal ductobstruction may be caused by smoking and abuse of\nnasal sprays.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSullivan, David A., ed.

The enzyme is especially con-centrated in the heart, liver, red blood cells, kidneys,muscles, brain, and lungs. The total LDH can be furtherseparated into five components or fractions labeled bynumber: LDH-1, LDH-2, LDH-3, LDH-4, and LDH-5.Each of these fractions, called isoenzymes, is used main-ly by a different set of cells or tissues in the body. Forthis reason, the relative amounts of a particular isoen-zyme of LDH in the blood can provide valuable diagnos-tic information.\nPurpose\nThe LDH isoenzymes test assists in differentiating\nheart attack , anemia, lung injury, or liver disease from\nother conditions that may cause the same symptoms (dif-ferential diagnosis).\nPrecautions\nStrenuous exercise may raise levels of total LDH,\nspecifically the isoenzymes LDH-1, LDH-2, and LDH-5. Alcohol, anesthetics, aspirin , narcotics, pro-\ncainamide, fluorides, and mithramycin may also raiselevels of LDH. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can lower lev-els of LDH.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1939Lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes testDescription\nLDH is found in the cells of almost all body tissues.\nWhen certain conditions injure cells in tissues containingLDH, it is released into the bloodstream. Because LDHis so widely distributed throughout the body, analysis oftotal LDH will not help make a diagnosis of a particulardisease. Because this enzyme is actually composed offive different isoenzymes, however, analysis of the differ-ent LDH isoenzyme levels in the blood can help in thediagnosis of some diseases.\nThe five LDH isoenzymes are: LDH-1, LDH-2,\nLDH-3, LDH-4, and LDH-5. In general, each isoenzymeis used mostly by the cells in a specific tissue. LDH-1 isfound mainly in the heart. LDH-2 is primarily associatedwith the system in the body that defends against infection(reticuloendothelial system). LDH-3 is found in thelungs and other tissues, LDH-4 in the kidney, placenta,and pancreas, and LDH-5 in liver and striated (skeletal)muscle. Normally, levels of LDH-2 are higher than thoseof the other isoenzymes.\nCertain diseases have classic patterns of elevated\nLDH isoenzyme levels. For example, an LDH-1 levelhigher than that of LDH-2 is indicative of a heart attackor injury; elevations of LDH-2 and LDH-3 indicate lunginjury or disease; elevations of LDH-4 and LDH-5 indi-cate liver or muscle disease or both. A rise of all LDHisoenzymes at the same time is diagnostic of injury tomultiple organs. For example, a heart attack with conges-tive heart failure may cause symptoms of lung and liver\ncongestion. Advanced cancer and autoimmune diseases\nsuch as lupus can also cause this pattern.\nOne of the most important diagnostic uses for the\nLDH isoenzymes test is in the differential diagnosis ofmyocardial infarction or heart attack. The total LDHlevel rises within 24-48 hours after a heart attack, peaksin two to three days, and returns to normal in approxi-mately five to ten days. This pattern is a useful tool fora delayed diagnosis of heart attack. The LDH-1 isoen-zyme level, however, is more sensitive and specific thanthe total LDH. Normally, the level of LDH-2 is higherthan the level of LDH-1. An LDH-1 level higher thanthat of LDH-2, a phenomenon known as “flippedLDH,” is strongly indicative of a heart attack. Theflipped LDH usually appears within 12-24 hours after aheart attack. In about 80% of cases, flipped LDH is pre-sent within 48 hours of the incident. A normal LDH-1/LDH-2 ratio is considered reliable evidence that aheart attack has not occurred.\nIt should be noted that two conditions might cause\nelevated LDH isoenzymes at the same time and that onemay confuse the other. For example, a patient with pneu-\nmonia may also be having an acute heart attack. In thisinstance, the LDH-1 level would rise with the LDH-2\nand LDH-3. Because of this complication, some labora-tories measure only the LDH-1 and consider an elevatedLDH level with LDH-1 higher than 40% to be diagnosticof heart damage. LDH isoenzymes test is not used muchanymore for diagnosis of heart attack. Tests for the pro-tein troponin, which is found in myocardial cells, havebeen found to be more accurate.\nPreparation\nThis test requires a blood sample. The patient need\nnot fast (nothing to eat or drink) before the test unlessrequested to do so by the physician.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal. The patient may\nexperience slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,fainting or feeling lightheaded after the vein is punc-\ntured (venipuncture), or an accumulation of blood underthe puncture site (hematoma).\nNormal results\nReference values for normal levels of LDH isoen-\nzymes vary from laboratory to laboratory but can gener-ally be found within the following ranges:\n• LDH-1: 17-27%• LDH-2: 27-37%\n• LDH-3: 18-25%\n• LDH-4: 8-16%• LDH-5: 6-16%\nAbnormal results\nIncreased levels of LDH-1 are seen in myocardial\ninfarction, red blood cell diseases like hemolytic ane-\nmia, kidney disease including kidney transplantation\nrejection, and testicular tumors. Increased levels ofLDH-2 are found in lung diseases such as pneumoniaand congestive heart failure, as well as in lymphomasand other tumors. Elevations of LDH-3 are significant inlung disease and certain tumors. Elevations of LDH-4 aregreatly increased in pancreatitis . High levels of LDH-5\nare found in liver disease, intestinal problems, and skele-tal muscle disease and injury, such as muscular dystro-\nphyand recent muscular trauma.\nDiffuse disease or injury (for example, collagen dis-\nease, shock , low blood pressure) and advanced solid-\ntumor cancers cause significant elevations of all LDHisoenzymes at the same time.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1940Lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes testResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

These fractions are called isoenzymes and are bet-ter indicators of disease than is the total LDH. The frac-tions are LDH-1, LDH-2, LDH-3, LDH-4, and LDH-5. Anormal total LDH level does not mean that individualisoenzyme levels should not be measured. Individualisoenzyme ranges can help differentiate a diagnosis.\nDescription\nWhen disease or injury affects tissues containing\nLDH, the cells release LDH into the bloodstream, whereit is identified in higher than normal levels. For example,when a person has a heart attack, the LDH level begins torise about 12 hours after the attack and usually returns tonormal within five to 10 days. The LDH is also elevatedin diseases of the liver, in certain types of anemia, and incases of excessive destruction of cells, as in fractures ,\ntrauma, muscle damage, and shock .\nCancers can also elevate LDH level. Additionally,\nsome patients have chronically elevated LDH with noidentifiable cause and no apparent consequence.\nPreparation\nThis test requires a blood sample.

Normal values are also higher in child-hood. For adults, in most laboratories, the range can beup to approximately 200 units/L, but is usually foundwithin 45-90 U/L.\nAbnormal results\nDue to the fact that many common disease processes\ncause elevations in the total LDH level, a breakdown ofthe five different isoenzymes that make up the total LDHis often helpful for diagnosis.

Human milk contains theideal amount of nutrients for the infant, and providesimportant protection from diseases through the mother’snatural defenses.\nDescription\nEarly in a woman’s pregnancy her milk-producing\nglands begin to prepare for her baby’s arrival, and by thesixth month of pregnancy the breasts are ready to producemilk. Immediately after the baby is born, the placenta isKEY TERMS\nEnzyme —A protein that regulates the rate of a\nchemical reaction in the body, increasing thespeed at which the change occurs.\nIsoenzyme —One of a group of enzymes that cat-\nalyze the same reaction but are differentiated byvariations in physical properties.delivered. This causes a hormone in the woman’s body\n(prolactin) to activate the milk-producing glands. By thethird to fifth day, the woman’s breasts fill with milk.\nThen, as the baby continues to suck each day, nursing\ntriggers the continuing production of milk. The baby’ssucking stimulates nerve endings in the nipple, which sig-nal the mother’s pituitary gland to release oxytocin, a hor-mone that causes the mammary glands to release milk tothe nursing baby. This is called the “let-down reflex.”While the baby’s sucking is the primary stimulus for thisreflex, a baby’s cry, thoughts of the baby, or the sound ofrunning water also may trigger the response. Frequentnursing will lead to increased milk production.\nBreast milk cannot be duplicated by commercial\nbaby food formulas, although both contain protein, fat,and carbohydrates. In particular, breast milk changes tomeet the specific needs of a baby. The composition ofbreast milk changes as the baby grows, to meet thebaby’s changing needs. Most important, breast milk con-tains substances called antibodies from the mother thatcan protect the child against illness and allergies . Anti-\nbodies are part of the body’s natural defense systemagainst infections and other agents that can cause dis-ease. Breast milk also helps a baby’s own immune sys-tem mature faster. As a result, breast-fed babies havefewer ear infections, diarrhea ,rashes , allergies, and\nother medical problems than bottle-fed babies.\nThere are many other benefits to breast milk. Because\nit is easily digested, babies do not get constipated. Breast-fed babies have fewer speech impediments, and they havegood cheekbone development and jaw alignment.\nBreastfeeding is also good for the mother. The act of\nbreastfeeding releases hormones that stimulate the uterusto contract, helping it to return to normal size after deliv-ery and reducing the risk of bleeding. The act of producingmilk burns calories, which helps the mother to lose excess\nweight gained during pregnancy. Breastfeeding also maybe related to a lower risk of breast cancer ,ovarian can-\ncer, or cervical cancer . This benefit is stronger the\nyounger a woman is when she breastfeeds; women whobreastfeed before age 20 and nurse for at least six monthshave a 50% drop in the risk for breast cancer .\nIn addition, breastfeeding does not involve any for-\nmulas, bottles and nipples, or sterilizing equipment.Breast milk is free, and saves money by eliminating theneed to buy formula, bottles, and nipples. Becausebreast-fed babies are healthier, health care costs forbreast-fed infants are lower.\nProcedure\nBreastfeeding should begin as soon as possible after\nbirth, and should continue every two to three hours.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1942LactationHowever, all babies are different; some need to nurse\nalmost constantly at first, while others can go muchlonger between feedings. A baby should be fed at leasteight to 12 times in 24 hours. Because breast milk is easi-ly digested, a baby may be hungry again as soon as oneand one-half hours after the last meal.\nMothers should wear comfortable, loose, front-\nopening clothes and a good nursing bra. Mothers shouldfind a comfortable chair with lots of pillows, supportingthe arm and back. Feet should rest on a low footstool,with knees raised slightly. The baby should be level withthe breast. The new mother may have to experiment withdifferent ways of holding the baby before finding onethat is comfortable for both the mother and baby.\nSome babies have no trouble breastfeeding, while\nothers may need some assistance. Once the baby beginsto suck, the mother should make sure that the entire darkarea around the nipple is in the baby’s mouth. This willhelp stimulate milk flow, allowing the baby to getenough milk. It will also prevent nipple soreness.\nBreastfeeding mothers will usually offer the baby\nboth breasts at each feeding. Breastfeeding takes about15-20 minutes on each side. After stopping the feedingon one side, the mother should burp the baby beforebeginning the feeding on the other breast. If the babyfalls asleep at the breast, the next feeding should beginwith the breast that was not nursed.\nMothers can tell if the baby is getting enough milk\nby checking diapers; a baby who is wetting between fourto six disposable diapers (six to eight cloth) and who hasthree or four bowel movements in 24 hours is gettingenough milk.\nNursing problems\nNew mothers may experience nursing problems,\nincluding:\n• Engorged breasts. Breasts that are too full can prevent\nthe baby from sucking. Expressing milk manually orwith a breast pump can help.\n• Sore nipples. In the early weeks nipples may become\nsore; a nipple shield can ease discomfort.\n• Infection. Soreness and inflammation on the breast sur-\nface or a fever in the mother, may be an indication of\nbreast infection.

    "title": "Lactic acid test",
    "content": "Lactic acid test\nDefinition\nLactic acid is an acid produced by cells during\nchemical processes in the body that do not require oxy-gen (anaerobic metabolism). Anaerobic metabolismoccurs only when too little oxygen is present for themore usual aerobic metabolism (oxygen requiring). Lac-tic acid is a contributing factor in muscle cramps. It isalso produced in tissues when conditions such as heart\nattack or shock reduce the blood supply responsible for\ncarrying oxygen. Normally, lactic acid is removed fromthe blood by the liver. When an excess of lactic acidaccumulates for any reason, the result is a conditioncalled lactic acidosis.\nPurpose\nThe lactic acid test is used as an indirect assessment\nof the oxygen level in tissues and to determine the causeand course of lactic acidosis.\nPrecautions\nDuring blood collection, the patient should be\ninstructed to relax the hand. Clenching and unclenchingthe fist will cause a build-up of potassium and lactic acidfrom the hand muscles that will falsely elevate the levels.\nDescription\nThe degree of acidity is an important chemical prop-\nerty of blood and other body fluids. Acidity is expressedon a pH scale where 7.0 is neutral, above 7.0 is basic(alkaline), and below 7.0 is acidic. A strong acid has avery low pH (near 1.0). A strong base has a very high pH(near 14.0). Blood is normally slightly alkaline or basic. Ithas a pH range of 7.35-7.45. The balance of acid to basein blood is precisely controlled. Even a minor deviationfrom the normal range can severely affect many organs.\nLactic acid (present in the blood as lactate ion) is a\nproduct of the breakdown of glucose to generate energy.It is found primarily in muscle cells and red blood cells.The lactate ion concentration in the blood depends on therates of energy production and metabolism. Levels mayincrease significantly during exercise .\nTogether, lactic acid and another chemical (pyru-\nvate) form a reversible reaction regulated by the oxygensupply to the blood and tissues. When oxygen levels arelow, pyruvate converts to lactic acid; when oxygen lev-els are adequate, lactic acid converts to pyruvate. Whenthe liver fails to metabolize lactose sufficiently or whentoo much pyruvate converts to lactate, lactic acidosisoccurs. Measurement of blood lactate levels is recom-mended for all patients with symptoms of lactic acido-sis. Testing is generally indicated if the blood pH levelfalls below 7.25-7.35.\nBecause of the close relationship between pyru-\nvate and lactic acid, comparison of blood levels of thetwo substances can provide reliable information abouttissue oxidation. However, pyruvate measurement istechnically difficult and seldom performed. Lactic acidis measured more often, in either venous or arterialblood samples.\nPreparation\nThis test requires a blood sample. The patient should\nhave nothing to eat or drink ( fasting ) from midnight the\nnight before the test. Because lactic acid is produced byexertion, the patient should rest for at least one hourbefore the test.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal. The patient may\nexperience slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,fainting or feeling lightheaded after puncture of the vein\n(venipuncture), or an accumulation of blood under thepuncture site (hematoma).\nNormal results\nReference values vary from laboratory to laboratory\nbut can be found within the following ranges:\n• Venous blood: 4.5-19.8 mg/dL• Arterial blood: 4.5-14.4 mg/dL\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1944Lactic acid testAbnormal results\nHigh blood lactate levels, together with decreased\noxygen in tissues, may be caused by strenuous muscleexercise, shock, hemorrhage, severe infection in theblood stream, heart attack, or cardiac arrest. When tissueoxygenation is low for no apparent reason, increased lac-tate levels may be caused by systemic disorders like dia-betes, leukemia, liver disease, or kidney failure. Defectsin enzymes may also be responsible, as in glycogen stor-age disease (von Gierke’s disease). Lactate is alsoincreased in certain instances of intestinal obstruction.\nLactic acidosis can be caused by taking large doses\nof acetaminophen and alcohol and by intravenous infu-\nsion of epinephrine, glucagon, fructose, or sorbitol.Antifreeze poisoning can also cause lactic acidosis. In\nrare instances, a diabetic medication, metformin (Glu-cophage), causes lactic acidosis. People with weak kid-neys should not take metformin.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

Respiratory acidosis is caused byimpaired breathing caused by conditions such assevere chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, orairway obstruction.Lactose intolerance\nDefinition\nLactose intolerance refers to the inability of the\nbody to digest lactose.\nDescription\nLactose is the form of sugar present in milk. The\nenzyme lactase, which is normally produced by cells lin-ing the small intestine, breaks down lactose into sub-stances that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Whendairy products are ingested, the lactose reaches the diges-tive system and is broken down by lactase into the sim-pler sugars glucose and galactose. The liver changes thegalactose into glucose, which then enters the blood-stream and raises the blood glucose level. Lactose intol-erance occurs when, due to a deficiency of lactase, lac-tose is not completely broken down and the glucose leveldoes not rise. While not usually dangerous, lactose intol-erance can cause severe discomfort.\nFrom 30 to 50 million Americans suffer from the\nsymptoms of lactose intolerance, but not everyone who isdeficient in lactase experiences symptoms. Expertsbelieve that 75% of the adult population worldwide doesnot produce enough lactase and is at risk for some or allof the symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nCauses and symptoms\nLactose intolerance can be caused by some diseases\nof the digestive system and by injuries to the small intes-tine that result in a decreased production of lactase.While rare, some children are also born unable to pro-duce the enzyme. For many, however, lactase deficiencydevelops naturally because, after about two years of age,the body produces less lactase.\nSymptoms include nausea, cramps, diarrhea , bloat-\ning and gas. The symptoms usually occur between 30minutes to two hours after eating or drinking lactose-containing foods.\nDiagnosis\nUsually, health care professionals measure the\nabsorption of lactose in the digestive system by using thelactose tolerance test, hydrogen breath test or stool acidi-ty test. Each of these can be performed outpatient,through a hospital, clinic or doctor’s office.\nPeople taking the lactose tolerance test must fast\nbefore being tested. They then drink a lactose-containingliquid for the test and medical personnel take blood sam-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1945Lactose intoleranceples during the next two hours to measure the patient’s\nblood glucose level. The blood glucose level, or bloodsugar level, indicates how well the body is digesting thelactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance is confirmedwhen blood glucose level does not rise. This test is notadministered to infants and very young children becausethey are more prone to dehydration , which can result\nfrom diarrhea from the liquid.\nHealth care professionals measure the amount of\nhydrogen in the breath using the hydrogen breath test.Hydrogen is usually detected only in small amounts in thebreath. However when undigested lactose found in thecolon is fermented by bacteria, hydrogen in the breath isproduced in greater quantities. The hydrogen is exhaledafter being absorbed from the intestines and carriedthrough the bloodstream to the lungs. The hydrogenbreath test involves having the patient drink a lactose-con-taining beverage. Health care professionals monitor thebreath at regular intervals to see if the hydrogen levelsrise, which indicates improper lactose digestion. Peopletaking the test who have had certain foods, medications orcigarettes before the test may get inaccurate results.While the test is available to children and adults, new-borns and young children should not have it because ofthe risk of dehydration from drinking the beverage thatcan cause diarrhea in those who are lactose intolerant.\nA stool acidity test measures the amount of acid in\nthe stool. This is a safe test for newborns and young chil-dren. The test detects lactic acid and other short-chainfatty acids from undigested lactose fermented by bacteriain the colon. Glucose might also be in the stool sample,resulting form unabsorbed lactose in the colon.\nTreatment\nPediatricians might recommend that parents of new-\nborns and very young children who are suspected of havinglactose intolerance simply change from cow’s milk to asoya formula. Since there is no treatment that can improveKEY TERMS\nGalactose —Simple sugar derived from milk sugar.\nGlucose —A simple sugar and the chief energy\nsource in the\nLactase enzyme —The enzyme produced by cells\nthat line the small intestine which allows the bodyto break down lactose.\nLactose —The primary sugar in milk.the body’s ability to produce lactase, lactose deficiency\ntreatments instead, are focused on controlling the diet.\nMost people affected by lactose intolerance do well if\nthey limit their intake of lactose foods and drinks. Peoplediffer in the amounts they can handle before experiencingsymptoms. Some have to stop lactose completely. Peoplewho are sensitive after ingesting small amounts of lactosecan take lactase enzymes, which are available without aprescription. Using the liquid form, people can add a fewdrops in their milk, put the milk in the refrigerator anddrink it after 24 hours, when the lactase enzymes haveworked to reduce the lactose content by 70%. If the milkis heated first and double the amount of lactase liquid isadded, the milk will be 90 percent lactose free. Recently,researchers have developed a chewable lactase enzymetablet. By taking three to six tablets just before eating, thetablets help people digest lactose-containing solid foods.Supermarkets also carry lactose-reduced mild and otherproducts, which contain the needed nutrients found in theregular products but without the lactose.\nFoods that contain lactose are milk, low-fat milk,\nskim milk, chocolate milk, buttermilk, sweetened con-densed milk, dried whole milk, instant nonfat dry milk,low-fat yogurts, frozen yogurts ice cream, ice milk, sher-bet, cheese, cottage cheese, low-fat cottage cheese, creamand butter. Other foods that may contain hidden lactoseare: nondairy creamers, powdered artificial sweeteners,foods containing milk power or nonfat milk solids, bread,cake, margarine, creamed soups, pancakes, waffles,processed breakfast cereals, salad dressings, lunch meats,puddings, custards, confections and some meat products.\nPrognosis\nLactose intolerance is easy to manage. People of all\nages however, especially children, have to replace thecalcium lost by cutting back on milk products by takingsupplements and eating calcium-rich foods, such as broc-coli, kale, canned salmon with bones, calcium-fortifiedfoods and tofu. Many people who suffer with lactoseintolerance will be able to continue eating some milkproducts. The condition is not considered dangerous.\nPrevention\nOften, lactose intolerance is a natural occurrence\nthat cannot be avoided. However, people can preventsymptoms by managing the condition with diet and lac-tase supplements.\nResources\nORGANIZATIONS\nNational Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse.\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1946Lactose intoleranceDiseases.

    "title": "Laparoscopy",
    "content": "Laparoscopy\nDefinition\nLaparoscopy is a type of surgical procedure in which\na small incision is made, usually in the navel, throughwhich a viewing tube (laparoscope) is inserted. The view-ing tube has a small camera on the eyepiece. This allowsthe doctor to examine the abdominal and pelvic organs ona video monitor connected to the tube. Other small inci-sions can be made to insert instruments to perform proce-dures. Laparoscopy can be done to diagnose conditions orto perform certain types of operations. It is less invasivethan regular open abdominal surgery (laparotomy).\nPurpose\nSince the late 1980s, laparoscopy has been a popular\ndiagnostic and treatment tool. The technique dates backto 1901, when it was reportedly first used in a gynecolog-ic procedure performed in Russia. In fact, gynecologistswere the first to use laparoscopy to diagnose and treatconditions relating to the female reproductive organs:uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.\nLaparoscopy was first used with cancer patients in\n1973. In these first cases, the procedure was used to observeand biopsy the liver. Laparoscopy plays a role in the diagno-sis, staging, and treatment for a variety of cancers.\nAs of 2001, the use of laparoscopy to completely\nremove cancerous growths and surrounding tissues (inplace of open surgery) is controversial. The procedure isbeing studied to determine if it is as effective as opensurgery in complex operations. Laparoscopy is also beinginvestigated as a screening tool for ovarian cancer .\nLaparoscopy is widely used in procedures for non-\ncancerous conditions that in the past required opensurgery, such as removal of the appendix ( appendecto-\nmy) and gallbladder removal ( cholecystectomy ).\nDiagnostic procedure\nAs a diagnostic procedure, laparoscopy is useful in\ntaking biopsies of abdominal or pelvic growths, as wellas lymph nodes. It allows the doctor to examine theabdominal area, including the female organs, appendix,gallbladder, stomach, and the liver.\nLaparoscopy is used to determine the cause of pelvic\npain or gynecological symptoms that cannot be con-\nfirmed by a physical exam or ultrasound. For example,ovarian cysts ,endometriosis ,ectopic pregnancy ,o r\nblocked fallopian tubes can be diagnosed using this pro-cedure. It is an important tool when trying to determinethe cause of infertility .\nOperative procedure\nWhile laparoscopic surgery to completely remove\ncancerous tumors, surrounding tissues, and lymph nodesis used on a limited basis, this type of operation is widelyused in noncancerous conditions that once required opensurgery. These conditions include:\n• Tubal ligation. In this procedure, the fallopian tubes are\nsealed or cut to prevent subsequent pregnancies.\n• Ectopic pregnancy . If a fertilized egg becomes embed-\nded outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube, anoperation must be performed to remove the developingembryo. This often can be done with laparoscopy.\n• Endometriosis. This is a condition in which tissue from\ninside the uterus is found outside the uterus in otherparts of (or on organs within) the pelvic cavity. This cancause cysts to form. Endometriosis is diagnosed withlaparoscopy, and in some cases the cysts and other tis-sue can be removed during laparoscopy.\n• Hysterectomy. This procedure to remove the uterus can,\nin some cases, be performed using laparoscopy. Theuterus is cut away with the aid of the laparoscopic instru-ments and then the uterus is removed through the vagina.\n• Ovarian masses. Tumors or cysts in the ovaries can be\nremoved using laparoscopy.\n• Appendectomy. This surgery to remove an inflamed\nappendix required open surgery in the past. It is nowroutinely performed with laparoscopy.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1947Laparoscopy• Cholecystectomy. Like appendectomy, this procedure to\nremove the gall bladder used to require open surgery. Nowit can be performed with laparoscopy, in some cases.\nIn contrast to open abdominal surgery, laparoscopy\nusually involves less pain, less risk, less scarring, andfaster recovery. Because laparoscopy is so much lessinvasive than traditional abdominal surgery, patients canleave the hospital sooner.\nCancer staging\nLaparoscopy can be used in determining the spread\nof certain cancers. Sometimes it is combined with ultra-sound. Although laparoscopy is a useful staging tool, itsuse depends on a variety of factors, which are consideredfor each patient. Types of cancers where laparoscopy maybe used to determine the spread of the disease include:\n• Liver cancer. Laparoscopy is an important tool for\ndetermining if cancer is present in the liver. When apatient has non-liver cancer, the liver is often checkedto see if the cancer has spread there. Laparoscopy canidentify up to 90% of malignant lesions that havespread to that organ from a cancer located elsewhere inthe body. While computerized tomography (CT) canfind cancerous lesions that are 0.4 in (10 mil) in size,laparoscopy is capable of locating lesions that are assmall as 0.04 in (1 millimeter).\n• Pancreatic cancer. Laparoscopy has been used to evalu-\nate pancreatic cancer for years. In fact, the first reporteduse of laparoscopy in the United States was in a case\ninvolving pancreatic cancer.\n• Esophageal and stomach cancers. Laparoscopy has\nbeen found to be more effective than magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography\n(CT) in diagnosing the spread of cancer from theseorgans.\n•Hodgkin’s disease . Some patients with Hodgkin’s dis-\nease have surgical procedures to evaluate lymph nodesfor cancer. Laparoscopy is sometimes selected overlaparotomy for this procedure. In addition, the spleenmay be removed in patients with Hodgkin’s disease.Laparoscopy is the standard surgical technique for thisprocedure, which is called a splenectomy.\n•Prostate cancer . Patients with prostate cancer may\nhave the nearby lymph nodes examined. Laparoscopyis an important tool in this procedure.\nCancer treatment\nLaparoscopy is sometimes used as part of a pallia-\ntive cancer treatment. This type of treatment is not a cure,but can often lessen the symptoms. An example is thefeeding tube, which cancer patients may have if they areunable to take in food by mouth. The feeding tube pro-vides nutrition directly into the stomach. Inserting the\ntube with a laparoscopy saves the patient the ordeal ofopen surgery.\nPrecautions\nAs with any surgury, patients should notify their\nphysician of any medications they are taking (prescrip-tion, over-the-counter, or herbal) and of any allergies .\nPrecautions vary due to the several different purposes forlaparoscopy. Patients should expect to rest for severaldays after the procedure, and should set up a comfortableenvironment in their home (with items such as pain med-ication, heating pads, feminine products, comfortableclothing, and food readily accessible) prior to surgery.\nDescription\nLaparoscopy is a surgical procedure that is done in\nthe hospital under anesthesia. For diagnosis and biopsy,local anesthesia is sometimes used. In operative proce-dures, such as abdominal surgery, general anesthesia isrequired. Before starting the procedure, a catheter isinserted through the urethra to empty the bladder, and theskin of the abdomen is cleaned.\nAfter the patient is anesthetized, a hollow needle is\ninserted into the abdomen in or near the navel, and car-bon dioxide gas is pumped through the needle to expand\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1948Laparoscopy\nThis surgeon is performing a laparoscopic procedure on a\npatient. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)the abdomen. This allows the surgeon a better view of the\ninternal organs. The laparoscope is then inserted throughthis incision to look at the internal organs. The imagefrom the camera attached to the end of the laparoscope isseen on a video monitor.\nSometimes, additional small incisions are made to\ninsert other instruments that are used to lift the tubes andovaries for examination or to perform surgical procedures.\nPreparation\nPatients should not eat or drink after midnight on the\nnight before the procedure.\nAftercare\nAfter the operation, nurses will check the vital signs\nof patients who had general anesthesia. If there are nocomplications, the patient may leave the hospital withinfour to eight hours. (Traditional abdominal surgeryrequires a hospital stay of several days).\nThere may be some slight pain or throbbing at the inci-\nsion sites in the first day or so after the procedure. The gasthat is used to expand the abdomen may cause discomfortunder the ribs or in the shoulder for a few days. Dependingon the reason for the laparoscopy in gynecological proce-dures, some women may experience some vaginal bleed-ing. Many patients can return to work within a week ofsurgery and most are back to work within two weeks.\nRisks\nLaparoscopy is a relatively safe procedure, especial-\nly if the physician is experienced in the technique. Therisk of complication is approximately 1%.\nThe procedure carries a slight risk of puncturing a blood\nvessel or organ, which could cause blood to seep into theabdominal cavity. Puncturing the intestines could allowintestinal contents to seep into the cavity. These are seriouscomplications and major surgery may be required to correctthe problem. For operative procedures, there is the possibilitythat it may become apparent that open surgery is required.Serious complications occur at a rate of only 0.2%.\nRare complications include:\n• hemorrhage\n• inflammation of the abdominal cavity lining\n• abscess• problems related to general anesthesia\nLaparoscopy is generally not used in patients with\ncertain heart or lung conditions, or in those who havesome intestinal disorders, such as bowel obstruction.KEY TERMS\nBiopsy —Microscopic evaluation of a tissue sam-\nple.

    "title": "Laryngeal cancer",
    "content": "Laryngeal cancer\nDefinition\nLaryngeal cancer is cancer of the larynx or voice box.\nDescription\nThe larynx is located where the throat divides into\nthe esophagus and the trachea. The esophagus is the tubethat takes food to the stomach. The trachea, or windpipe,takes air to the lungs. The area where the larynx is locat-ed is sometimes called the Adam’s apple.\nThe larynx has two main functions. It contains the\nvocal cords, cartilage, and small muscles that make up thevoice box. When a person speaks, small muscles tighten thevocal cords, narrowing the distance between them. As air isexhaled past the tightened vocal cords, it creates sounds thatare formed into speech by the mouth, lips, and tongue.\nThe second function of the larynx is to allow air to\nenter the trachea and to keep food, saliva, and foreignmaterial from entering the lungs. A flap of tissue calledthe epiglottis covers the trachea each time a person swal-lows. This blocks foreign material from entering thelungs. When not swallowing, the epiglottis retracts, andair flows into the trachea. During treatment for cancer ofthe larynx, both of these functions may be lost.\nCancers of the larynx develop slowly. About 95% of\nthese cancers develop from thin, flat cells similar to skincells called squamous epithelial cells. These cells line thelarynx. Gradually, the squamous epithelial cells begin tochange and are replaced with abnormal cells. Theseabnormal cells are not cancerous but are pre-malignantcells that have the potential to develop into cancer. Thiscondition is called dysplasia. Most people with dysplasianever develop cancer. The condition simply goes awaywithout any treatment, especially if the person with dys-plasia stops smoking or drinking alcohol.\nThe larynx is made up of three parts, the glottis, the\nsupraglottis, and the subglottis. Cancer can start in any ofthese regions. Treatment and survival rates depend onwhich parts of the larynx are affected and whether thecancer has spread to neighboring areas of the neck or dis-tant parts of the body.The glottis is the middle part of the larynx. It con-\ntains the vocal cords. Cancers that develop on the vocalcords are often diagnosed very early because even smallvocal cord tumors cause hoarseness. In addition, thevocal cords have no connection to the lymphatic system.This means that cancers on the vocal cord do not spreadeasily. When confined to the vocal cords without anyinvolvement of other parts of the larynx, the cure rate forthis cancer is 75% to 95%.\nThe supraglottis is the area above the vocal cords. It\ncontains the epiglottis, which protects the trachea fromforeign materials. Cancers that develop in this region areusually not found as early as cancers of the glottisbecause the symptoms are less distinct. The supraglottisregion has many connections to the lymphatic system, socancers in this region tend to spread easily to the lymphnodes and may spread to other parts of the body (lymphnodes are small bean-shaped structures that are foundthroughout the body; they produce and store infection-fighting cells). In 25% to 50% of people with cancer inthe supraglottal region, the cancer has already spread tothe lymph nodes by the time they are diagnosed. Becauseof this, survival rates are lower than for cancers thatinvolve only the glottis.\nThe subglottis is the region below the vocal cords.\nCancer starting in the subglottis region is rare. When itdoes, it is usually detected only after it has spread to thevocal cords, where it causes obvious symptoms such ashoarseness. Because the cancer has already begun tospread by the time it is detected, survival rates are gener-ally lower than for cancers in other parts of the larynx.\nAbout 12,000 new cases of cancer of the larynx\ndevelop in the United States each year. Each year, about3,900 die of the disease. Laryngeal cancer is betweenfour and five times more common in men than inwomen. Almost all men who develop laryngeal cancerare over age 55. Laryngeal cancer is about 50% morecommon among African-American men than amongother Americans.\nIt is thought that older men are more likely to devel-\nop laryngeal cancer than women because the two mainrisk factors for acquiring the disease are lifetime habitsof smoking and alcohol abuse. More men are heavysmokers and drinkers than women, and more African-American men are heavy smokers than other men in theUnited States. However, as smoking becomes moreprevalent among women, it seems likely that more casesof laryngeal cancer in females will be seen.\nCauses and symptoms\nLaryngeal cancer develops when the normal cells\nlining the larynx are replaced with abnormal cells (dys-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1950Laryngeal cancerplasia) that become malignant and reproduce to form\ntumors. The development of dysplasia is strongly linkedto life-long habits of smoking and heavy use of alcohol.The more a person smokes, the greater the risk of devel-oping laryngeal cancer. It is unusual for someone whodoes not smoke or drink to develop cancer of the larynx.Occasionally, however, people who inhale asbestos parti-cles, wood dust, paint or industrial chemical fumes overa long period of time develop the disease.\nThe symptoms of laryngeal cancer depend on the\nlocation of the tumor. Tumors on the vocal cords are rarelypainful, but cause hoarseness. Anyone who is continuallyhoarse for more than two weeks or who has a cough thatdoes not go away should be checked by a doctor.\nTumors in the supraglottal region above the vocal\ncords often cause more, but less distinct symptoms.These include:\n• persistent sore throat• pain when swallowing• difficulty swallowing or frequent choking on food• bad breath• lumps in the neck• persistent ear pain (called referred pain; the source of\nthe pain is not the ear)\n• change in voice quality\nTumors that begin below the vocal cords are rare,\nbut may cause noisy or difficult breathing. All the symp-toms above can also be caused other cancers as well asby less seriousness illnesses. However, if these symp-toms persist, it is important to see a doctor and find theircause, because the earlier cancer treatment begins, themore successful it is.\nDiagnosis\nOn the first visit to a doctor for symptoms that suggest\nlaryngeal cancer, the doctor first takes a complete medicalhistory, including family history of cancer and lifestyleinformation about smoking and alcohol use. The doctoralso does a physical examination, paying special attentionto the neck region for lumps, tenderness, or swelling.\nThe next step is examination by an otolaryngologist,\nor ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. This doctor alsoperforms a physical examination, but in addition willalso want to look inside the throat at the larynx. Initially,the doctor may spray a local anesthetic on the back of thethroat to prevent gagging, then use a long-handled mirrorto look at the larynx and vocal cords. This examination isdone in the doctor’s office. It may cause gagging but isusually painless.A more extensive examination involves a laryn-\ngoscopy. In a laryngoscopy, a lighted fiberoptic tubecalled a laryngoscope that contains a tiny camera isinserted through the patient’s nose and mouth and snakeddown the throat so that the doctor can see the larynx andsurrounding area. This procedure can be done with asedative and local anesthetic in a doctor’s office. Moreoften, the procedure is done in an outpatient surgery clinicor hospital under general anesthesia. This allows the doc-tor to use tiny clips on the end of the laryngoscope to takebiopsies (tissue samples) of any abnormal-looking areas.\nLaryngoscopies are normally painless and take\nabout one hour. Some people find their throat feelsscratchy after the procedure. Since laryngoscopies aredone under sedation, patients should not drive immedi-ately after the procedure, and should have someone avail-able to take them home. Laryngoscopy is a standard pro-cedure that is covered by insurance.\nThe locations of the samples taken during the laryn-\ngoscopy are recorded, and the samples are then sent tothe laboratory where they are examined under the micro-scope by a pathologist who specializes in diagnosing dis-eases through cell samples and laboratory tests. It maytake several days to get the results. Based on the findingsof the pathologist, cancer can be diagnosed and staged.\nOnce cancer is diagnosed, other tests will probably be\ndone to help determine the exact size and location of thetumors. This information is helpful in determining whichtreatments are most appropriate. These tests may include:\n• Endoscopy. Similar to a laryngoscopy, this test is done\nwhen it appears that cancer may have spread to otherareas, such as the esophagus or trachea.\n• Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan. Using x-ray\nimages taken from several angles and computer model-ing, CT scans allow parts of the body to be seen as across section. This helps locate and size the tumors, andprovides information on whether they can be surgicallyremoved.\n• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses magnets\nand radio waves to create more detailed cross-sectionalscans than computed tomography. This detailed infor-mation is needed if surgery on the larynx area isplanned.\n• Barium swallow. Barium is a substance that, unlike soft\ntissue, shows up on x rays. Swallowed barium coats thethroat and allows x-ray pictures to be made of the tis-sues lining the throat.\n• Chest x ray. Done to determine if cancer has spread to\nthe lungs. Since most people with laryngeal cancer aresmokers, the risk of also having lung cancer or emphy-sema is high.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1951Laryngeal cancer• Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. If any lumps on\nthe neck are found, a thin needle is inserted into thelump, and some cells are removed for analysis by thepathologist.\n• Additional blood and urine tests. These tests do not\ndiagnose cancer, but help to determine the patient’sgeneral health and provide information to determinewhich cancer treatments are most appropriate.\nTreatment\nStaging\nOnce cancer of the larynx is found, more tests will\nbe done to find out if cancer cells have spread to otherparts of the body. This is called staging. A doctor needsto know the stage of the disease to plan treatment. In can-cer of the larynx, the definitions of the early stagesdepend on where the cancer started.\nSTAGE I. The cancer is only in the area where it\nstarted and has not spread to lymph nodes in the area orto other parts of the body. The exact definition of stage Idepends on where the cancer started, as follows:\n• Supraglottis: The cancer is only in one area of the\nsupraglottis and the vocal cords can move normally.\n• Glottis: The cancer is only in the vocal cords and the\nvocal cords can move normally.\n• Subglottis: The cancer has not spread outside of the\nsubglottis.\nSTAGE II. The cancer is only in the larynx and has\nnot spread to lymph nodes in the area or to other parts ofthe body. The exact definition of stage II depends onwhere the cancer started, as follows:\n• Supraglottis: The cancer is in more than one area of the\nsupraglottis, but the vocal cords can move normally.\n• Glottis: The cancer has spread to the supraglottis or the\nsubglottis or both. The vocal cords may or may not beable to move normally.\n• Subglottis: The cancer has spread to the vocal cords,\nwhich may or may not be able to move normally.\nSTAGE III. Either of the following may be true:\n• The cancer has not spread outside of the larynx, but the\nvocal cords cannot move normally, or the cancer hasspread to tissues next to the larynx.\n• The cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same\nside of the neck as the cancer, and the lymph node mea-sures no more than 3 centimeters (just over 1 inch).\nSTAGE IV. Any of the following may be true:• The cancer has spread to tissues around the larynx,\nsuch as the pharynx or the tissues in the neck. Thelymph nodes in the area may or may not contain cancer.\n• The cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on\nthe same side of the neck as the cancer, to lymph nodeson one or both sides of the neck, or to any lymph nodethat measures more than 6 centimeters (over 2 inches).\n• The cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nRECURRENT. Recurrent disease means that the cancer\nhas come back (recurred) after it has been treated. It maycome back in the larynx or in another part of the body.\nTreatment\nTreatment is based on the stage of the cancer as well\nas its location and the health of the individual. Generally,there are three types of treatments for cancer of the lar-ynx. These are surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.They can be used alone or in combination based in thestage of the caner. Getting a second opinion after the can-cer has been staged can be very helpful in sorting outtreatment options and should always be considered.\nSURGERY. The goal of surgery is to cut out the tissue\nthat contains malignant cells. There are several commonsurgeries to treat laryngeal cancer.\nStage III and stage IV cancers are usually treated with\ntotal laryngectomy. This is an operation to remove theentire larynx. Sometimes other tissues around the larynxare also removed. Total laryngectomy removes the vocalcords. Alternate methods of voice communication must belearned with the help of a speech pathologist. Laryngecto-my is treated in depth as a separate entry in this volume.\nSmaller tumors are sometimes treated by partial\nlaryngectomy. The goal is to remove the cancer but saveas much of the larynx (and corresponding speech capa-bility) as possible. Very small tumors or cancer in situ aresometimes successfully treated with laser excisionsurgery. In this type of surgery, a narrowly-targeted beamof light from a laser is used to remove the cancer.\nAdvanced cancer (Stages III and IV) that has spread\nto the lymph nodes often requires an operation called aneck dissection. The goal of a neck dissection is toremove the lymph nodes and prevent the cancer fromspreading. There are several forms of neck dissection. Aradical neck dissection is the operation that removes themost tissue.\nSeveral other operations are sometimes performed\nbecause of laryngeal cancer. A tracheotomy is a surgicalprocedure in which an artificial opening is made in thetrachea (windpipe) to allow air into the lungs. This oper-ation is necessary if the larynx is totally removed. A gas-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1952Laryngeal cancertrectomy tube is a feeding tube placed through skin and\ndirectly into the stomach. It is used to give nutrition topeople who cannot swallow or whose esophagus isblocked by a tumor. People who have a total laryngecto-my usually do not need a gastrectomy tube if their esoph-agus remains intact.\nRADIATION. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays,\nsuch as x rays or gamma rays, to kill cancer cells. Theadvantage of radiation therapy is that it preserves the larynxand the ability to speak. The disadvantage is that it may notkill all the cancer cells. Radiation therapy can be used alonein early stage cancers or in combination with surgery.Sometimes it is tried first with the plan that if it fails to curethe cancer, surgery still remains an option. Often, radiationtherapy is used after surgery for advanced cancers to killany cells the surgeon might not have removed.\nThere are two types of radiation therapy. External\nbeam radiation therapy focuses rays from outside thebody on the cancerous tissue. This is the most commontype of radiation therapy used to treat laryngeal cancer.With internal radiation therapy, also called brachythera-py, radioactive materials are placed directly on the can-cerous tissue. This type of radiation therapy is a muchless common treatment for laryngeal cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy is given in doses called\nfractions. A common treatment involves giving fractionsfive days a week for seven weeks. Clinical trials areunderway to determine the benefits of accelerating thedelivery of fractions (accelerated fractionation) or divid-ing fractions into smaller doses given more than once aday (hyperfractionation). Side effects of radiation thera-py include dry mouth, sore throat, hoarseness, skin prob-lems, trouble swallowing, and diminished ability to taste.\nCHEMOTHERAPY. Chemotherapy is the use of drugs\nto kill cancer cells. Unlike radiation therapy, which is tar-geted to a specific tissue, chemotherapy drugs are eithertaken by mouth or intravenously (through a vein) and cir-culate throughout the whole body. They are used mainlyto treat advanced laryngeal cancer that is inoperable orthat has metastasized to a distant site. Chemotherapy isoften used after surgery or in combination with radiationtherapy. Clinical trials are underway to determine thebest combination of treatments for advanced cancer.\nThe two most common chemotherapy drugs used to\ntreat laryngeal cancer are cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). There are many side effects associated withchemotherapy drugs, including nausea and vomiting,loss of appetite, hair loss, diarrhea, and mouth sores.Chemotherapy can also damage the blood-producingcells of the bone marrow, which can result in low bloodcell counts, increased chance of infection, and abnormalbleeding or bruising.KEY TERMS\nDysplasia —The abnormal change in size, shape\nor organization of adult cells.\nLymph —Clear, slightly yellow fluid carried by a\nnetwork of thin tubes to every part of the body.Cells that fight infection are carried in the lymph.\nLymphatic system —Primary defense against infec-\ntion in the body.

Cells tend to reproduce\nwithout normal controls on growth and formtumors or invade other tissues.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative and complementary therapies range\nfrom herbal remedies, vitamin supplements, and specialdiets to spiritual practices, acupuncture, massage, andsimilar treatments. When these therapies are used inaddition to conventional medicine, they are called com-plementary therapies. When they are used instead of con-ventional medicine, they are called alternative therapies.\nComplementary or alternative therapies are widely\nused by people with cancer. One large study published inthe Journal of Clinical Oncology in July, 2000 found that\n83% of all cancer patients studied used some form ofcomplementary or alternative medicine as part of theircancer treatment. No specific alternative therapies havebeen directed toward laryngeal cancer. However, goodnutrition and activities that reduce stress and promote apositive view of life have no unwanted side-effects andappear to be beneficial in boosting the immune system infighting cancer.\nUnlike traditional pharmaceuticals, complementary\nand alternative therapies are not evaluated by the UnitedStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for eithersafety or effectiveness. These therapies may have inter-actions with traditional pharmaceuticals. Patients shouldbe wary of “miracle cures” and notify their doctors if\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1953Laryngeal cancerthey are using herbal remedies, vitamin supplements or\nother unprescribed treatments. Alternative and experi-mental treatments normally are not covered by insurance.\nPrognosis\nCure rates and survival rates can predict group out-\ncomes, but can never precisely predict the outcome for asingle individual. However, the earlier laryngeal canceris discovered and treated, the more likely it will be cured.\nCancers found in stage 0 and stage 1 have a 75% to\n95% cure rate depending on the site. Late stage cancersthat have metastasized have a very poor survival rate,with intermediate stages falling somewhere in between.People who have had laryngeal cancer are at greatest riskfor recurrence (having cancer come back), especially inthe head and neck, during the first two to three years aftertreatment. Check-ups during the first year are neededevery other month, and four times a year during the sec-ond year. It is rare for laryngeal cancer to recur after fiveyears of being cancer-free.\nPrevention\nBy far, the most effective way to prevent laryngeal\ncancer is not to smoke.

    "title": "Laryngectomy",
    "content": "Laryngectomy\nDefinition\nLaryngectomy is the partial or complete surgical\nremoval of the larynx, usually as a treatment for cancer\nof the larynx.\nPurpose\nNormally a laryngectomy is performed to remove\ntumors or cancerous tissue. In rare cases, it may be donewhen the larynx is badly damaged by gunshot, automo-bile injuries, or similar violent accidents. Laryngec-tomies can be total or partial. Total laryngectomies aredone when cancer is advanced. The entire larynx is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1954Laryngectomyremoved. Often if the cancer has spread, other surround-\ning structures in the neck, such as lymph nodes, areremoved at the same time. Partial laryngectomies aredone when cancer is limited to one spot. Only the areawith the tumor is removed. Laryngectomies may also beperformed when other cancer treatment options, such asradiation or chemotherapy , fail.\nPrecautions\nLaryngectomy is done only after cancer of the lar-\nynx has been diagnosed by a series of tests that allow theotolaryngologist (a specialist often called an ear, nose,and throat doctor) to look into the throat and take tissuesamples (biopsies) to confirm and stage the cancer. Peo-ple need to be in good general health to undergo a laryn-gectomy, and will have standard pre-operative bloodwork and tests to make sure they are able to safely with-stand the operation.\nDescription\nThe larynx is located slightly below the point where\nthe throat divides into the esophagus, which takes food tothe stomach, and the trachea (windpipe), which takes airto the lungs. Because of its location, the larynx plays acritical role in normal breathing, swallowing, and speak-ing. Within the larynx, vocal folds (often called vocalcords) vibrate as air is exhaled past, thus creating speech.The epiglottis protects the trachea, making sure that onlyair gets into the lungs. When the larynx is removed, thesefunctions are lost.\nOnce the larynx is removed, air can no longer flow\ninto the lungs. During this operation, the surgeon removesthe larynx through an incision in the neck. The surgeonalso performs a tracheotomy . He makes an artificial\nopening called a stoma in the front of the neck. The upperportion of the trachea is brought to the stoma and secured,making a permanent alternate way for air to get to thelungs. The connection between the throat and the esopha-gus is not normally affected, so after healing, the personwhose larynx has been removed (called a laryngectomee)can eat normally. However, normal speech is no longerpossible. Several alternate means of vocal communicationcan be learned with the help of a speech pathologist.\nPreparation\nAs with any surgical procedure, the patient will be\nrequired to sign a consent form after the procedure isthoroughly explained. Many patients prefer a secondopinion, and some insurers require it. Blood and urinestudies, along with chest x ray and EKG may be ordered\nas the doctor deems necessary. The patient also has a pre-operative meeting with an anesthesiologist. If a complete\nlaryngectomy is planned, it may be helpful to meet with aspeech pathologist and/or an established laryngectomeefor discussion of post-operative expectations and support.\nAftercare\nA person undergoing a laryngectomy spends several\ndays in intensive care (ICU) and receives intravenous(IV) fluids and medication. As with any major surgery,the blood pressure, pulse, and respirations are monitoredregularly. The patient is encouraged to turn, cough , and\ndeep breathe to help mobilize secretions in the lungs.One or more drains are usually inserted in the neck toremove any fluids that collect. These drains are removedafter several days.\nIt takes two to three weeks for the tissues of the\nthroat to heal. During this time, the laryngectomee can-not swallow food and must receive nutrition through a\ntube inserted through the nose and down the throat intothe stomach. During this time, even people with partiallaryngectomies are unable to speak.\nWhen air is drawn in normally through the nose, it is\nwarmed and moistened before it reaches the lungs. Whenair is drawn in through the stoma, it does not have theopportunity to be warmed and humidified. In order tokeep the stoma from drying out and becoming crusty,laryngectomees are encouraged to breathe artificiallyhumidified air. The stoma is usually covered with a lightcloth to keep it clean and to keep unwanted particlesfrom accidentally entering the lungs. Care of the stoma isextremely important, since it is the person’s only way toget air to the lungs. After a laryngectomy, a healthcareprofessional will teach the laryngectomee and his or hercaregivers how to care for the stoma.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1955Laryngectomy\nA pathology photograph of an extracted tumor found on the\nlarynx. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permis-\nsion.)Immediately after a laryngectomy, an alternate\nmethod of communication such as writing notes, gestur-ing, or pointing must be used. A partial laryngectomypatient will gradually regain some speech several weeksafter the operation, but the voice may be hoarse, weak, andstrained. A speech pathologist will work with a completelaryngectomee to establish new ways of communicating.\nThere are three main methods of vocalizing after a total\nlaryngectomy. In esophageal speech the laryngectomeelearns how to “swallow” air down into the esophagus andcreates sounds by releasing the air. This method requiresquite a bit of coordination and learning, and produces shortbursts (seven or eight syllables) of low-volume sound.\nTracheoesophageal speech diverts air through a hole\nin the trachea made by the surgeon. The air then passesthrough an implanted artificial voice prosthesis (a smalltube that makes a sound when air goes through it).Recent advances have been made in implanting voiceprostheses that produce good voice quality.\nThe third method of artificial sound communication\ninvolves using a hand-held electronic device that trans-lates vibrations into sounds. There are several differentstyles of these devices, but all require the use of at leastone hand to hold the device to the throat. The choice ofwhich method to use depends on many things includingthe age and health of the laryngectomee, and whetherother parts of the mouth, such as the tongue, have alsobeen removed.\nMany patients resume daily activities after surgery.\nSpecial precautions must be taken during showering orshaving. Special instruction and equipment is alsorequired for those who wish to swim or water ski, as it isdangerous for water to enter the windpipe and lungsthrough the stoma.KEY TERMS\nLarynx —Also known as the voice box, the larynx\nis composed of cartilage that contains the appara-tus for voice production. This includes the vocalcords and the muscles and ligaments that movethe cords.\nLymph nodes —Accumulations of tissue along a\nlymph channel, which produce cells called lym-phocytes that fight infection.\nTracheostomy —A surgical procedure in which an\nartificial opening is made in the trachea (wind-pipe) to allow air into the lungs.Regular follow-up visits are important following\ntreatment for cancer of the larynx because there is a high-er-than-average risk of developing a new cancer in themouth, throat, or other regions of the head or neck. Manyself-help and support groups are available to helppatients meet others who face similar problems.\nRisks\nLaryngectomy is often successful in curing early\nstage cancers. However it does cause lifestyle changes.Laryngectomees must learn new ways of speaking. Theymust be continually concerned about the care of theirstoma. Serious infections can occur if water or other for-eign material enters the lungs through an unprotectedstoma. Also, women who undergo partial laryngectomyor who learn some types of artificial speech will have adeep voice similar to that of a man. For some women thispresents psychological challenges.\nNormal results\nIdeally, removal of the larynx will remove all cancer-\nous material. The person will recover from the operation,make lifestyle adjustments, and return to an active life.\nAbnormal results\nSometimes cancer has spread to surrounding tissues\nand it is necessary to remove lymph nodes, parts of thetongue, or other cancerous tissues. As with any majoroperation, post- surgical infection is possible. Infection isof particular concern to laryngectomees who have cho-sen to have a voice prosthesis implanted, and is one ofthe major reasons for having to remove the device.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMonahan, Frances.

    "title": "Laryngitis",
    "content": "Laryngitis\nDefinition\nLaryngitis is caused by inflammation of the larynx,\nresulting in hoarseness of the voice.\nDescription\nWhen air is breathed in (inspired), it passes through\nthe nose and the nasopharynx or through the mouth andthe oropharynx. These are both connected to the larynx, atube made of cartilage. The vocal cords, responsible forsetting up the vibrations necessary for speech, are locatedwithin the larynx. The air continues down the larynx tothe trachea. The trachea then splits into two branches, theleft and right bronchi (bronchial tubes). These bronchibranch into smaller air tubes which run within the lungs,leading to the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli).\nEither food, liquid, or air may be taken in through the\nmouth. While air goes into the larynx and the respiratorysystem, food and liquid are directed into the tube leadingto the stomach, the esophagus. Because food or liquid inthe bronchial tubes or lungs could cause a blockage orlead to an infection, the airway must be protected. Theepiglottis is a leaf-like piece of cartilage extendingupwards from the larynx. The epiglottis can close downover the larynx when someone is eating or drinking, pre-venting these substances from entering the airway.\nIn laryngitis, the tissues below the level of the\nepiglottis are swollen and inflamed. This causes swellingaround the area of the vocal cords, so that they cannotvibrate normally. A hoarse sound to the voice is verycharacteristic of laryngitis. Laryngitis is a very commonproblem, and often occurs during the course of an upperrespiratory tract infection (cold).\nCauses and symptoms\nLaryngitis is caused almost 100% of the time by a\nvirus. The same viruses which cause the majority of sim-ple upper respiratory infections (colds, etc.) are responsi-ble for laryngitis. These include parainfluenzae virus,influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus,\ncoronavirus, and echovirus. Extremely rarely, bacteriasuch as Group A streptococcus, M. catarrhalis, or thatwhich causes tuberculosis may cause laryngitis. In peo-\nple with faulty immune systems (particular due toacquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS ), infec-\ntions with fungi may be responsible for laryngitis.\nSymptoms usually begin along with, or following,\nsymptoms of a cold. A sore, scratchy throat, fever , runny\nnose, achiness, and fatigue may all occur. Difficulty swal-\nlowing sometimes occurs with streptococcal infections .\nThe patient may cough and wheeze. Most characteristically,\nthe patient’s voice will sound strained, hoarse, and raspy.\nIn extremely rare cases, the swelling of the larynx\nmay cause symptoms of airway obstruction. This is morecommon in infants, because the diameter of their airwaysis so small. In that case, the baby may have a greatlyincreased respiratory rate, and exhibit loud high-pitchedsounds with breathing (called stridor ).\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is usually made by learning the history of\na cold followed by hoarseness. The throat usuallyappears red and somewhat swollen. Listening to the chestand back with a stethoscope may reveal some harshwheezing sounds with inspiration (breathing in).\nIn long-standing (chronic laryngitis), tuberculosis\nmay be suspected. Using a scope called a laryngoscope,examination of the airway will show redness, swelling,small bumps of tissue called nodules, and irritated pits inthe tissue called ulcerations. Special skin testing (TBtesting) will reveal that the individual has been exposedto the bacteria causing TB.\nTreatment\nTreatment of a simple, viral laryngitis simply address-\nes the symptoms. Gargling with warm salt water, pain\nrelievers such as acetaminophen , the use of vaporizers to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1957Laryngitis\nAn endoscopic view of a patient’s vocal cords with laryngi-\ntis.(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)create moist air, and rest will help the illness resolve with-\nin a week.\nIn an infant who is clearly struggling for air, it may\nbe necessary to put in an artificial airway for a short peri-od of time. This is very rarely needed.\nAn individual with tubercular laryngitis is treated\nwith a combination of medications used to treat classicTB. In people with fungal laryngitis, a variety of anti-fungal medications are available.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments include aromatherapy\ninhalations made with benzoin, lavender, frankincense,thyme, and sandalwood. Decoctions (extracts made byboiling an herb in water) or infusions (extracts madeby steeping an herb in boiling water) can be made withred sage ( Salvia officinalis var. rubra ) and yarrow\n(Achillea millefolium ) or with licorice ( Glycyrrhiza\nglabra ). These are used for gargling, and are said to\nreduce pain. Echinacea (Echinacea spp.) tincture\ntaken in water every hour for 48 hours is recommendedto boost the immune system. Antiviral herbs, includingusnea ( Usnea spp.), lomatium ( Lomatium dissectum ),\nand ligusticum ( Ligusticum porteri ), may help hasten\nrecovery from laryngitis. Homeopathic remedies arerecommended based on the patient’s symptoms. Somepeople may get relief from placing cold compresses onthe throat.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis for laryngitis is excellent. Recovery is\ncomplete, and usually occurs within a week’s time.KEY TERMS\nEpiglottis —A leaf-like piece of cartilage extending\nupwards from the larynx, which can close like alid over the trachea to prevent the airway fromreceiving any food or liquid being swallowed.\nLarynx —The part of the airway lying between the\npharynx and the trachea.\nNasopharynx —The part of the airway into which\nthe nose leads.\nOropharynx —The part of the airway into which\nthe mouth leads.\nTrachea —The part of the airway which leads into\nthe bronchial tubes.Prevention\nPrevention of laryngitis is the same as for any upper\nrespiratory infections. The only way to even attempt toprevent such illnesses is by good handwashing, and byavoiding situations where one might come in contactwith people who might be sick. However, even with rela-tively good hygiene practices, most people will get aboutfive to six colds per year. It is unpredictable which ofthese may lead to laryngitis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDurand, Marlene, et al. “Laryngitis, Croup, and Epiglottitis.”\nIn Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

The\ndevice was initially used to treat diseases and disordersof the eye, whose transparent tissues gave ophthalmicsurgeons a clear view of how the narrow, concentratedbeam was being directed. Dermatologic surgeons alsohelped pioneer laser surgery, and developed andimproved upon many early techniques and more refinedsurgical procedures.\nTypes of lasers\nThe three types of lasers most often used in medical\ntreatment are the:\n• Carbon dioxide (CO\n2) laser. Primarily a surgical tool,\nthis device converts light energy to heat strong enoughto minimize bleeding while it cuts through or vaporizestissue.\n• Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser.\nCapable of penetrating tissue more deeply than otherlasers, the Nd:YAG makes blood clot quickly and canenable surgeons to see and work on parts of the body\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1959Laser surgerythat could otherwise be reached only through open\n(invasive) surgery.\n• Argon laser. This laser provides the limited penetration\nneeded for eye surgery and superficial skin disorders.In a special procedure known as photodynamic therapy(PDT), this laser uses light-sensitive dyes to shrink ordissolve tumors.\nLaser applications\nSometimes described as “scalpels of light,” lasers\nare used alone or with conventional surgical instrumentsin a diverse array of procedures that:\n• improve appearance\n• relieve pain\n• restore function\n• save lives\nLaser surgery is often standard operating procedure\nfor specialists in:\n• cardiology\n• dentistry\n• dermatology\n• gastroenterology (treatment of disorders of the stomach\nand intestines)\n• gynecology• neurosurgery• oncology ( cancer treatment)\n• ophthalmology (treatment of disorders of the eye)\n• orthopedics (treatment of disorders of bones, joints,\nmuscles, ligaments, and tendons)\n• otolaryngology (treatment of disorders of the ears,\nnose, and throat)\n• pulmonary care (treatment of disorders of the respirato-\nry system\n• urology (treatment of disorders of the urinary tract and\nof the male reproductive system)\nRoutine uses of lasers include erasing birthmarks ,\nskin discoloration, and skin changes due to aging , and\nremoving benign, precancerous, or cancerous tissues ortumors. Lasers are used to stop snoring , remove tonsils,\nremove or transplant hair, and relieve pain and restorefunction in patients who are too weak to undergo majorsurgery. Lasers are also used to treat:\n• angina (chest pain)\n• cancerous or non-cancerous tumors that cannot be\nremoved or destroyed\n• cold and canker sores , gum disease, and tooth sensitiv-\nity or decay• ectopic pregnancy (development of a fertilized egg\noutside the uterus)\n• endometriosis• fibroid tumors• gallstones• glaucoma, mild-to-moderate nearsightedness and astig-\nmatism , and other conditions that impair sight\n• migraine headaches• non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland• nosebleeds• ovarian cysts• ulcers• varicose veins• warts• and numerous other conditions, diseases, and disorders\nAdvantages of laser surgery\nOften referred to as “bloodless surgery,” laser proce-\ndures usually involve less bleeding than conventionalsurgery. The heat generated by the laser keeps the surgi-cal site free of germs and reduces the risk of infection.Because a smaller incision is required, laser proceduresoften take less time (and cost less money) than traditionalsurgery. Sealing off blood vessels and nerves reducesbleeding, swelling, scarring, pain, and the length of therecovery period.\nDisadvantages of laser surgery\nAlthough many laser surgeries can be performed in a\ndoctor’s office rather than in a hospital, the person guid-ing the laser must be at least as thoroughly trained andhighly skilled as someone performing the same proce-dure in a hospital setting. The American Society forLaser Medicine and Surgery, Inc. urges that:\n• all operative areas be equipped with oxygen and other\ndrugs and equipment required for cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR )\n• non-physicians performing laser procedures be proper-\nly trained, licensed, and insured\n• a qualified and experienced supervising physician be\nable to respond to and manage unanticipated events orother emergencies within five minutes of the time theyoccur\n• emergency transportation to a hospital or other acute-\ncare facility be available whenever laser surgery is per-formed in a non-hospital setting\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1960Laser surgeryImprecisely aimed lasers can burn or destroy healthy\ntissue.\nPreparation\nBecause laser surgery is used to treat so many dissim-\nilar conditions, the patient should ask his physician fordetailed instructions about how to prepare for a specificprocedure. Diet, activities, and medications may not haveto be limited prior to surgery, but some procedures requirea physical examination and a medical history that:\n• determines the patient’s general health and current\nmedical status\n• describes how the patient has responded to other ill-\nnesses, hospital stays, and diagnostic or therapeuticprocedures\n• clarifies what the patient expects the outcome of the\nprocedure to be\nAftercare\nMost laser surgeries can be performed on an outpa-\ntient basis, and patients are usually permitted to leave thehospital or medical office when their vital signs have sta-\nbilized. A patient who has been sedated should not bedischarged:\n• until he has recovered from the anesthesia and knows\nwho and where he is\n• unless he is accompanied by a responsible adult\nThe doctor may prescribe analgesic (pain-relieving)\nmedication, and should provide easy-to-understand writ-ten instructions that describe how the patient’s recoveryshould progress and what to do in case complications oremergency arise.\nRisks\nLike traditional surgery, laser surgery can be compli-\ncated by:\n• hemorrhage\n• infection\n• perforation (piercing) of an organ or tissue\nLaser surgery can also involve risks that are not\nassociated with traditional surgical procedures.

    "content": "Laxatives\nDefinition\nLaxatives are products that promote bowel movements.\nPurpose\nLaxatives are used to treat constipation—the passage\nof small amounts of hard, dry stools, usually fewer thanthree times a week. Before recommending use of laxa-tives, differential diagnosis should be performed. Pro-longed constipation may be evidence of a significant\nproblem, such as localized peritonitis or diverticulitis.\nComplaints of constipation may be associated with obses-\nsive-compulsive disorder . Use of laxatives should be\navoided in these cases. Patients should be aware that pat-terns of defecation are highly variable, and may vary fromtwo to three times daily to two to three times weekly.\nLaxatives may also be used prophylacticly for\npatients, such as those recovering from a myocardialinfarction or those who have had recent surgery, whoshould not strain during defecation.\nDescription\nLaxatives may be grouped by mechanism of action.\nSaline cathartics include dibasic sodium phosphate\n(Phospo-Soda), magnesium citrate, magnesium hydrox-ide (milk of magnesia), magnesium sulfate (Epsomsalts), sodium biphosphate, and others. They act byattracting and holding water in the intestinal lumen, andmay produce a watery stool. Magnesium sulfate is themost potent of the laxatives in this group.\nStimulant and irritant laxatives increase the peri-\nstaltic movement of the intestine. Examples include cas-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1963Laxativescara and bisadocyl (Dulcolax.) Castor oil works in a sim-\nilar fashion.\nBulk producing laxatives increase the volume of\nthe stool, and will both soften the stool and stimulateintestinal motility. Psyillium (Metamucil, Konsil) andmethylcellulose (Citrucel) are examples of this type.The overall effect is similar to that of eating high-fiberfoods, and this class of laxative is most suitable forregular use.\nDocusate (Colace) is the only representative exam-\nple of the stool softener class. It holds water within thefecal mass, providing a larger, softer stool. Docusate hasno effect on acute constipation, since it must be presentbefore the fecal mass forms to have any effect, but maybe useful for prevention of constipation in patients withrecurrent problems, or those who are about to take a con-stipating drug, such as narcotic analgesics .\nMineral oil is an emollient laxative. It acts by retard-\ning intestinal absorption of fecal water, thereby softeningthe stool.\nThe hyperosmotic laxatives are glycerin and lactu-\nlose (Chronulac, Duphalac), both of which act by hold-ing water within the intestine. Lactulose may alsoincrease peristaltic action of the intestine.\nRecommended dosage\nSee specific products.KEY TERMS\nCarbohydrates —Compounds, such as cellulose,\nsugar, and starch, that contain only carbon, hydro-gen, and oxygen, and are a major part of the diets ofpeople and other animals.\nCathartic colon — A poorly functioning colon, result-\ning from the chronic abuse of stimulant cathartics.\nColon —The large intestine.\nDiverticulitis —Inflammation of the part of the intes-\ntine known as the diverticulum.\nFiber —Carbohydrate material in food that cannot\nbe digested.\nHyperosmetic —Hypertonic, containing a higher\nconcentration of salts or other dissolved materialsthan normal tissues.\nOsteomalacia —A disease of adults, characterized\nby softening of the bone. Similar to Rickets which isseen in children.Pregnancy category — A system of classifying drugs\naccording to their established risks for use duringpregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studieshave demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B: Animalstudies indicate no fetal risk, but no human studies,or adverse effects in animals, but not in well-con-trolled human studies. Category C: No adequatehuman or animal studies, or adverse fetal effects inanimal studies, but no available human data. Cate-gory D: Evidence of fetal risk, but benefits outweighrisks. Category X: Evidence of fetal risk. Risks out-weigh any benefits.\nSteatorrhea — An excess of fat in the stool.\nStool —The solid waste that is left after food is\ndigested. Stool forms in the intestines and passesout of the body through the anus.\nPrecautions\nShort term use of laxatives is generally safe except\nin appendicitis , fecal impaction, or intestinal obstruc-\ntion. Lactulose is composed of two sugar molecules;galactose and fructose, and should not be administered topatients who require a low galactose diet.\nChronic use of laxatives may result in fluid and elec-\ntrolyte imbalances, steatorrhea, osteomalacia, diarrhea ,\ncathartic colon, and liver disease. Excessive intake ofmineral oil may cause impaired absorption of oil solublevitamins , particularly A and D. Excessive use of magne-\nsium salts may cause hypermanesemia.\nLactulose and magnesium sulfate are pregnancy\ncategory B. Casanthranol, cascara sagrada, danthron,docusate sodium, docusate calcium, docusate potassium,mineral oil and senna are category C. Casanthranol, cas-cara sagrada and danthron are excreted in breast milk,resulting in a potential increased incidence of diarrhea inthe nursing infant.\nInteractions\nMineral oil and docusate should not be used in com-\nbination. Docusate is an emulsifying agent which willincrease the absorption of mineral oil.\nBisacodyl tablets are enteric coated, and so should\nnot be used in combination with antacids .

    "title": "Lead poisoning",
    "content": "Lead poisoning\nDefinition\nLead poisoning occurs when a person swallows or\ninhales lead in any form. The result can be damage to thebrain, nerves, and many other parts of the body. Acutelead poisoning, which is relatively rare, occurs when alarge amount of lead is taken into the body over a shortperiod of time. Chronic lead poisoning, which is a com-mon problem in children, occurs when small amounts oflead are taken in over a longer period.\nDescription\nLead can damage almost every system in the human\nbody, and it can also cause high blood pressure ( hyper-\ntension ). It is particularly harmful to the developing\nbrain of fetuses and young children. The higher the levelof lead in a child’s blood, and the longer this elevatedlevel lasts, the greater the chance of ill effects. Over thelong term, lead poisoning in a child can lead to learningdisabilities, behavior problems, and even mental retar-\ndation . At very high levels, lead poisoning can cause\nseizures, coma , and even death .\nAbout one out of every six children in the United\nStates has a high level of lead in the blood, according tothe Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.Many of these children are exposed to lead through peel-ing paint in older homes. Others are exposed throughdust or soil that has been contaminated by old paint orpast emissions of leaded gasoline. Since childrenbetween the ages of 12-36 months are apt to put things intheir mouths, they are more likely than older children totake in lead. Pregnant women who come into contactwith lead can pass it along to the fetus.\nOver 80% of American homes built before 1978\nhave lead-based paint in them, according to the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The older thehome, the more likely it is to contain lead paint, and thehigher the concentration of lead in the paint is apt to be.Some homes also have lead in the water pipes or plumb-ing. People may have lead in the paint, dust, or soilaround their homes or in their drinking water withoutknowing it, since lead can’t be seen, smelled, or tasted.Because lead doesn’t break down naturally, it can contin-ue to cause problems until it is removed.\nCauses and symptoms\nBefore scientists knew how harmful it could be, lead\nwas widely used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, andmany other products. Today house paint is almost lead-free, gasoline is unleaded, and household plumbing is nolonger made with lead materials. Still, remnants of theold hazards remain. Following are some sources of leadexposure:\n• Lead-based paint. This is the most common source of\nexposure to large amounts of lead among preschoolers.Children may eat paint chips from older homes thathave fallen into disrepair. They may also chew on paint-ed surfaces such as windowsills. In addition, paint maybe disturbed during remodeling.\n• Dust and soil. These can be contaminated with lead\nfrom old paint or past emissions of leaded gasoline. Inaddition, pollution from operating or abandoned indus-trial sites and smelters can find its way into the soil,resulting in soil contamination.\n• Drinking water. Exposure may come from lead water\npipes, found in many homes built before 1930. Evennewer copper pipes may have lead solder. Also, somenew homes have brass faucets and fittings that canleach lead.\n• Jobs and hobbies. A number of activities can expose\nparticipants to lead. These include making pottery orstained glass, refinishing furniture, doing home repairs,and using indoor firing ranges. When adults take part insuch activities, they may inadvertently expose childrento lead residue that is on their clothing or on scrapmaterials.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1965Lead poisoning• Food. Imported food cans often have lead solder. Also,\nlead is found in leaded crystal glassware and someimported or old ceramic dishes. In addition, food maybe contaminated by lead in the water or soil.\n• Folk medicines. Certain folk medicines (for example,\nalarcon, alkohl, azarcon, bali goli, coral, ghasard, greta,liga, pay-loo-ah, and rueda) and traditional cosmetics(kohl, for example) contain large amounts of lead.\nChronic lead poisoning\nNew evidence suggests that lead may be harmful to\nchildren even at low levels that were once thought to besafe, and the risk of damage rises as blood levels of leadincrease. The symptoms of chronic lead poisoning taketime to develop, however. Children can appear healthydespite having high levels of lead in their blood. Overtime, though, problems such as the following may arise:\n• learning disabilities\n• hyperactivity\n• mental retardation• slowed growth\n• hearing loss• headaches\nLead poisoning is also harmful to adults, in whom it\ncan cause high blood pressure, digestive problems, nervedisorders, memory loss, and muscle and joint pain. In addi-\ntion, it can lead to difficulties during pregnancy , as well as\ncause reproductive problems in both men and women.\nAcute lead poisoning\nAcute lead poisoning, while less common, shows up\nmore quickly and can be fatal. Symptoms such as the fol-lowing may occur:\n• severe abdominal pain\n• diarrhea• nausea and vomiting• weakness of the limbs\n• seizures\n• coma\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1966Lead poisoningAirborne lead\nPeeling \nlead paintPeeling \nlead paint\nLead from soilLead \nsoldered cansLead in water\nLead crystalLead-glazed pottery\nLead painted toy\nContinuous exposure to lead can damage nearly every system in the human body and is particularly harmful to the develop-\ning brain of fetuses and young children. Common sources of lead exposure include lead-based paint, dust and soil, drinkingwater, food from cans, and eating utensils, such as plates and drinking glasses, that are lead-based. (Illustration by Electronic\nIllustrators Group.)Diagnosis\nA high level of lead in the blood can be detected\nwith a simple blood test. In fact, testing is the only wayto know for sure if children without symptoms have beenexposed to lead, since they can appear healthy even aslong-term damage occurs. The CDC recommends testingall children at 12 months of age and, if possible, again at24 months. Testing should start at six months for childrenat risk for lead poisoning. Based on these test results anda child’s risk factors, the doctor will then decide whetherfurther testing is needed and how often. In some states,more frequent testing is required by law.\nChildren at risk\nChildren with an increased risk of lead poisoning\ninclude those who:\n• live in or regularly visit a house built before 1978 in\nwhich chipped or peeling paint is present\n• live in or regularly visit a house that was built before\n1978 where remodeling is planned or underway\n• have a brother or sister, housemate, or playmate who\nhas been diagnosed with lead poisoning\n• live with an adult whose job or hobby involves expo-\nsure to lead\n• live near an active lead smelter, battery-recycling plant,\nor other industry that can create lead pollution\nAdults at risk\nTesting is also important for adults whose job or\nhobby puts them at risk for lead poisoning. This includespeople who take part in the following activities:\n• glazed pottery or stained glass making• furniture refinishing\n• home renovation\n• target shooting at indoor firing ranges• battery reclamation• precious metal refining\n• radiator repair\n• art restoration\nTreatment\nThe first step in treating lead poisoning is to avoid\nfurther contact with lead. For adults, this usually meansmaking changes at work or in hobbies. For children, itmeans finding and removing sources of lead in the home.In most states, the public health department can helpassess the home and identify lead sources.KEY TERMS\nChelation therapy —Treatment with chemicals that\nbind to a poisonous metal and help the body passit in urine at a faster rate.\nDimercaprol (BAL) —A chemical agent used to\nremove excess lead from the body.\nEdetate calcium disodium (EDTA calcium) —A\nchemical agent used to remove excess lead fromthe body.\nPenicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) —A drug used\nto treat medical problems (such as excess copperin the body and rheumatoid arthritis) and to pre-vent kidney stones. It is also sometimes prescribedto remove excess lead from the body.\nSuccimer (Chemet) —A drug used to remove\nexcess lead from the body.\nIf the problem is lead paint, a professional with spe-\ncial training should remove it. This is not a do-it-yourselfproject. Scraping or sanding lead paint creates largeamounts of dust that can poison people in the home. Thisdust can stay around long after the work is completed. Inaddition, heating lead paint can release lead into the air.For these reasons, lead paint should only be removed bysomeone who knows how to do the job safely and has theequipment to clean up thoroughly. Occupants, especiallychildren and pregnant women, should leave the homeuntil the cleanup is finished.\nChelation therapy\nIf blood levels of lead are high enough, the doctor\nmay also prescribe chelation therapy . This refers to\ntreatment with chemicals that bind to the lead and helpthe body pass it in urine at a faster rate. There are fourchemical agents that may be used for this purpose, eitheralone or in combination. Edetate calcium disodium(EDTA calcium) and dimercaprol (BAL) are giventhrough an intravenous line or in shots, while succimer(Chemet) and penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) aretaken by mouth. (Although many doctors prescribe peni-cillamine for lead poisoning, this use of the drug has notbeen approved by the Food and Drug Administration.)\nAlternative treatment\nChanges in diet are no substitute for medical treat-\nment. However, getting enough calcium, zinc, and pro-tein may help reduce the amount of lead the body\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1967Lead poisoningabsorbs. Iron is also important, since people who are\ndeficient in this nutrient absorb more lead. Garlic andthiamine, a B-complex vitamin, have been used to treatlead poisoning in animals. However, their usefulness inhumans for this purpose has not been proved. Nutrition-al, botanical, and homeopathic medicines can be admin-istered once the source is removed, to help correct anyimbalances brought on by lead toxicity.\nPrognosis\nIf acute lead poisoning reaches the stage of seizures\nand coma, there is a high risk of death. Even if the personsurvives, there is a good chance of permanent brain dam-age. The long-term effects of lower levels of lead canalso be permanent and severe. However, if chronic leadpoisoning is caught early, these negative effects can belimited by reducing future exposure to lead and gettingproper medical treatment.\nPrevention\nMany cases of lead poisoning can be prevented.\nThese steps can help:\n• Keep the areas where children play as clean and dust-\nfree as possible.\n• Wash pacifiers and bottles when they fall to the floor,\nand wash stuffed animals and toys often.\n• Make sure children wash their hands before meals and\nat bedtime.\n• Mop floors and wipe windowsills and other chewable\nsurfaces, such as cribs, twice a week with a solution ofpowdered dishwasher detergent in warm water.\n• Plant bushes next to an older home with painted exteri-\nor walls to keep children at a distance.\n• Plant grass or another ground cover in soil that is likely\nto be contaminated, such as soil around a home builtbefore 1960 or located near a major highway.\n• Have household tap water tested to find out if it con-\ntains lead.\n• Use only water from the cold-water tap for drinking,\ncooking, and making baby formula, since hot water islikely to contain higher levels of lead.\n• If the cold water hasn’t been used for six hours or more,\nrun it for several seconds, until it becomes as cold as itwill get, before using it for drinking or cooking. Themore time water has been sitting in the pipes, the morelead it may contain.\n• If you work with lead in your job or hobby, change your\nclothes before you go home.• Do not store food in open cans, especially imported cans.\n• Do not store or serve food in pottery meant for decora-\ntive use.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

    "content": "Learning disorders\nDefinition\nLearning disorders are academic difficulties experi-\nenced by children and adults of average to above-averageintelligence. People with learning disorders have difficul-ty with reading, writing, mathematics, or a combinationof the three. These difficulties significantly interfere withacademic achievement or daily living.\nDescription\nLearning disorders, or disabilities, affect approxi-\nmately 2 million children between the ages of 6-17 (5%\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1968Learning disordersof public school children). These children have specific\nimpairments in acquiring, retaining, and processinginformation. Standardized tests place them well belowtheir IQ range in their area of difficulty. The three maintypes of learning disorders are reading disorders, mathe-matics disorders, and disorders of written expression.\nReading disorders\nReading disorders are the most common type of\nlearning disorder. Children with reading disorders havedifficulty recognizing and interpreting letters and words(dyslexia ). They aren’t able to recognize and decode the\nsounds and syllables (phonetic structure) behind writtenwords and language in general. This condition lowersaccuracy and comprehension in reading.\nMathematics disorders\nChildren with mathematics disorders (dyscalculia)\nhave problems recognizing and counting numbers cor-rectly. They have difficulty using numbers in everydaysettings. Mathematics disorders are typically diagnosedin the first few years of elementary school when formalteaching of numbers and basic math concepts begins.Children with mathematics disorders usually have a co-existing reading disorder, a disorder of written expres-sion, or both.\nDisorders of written expression\nDisorders of written expression typically occur in\ncombination with reading disorders or mathematics dis-orders or both. The condition is characterized by difficul-ty with written compositions (dysgraphia). Children withthis type of learning disorder have problems withspelling, punctuation, grammar, and organizing theirthoughts in writing.\nCauses and symptoms\nLearning disorders are thought to be caused by neu-\nrological abnormalities that trigger impairments in theregions of the brain that control visual and language pro-cessing and attention and planning. These traits may begenetically linked. Children from families with a historyof learning disorders are more likely to develop disordersthemselves. Learning difficulties may also be caused bymedical conditions such as a traumatic brain injury orbrain infections such as encephalitis or meningitis .\nThe defining symptom of a learning disorder is aca-\ndemic performance that is markedly below a child’s ageand grade capabilities and measured IQ. Children with areading disorder may confuse or transpose words or let-ters and omit or add syllables to words. The writtenhomework of children with disorders of written expres-\nsion is filled with grammatical, spelling, punctuation,and organizational errors. The child’s handwriting isoften extremely poor. Children with mathematical disor-ders are often unable to count in the correct sequence, toname numbers, and to understand numerical concepts.\nDiagnosis\nProblems with vision or hearing, mental disorders\n(depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ),\nmental retardation , cultural and language differences,\nand inadequate teaching may be mistaken for learningdisorders or complicate a diagnosis. A comprehensivemedical, psychological, and educational assessment iscritical to making a clear and correct diagnosis.\nA child thought to have a learning disorder should\nundergo a complete medical examination to rule out anorganic cause. If none is found, a psychoeducationalassessment should be performed by a psychologist, psy-chiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or learning spe-cialist. A complete medical, family, social, and educa-tional history is compiled from existing medical andschool records and from interviews with the child and thechild’s parents and teachers. A series of written and ver-bal tests are then given to the child to evaluate his or hercognitive and intellectual functioning. Commonly usedtests include the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children(WISC-III), the Woodcock-Johnson PsychoeducationalBattery, the Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised (PIAT-R) and the California Verbal LearningTest (CVLT). Federal legislation mandates that this test-ing is free of charge within the public school system.\nTreatment\nOnce a learning disorder has been diagnosed, an\nindividual education plan (IEP) is developed for the childin question. IEPs are based on psychoeducational testfindings. They provide for annual retesting to measure achild’s progress. Learning-disordered students mayreceive special instruction within a regular general edu-cation class or they may be taught in a special educationor learning center for a portion of the day.\nCommon strategies for the treatment of reading dis-\norders focus first on improving a child’s recognition ofthe sounds of letters and language through phonics train-ing. Later strategies focus on comprehension, retention,and study skills. Students with disorders of writtenexpression are often encouraged to keep journals and towrite with a computer keyboard instead of a pencil.Instruction for students with mathematical disordersemphasizes real-world uses of math, such as balancing acheckbook or comparing prices.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1969Learning disordersPrognosis\nThe high school dropout rate for children with learn-\ning disabilities is almost 40%. Children with learning dis-abilities that go undiagnosed or are improperly treatedmay never achieve functional literacy. They often developserious behavior problems as a result of their frustrationwith school. The key to helping these students reach theirfullest potential is early detection and the implementationof an appropriate individualized education plan. Theprognosis is good for a large percentage of children withreading disorders that are identified and treated early.Learning disorders continue into adulthood, but withproper educational and vocational training, an individualcan complete college and pursue a challenging career.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

    "title": "Leeches",
    "content": "Leeches\nDefinition\nLeeches are bloodsucking worms with segmented\nbodies. They belong to the same large classification ofworms as earthworms and certain oceanic worms.\nLeeches can primarily be found in freshwater lakes,\nponds, or rivers. They range in size from 0.2 in (5 mm) tonearly 18 in (45 cm) and have two characteristic suckerslocated at either end of their bodies. Leeches consumethe blood of a wide variety of animal hosts, ranging fromfish to humans. To feed, a leech first attaches itself to thehost using the suckers. One of these suckers surroundsthe leech’s mouth, which contains three sets of jaws thatbite into the host’s flesh, making a Y-shaped incision. Asthe leech begins to feed, its saliva releases chemicals thatdilate blood vessels, thin the blood, and deaden the pain\nof the bite. Because of the saliva’s effects, a person bittenby a leech may not even be aware of it until afterwards,when he or she sees the incision and the trickle of bloodthat is difficult to stop.\nFor centuries, leeches were a common tool of doc-\ntors, who believed that many diseases were the result of“imbalances” in the body that could be stabilized byreleasing blood. For example, leeches were sometimesattached to veins in the temples to treat headaches.Advances in medical knowledge led doctors to abandonbloodletting and the use of leeches in the mid-nineteenthcentury. In recent years, however, doctors have found anew purpose for leeches—helping to restore blood circu-lation to grafted or severely injured tissue.\nPurpose\nThere are many occasions in medicine, mostly in\nsurgery and trauma care, when blood accumulates andcauses trouble. Leeches can be used to reduce theswelling of any tissue that is holding too much blood.This problem is most likely to occur in two situations:\n• Trauma. Large blood clots resulting from trauma can\nthreaten tissue survival by their size and pressure.Blood clots can also obstruct the patient’s airway.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1970Leeches• Surgical procedures involving reattachment of severed\nbody parts or tissue reconstruction following burns . In\nthese situations it is difficult for the surgeon to make aroute for blood to leave the affected part and return tothe circulation. The hardest part of reattaching severedextremities like fingers, toes and ears is to reconnect thetiny veins. If the veins are not reconnected, blood willaccumulate in the injured area. A similar situationoccurs when plastic surgeons move large flaps of skinto replace skin lost to burns, trauma or radical surgery.The skin flaps often drain blood poorly, get congested,and begin to die. Leeches have come to the rescue inboth situations.\nPrecautions\nIt is important to use only leeches that have been\nraised in the laboratory under sterile conditions in orderto protect patients from infection. Therapeutic leechesbelong to one of two species— Hirudo michaelseni or\nHirudo medicinalis .\nDescription\nOne or more leeches are applied to the swollen area,\ndepending on the size of the graft or injury, and left on forseveral hours. The benefits of the treatment lie not in theamount of blood that the leeches ingest, but in the anti-bloodclotting (anticoagulant) enzymes in the saliva thatallow blood to flow from the bite for up to six hours afterthe animal is detached, effectively draining away bloodthat could otherwise accumulate and cause tissue death .\nLeech saliva has been described as a better anticoagulantthan many currently available to treat strokes and heartattacks. Active investigation of the chemicals in leechsaliva is currently under way, and one anticoagulant drug,hirudin, is derived from the tissues of Hirudo medicinalis .\nAftercare\nThe leeches are removed by pulling them off or by\nloosening their grip with cocaine , heat, or acid. The used\nleeches are then killed by placing them in an alcoholsolution and disposed of as a biohazard. Proper care ofthe patient’s sore is important, as is monitoring the rate atwhich it bleeds after the leech is removed. Any clots thatform at the wound site during treatment should beremoved to ensure effective blood flow.\nRisks\nInfection is a constant possibility until the sore\nheals. It is also necessary to monitor the amount of bloodthat the leeches have removed from the patient, since adrop in red blood cell counts could occur in rare cases of\nprolonged bleeding.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nAdams, J.

The bacterial species\nresponsible for Legionnaires’ disease is L. pneumophila .\nMajor symptoms include fever , chills, muscle aches, and\na cough that is initially nonproductive. Definitive diag-\nnosis relies on specific laboratory tests for the bacteria,bacterial antigens, or antibodies produced by the body’sKEY TERMS\nAnemia —A blood disorder marked by low hemo-\nglobin levels in red blood cells, which leads to adeficiency of oxygen in the blood.\nAnticoagulant —A chemical or medication that\nprevents blood from clotting.immune system. As with other types of pneumonia,\nLegionnaires’ disease poses the greatest threat to peoplewho are elderly, ill, or immunocompromised.\nDescription\nLegionella bacteria were first identified as a cause of\npneumonia in 1976, following an outbreak of pneumoniaamong people who had attended an American Legionconvention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This epony-mous outbreak prompted further investigation intoLegionella and it was discovered that earlier unexplained\npneumonia outbreaks were linked to the bacteria. Theearliest cases of Legionnaires’ disease were shown tohave occurred in 1965, but samples of the bacteria existfrom 1947.\nExposure to the Legionella bacteria doesn’t neces-\nsarily lead to infection. According to some studies, anestimated 5-10% of the American population show sero-logic evidence of exposure, the majority of whom do notdevelop symptoms of an infection. Legionella bacteria\naccount for 2-15% of the total number of pneumoniacases requiring hospitalization in the United States.\nThere are at least 40 types of Legionella bacteria,\nhalf of which are capable of producing disease inhumans. A disease that arises from infection by Legionel-\nlabacteria is referred to as legionellosis. The L. pneu-\nmophila bacterium , the root cause of Legionnaires’ dis-\nease, causes 90% of legionellosis cases. The second mostcommon cause of legionellosis is the L. micdadei bac-\nterium, which produces the Philadelphia pneumonia-causing agent.\nApproximately 10,000-40,000 people in the United\nStates develop Legionnaires’ disease annually. The peo-ple who are the most likely to become ill are over age 50.The risk is greater for people who suffer from health con-ditions such as malignancy, diabetes, lung disease, orkidney disease. Other risk factors include immunosup-pressive therapy and cigarette smoking . Legionnaires’\ndisease has occurred in children, but typically it has beenconfined to newborns receiving respiratory therapy, chil-dren who have had recent operations, and children whoare immunosuppressed. People with HIV infection andAIDS do not seem to contract Legionnaires’ disease with\nany greater frequency than the rest of the population,however, if contracted, the disease is likely to be moresevere compared to other cases.\nCases of Legionnaires’ disease that occur in conjunc-\ntion with an outbreak, or epidemic, are more likely to bediagnosed quickly. Early diagnosis aids effective and suc-cessful treatment. During epidemic outbreaks, fatalitieshave ranged from 5% for previously healthy individuals\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1972Legionnaires’ diseaseto 24% for individuals with underlying illnesses. Sporadic\ncases (that is, cases unrelated to a wider outbreak) areharder to detect and treatment may be delayed pending anaccurate diagnosis. The overall fatality rate for sporadiccases ranges from 10-19%. The outlook is bleaker insevere cases that require respiratory support or dialysis. Insuch cases, fatality may reach 67%.\nCauses and symptoms\nLegionnaires’ disease is caused by inhaling\nLegionella bacteria from the environment. Typically, the\nbacteria are dispersed in aerosols of contaminated water.These aerosols are produced by devices in which warmwater can stagnate, such as air-conditioning cooling tow-ers, humidifiers, shower heads, and faucets. There havealso been cases linked to whirlpool spa baths and watermisters in grocery store produce departments. Aspirationof contaminated water is also a potential source of infec-tion, particularly in hospital-acquired cases of Legion-naires’ disease. There is no evidence of person-to-persontransmission of Legionnaires’ disease.\nOnce the bacteria are in the lungs, cellular represen-\ntatives of the body’s immune system (alveolarmacrophages) congregate to destroy the invaders. Thetypical macrophage defense is to phagocytose the invad-er and demolish it in a process analogous to swallowingand digesting it. However, the Legionella bacteria sur-\nvive being phagocytosed. Instead of being destroyedwithin the macrophage, they grow and replicate, eventu-ally killing the macrophage. When the macrophage dies,many new Legionella bacteria are released into the lungs\nand worsen the infection.\nLegionnaires’ disease develops two to 10 days after\nexposure to the bacteria. Early symptoms include lethar-gy, headaches, fever, chills, muscle aches, and a lack ofappetite. Respiratory symptoms such as coughing or con-gestion are usually absent. As the disease progresses, adry, hacking cough develops and may become productiveafter a few days. In about a third of Legionnaires’ diseasecases, blood is present in the sputum. Half of the peoplewho develop Legionnaires’ disease suffer shortness of\nbreath and a third complain of breathing-related chest\npain . The fever can become quite high, reaching 104°F\n(40°C) in many cases, and may be accompanied by adecreased heart rate.\nAlthough the pneumonia affects the lungs, Legion-\nnaires’ disease is accompanied by symptoms that affectother areas of the body. About half the victims experi-ence diarrhea and a quarter have nausea and vomiting\nand abdominal pain. In about 10% of cases, acute renalfailure and scanty urine production accompany the dis-ease. Changes in mental status, such as disorientation,confusion, and hallucinations , also occur in about a\nquarter of cases.\nIn addition to Legionnaires’ disease, L. pneumophila\nlegionellosis also includes a milder disease, Pontiac fever.Unlike Legionnaires’ disease, Pontiac fever does notinvolve the lower respiratory tract. The symptoms usuallyappear within 36 hours of exposure and include fever,headache , muscle aches, and lethargy. Symptoms last\nonly a few days and medical intervention is not necessary.\nDiagnosis\nThe symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease are common\nto many types of pneumonia and diagnosis of sporadiccases can be difficult. The symptoms and chest x raysthat confirm a case of pneumonia are not useful in differ-entiating between Legionnaires’ disease and other pneu-monias. If a pneumonia case involves multisystem symp-toms, such as diarrhea and vomiting, and an initially drycough, laboratory tests are done to definitively identify L.\npneumophila as the cause of the infection.\nIf Legionnaires’ disease is suspected, several tests\nare available to reveal or indicate the presence of L.\npneumophila bacteria in the body. Since the immune sys-\ntem creates antibodies against infectious agents, examin-ing the blood for these indicators is a key test. The levelof immunoglobulins, or antibody molecules, in the bloodreveals the presence of infection. In microscopic exami-nation of the patient’s sputum, a fluorescent stain linkedto antibodies against L. pneumophila can uncover the\npresence of the bacteria. Other means of revealing thebacteria’s presence from patient sputum samples includeisolation of the organism on culture media or detection\nof the bacteria by DNA probe. Another test detects L.\npneumophila antigens in the urine.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1973Legionnaires’ disease\nA transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of\nLegionella pneumophila, the bacteria which causes Legion-\nnaires’ disease. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\npermission.)Treatment\nMost cases of Legionella pneumonia show improve-\nment within 12-48 hours of starting antibiotic therapy.The antibiotic of choice has been erythromycin, some-times paired with a second antibiotic, rifampin. Tetracy-cline, alone or with rifampin, is also used to treat Legion-naires’ disease, but has had more mixed success in com-parison to erythromycin. Other antibiotics that have\nbeen used successfully to combat Legionella include\ndoxycycline, clarithromycin, fluorinated quinolones, andtrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.\nThe type of antibiotic prescribed by the doctor\ndepends on several factors including the severity ofinfection, potential allergies , and interaction with previ-\nously prescribed drugs. For example, erythromycin inter-KEY TERMS\nAntibody —A molecule created by the immune\nsystem in response to the presence of an antigen.It serves to recognize the invader and help defendthe body from infection.\nAntigen —A molecule, such as a protein, which is\nassociated with a particular infectious agent.

Several drugs, such\nas penicillins and cephalosporins , are ineffective\nagainst the infection. Although they may be deadly to thebacteria in laboratory tests, their chemical structure pre-vents them from being absorbed into the areas of the lungwhere the bacteria are present.\nIn severe cases with complications, antibiotic therapy\nmay be joined by respiratory support. If renal failureoccurs, dialysis is required until renal function is recovered.\nPrognosis\nAppropriate medical treatment has a major impact on\nrecovery from Legionnaires’ disease. Outcome is alsolinked to the victim’s general health and absence of com-plications. If the patient survives the infection, recoveryfrom Legionnaires’ disease is complete. Similar to othertypes of pneumonia, severe cases of Legionnaires’ diseasemay cause scarring in the lung tissue as a result of theinfection. Renal failure, if it occurs, is reversible and renalfunction returns as the patient’s health improves. Occa-sionally, fatigue and weakness may linger for several\nmonths after the infection has been successfully treated.\nPrevention\nSince the bacteria thrive in warm stagnant water,\nregularly disinfecting ductwork, pipes, and other areasthat may serve as breeding areas is the best method forpreventing outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease. Most out-breaks of Legionnaires’ disease can be traced to specificpoints of exposure, such as hospitals, hotels, and otherplaces where people gather. Sporadic cases are harder todetermine and there is insufficient evidence to point toexposure in individual homes.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEdelstein, Paul H., and Richard D.

    "title": "Leishmaniasis",
    "content": "Leishmaniasis\nDefinition\nLeishmaniasis refers to several different illnesses\ncaused by infection with an organism called a protozoan.\nDescription\nProtozoa are considered to be the most simple\norganisms in the animal kingdom. They are all single-celled. The types of protozoa which cause leishmaniasisare carried by the blood-sucking sandfly. The sandfly isreferred to as the disease vector, simply meaning that theinfectious agent (the protozoan) is carried by the sandflyand passed on to other animals or humans in whom theprotozoan will set up residence and cause disease. Theanimal or human in which the protozoan then resides isreferred to as the host.\nOnce the protozoan is within the human host, the\nhuman’s immune system is activated to try to combat theinvader. Specialized immune cells called macrophageswork to swallow up the protozoa. Usually, this techniquekills a foreign invader, but these protozoa can survive andflourish within macrophages. The protozoa multiplywithin the macrophages, ultimately causing themacrophage to burst open. The protozoa are released,and take up residence within other neighboring cells.\nAt this point, the course of the disease caused by the\nprotozoa is dependent on the specific type of protozoa,and on the type of reaction the protozoa elicits from theimmune system. There are several types of protozoawhich cause leishmaniasis, and they cause different pat-terns of disease progression.\nAt any one time, about 20 million people throughout\nthe world are infected with leishmaniasis. While leish-maniasis exists as a disease in 88 countries around theglobe, some countries are hit harder than others. Theseinclude Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sudan, Afghanistan,Brazil, Iran, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. Other areaswhich harbor the causative protozoa include China,many countries throughout Africa, Mexico, Central andSouth America, Turkey, and Greece. Although less fre-quent, cases have occurred in the United States, in Texas.\nIn some areas of southern Europe, leishmaniasis is\nbecoming an important disease which infects people withweakened immune systems. In particular, individualswith acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) are\nat great risk of this infection.Causes and symptoms\nThere are a number of types of protozoa which can\ncause leishmaniasis. Each type exists in specific loca-tions, and there are different patterns to the kind of dis-ease each causes. The overall species name is Leishma-nia (commonly abbreviated L.). The specific typesinclude: L. Donovani, L. Infantum, L. Chagasi, L. Mexi-\ncana, L. Amazonensis, L. Tropica, L. Major, L. Aethiopi-ca, L. Brasiliensis, L. Guyaensis, L. Panamensis, L. Peru-viana. Some of the names are reflective of the locale in\nwhich the specific protozoa is most commonly found, orin which it was first discovered.\nLocalized cutaneous leishmaniasis\nThis type of disease occurs most commonly in\nChina, India, Asia Minor, Africa, the MediterraneanBasin, and Central America. It has occurred in an arearanging from northern Argentina all the way up to south-ern Texas. It is called different names in different loca-tions, including chiclero ulcer, bush yaws , uta, oriental\nsore, Aleppo boil, and Baghdad sore.\nThis is perhaps the least drastic type of disease\ncaused by any of the Leishmania. Several weeks ormonths after being bitten by an infected sandfly, the hostmay notice an itchy bump (lesion) on an arm, leg, orface. Lymph nodes in the area of this bump may beswollen. Within several months, the bump develops acrater (ulceration) in the center, with a raised, reddenedridge around it. There may be several of these lesionsnear each other, and they may spread into each other toform one large lesion. Although localized cutaneousleishmaniasis usually heals on its own, it may take aslong as year. A depressed, light-colored scar usuallyremains behind. Some lesions never heal, and mayinvade and destroy the tissue below. For example, lesionson the ears may slowly, but surely, invade and destroy thecartilage which supports the outer ear.\nDiffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis\nThis type of disease occurs most often in Ethiopia,\nBrazil, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela.\nThe lesions of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis are very\nsimilar to those of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis, exceptthey are spread all over the body. The body’s immune sys-tem apparently fails to battle the protozoa, which are free tospread throughout. The characteristic lesions resemble thoseof the dread biblical disease, leprosy .\nMucocutaneous leishmaniasis\nThis form of leishmaniasis occurs primarily in the\ntropics of South America. The disease begins with the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1975Leishmaniasissame sores noted in localized cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nSometimes these primary lesions heal, other times theyspread and become larger. Some years after the firstlesion is noted (and sometimes several years after thatlesion has totally healed), new lesions appear in themouth and nose, and occasionally in the area between thegenitalia and the anus (the perineum). These new lesionsare particularly destructive and painful. They erodeunderlying tissue and cartilage, frequently eating throughthe septum (the cartilage which separates the two nos-trils). If the lesions spread to the roof of the mouth andthe larynx (the part of the wind pipe which contains thevocal cords), they may prevent speech. Other symptomsinclude fever , weight loss, anemia (low red blood cell\ncount). There is always a large danger of bacteria infect-ing the already open sores.\nVisceral leishmaniasis\nThis type of leishmaniasis occurs India, China, the\nsouthern region of Russia, and throughout Africa, theMediterranean, and South and Central America. It is fre-quently called Kala-Azar or Dumdum fever.\nIn this disease, the protozoa uses the bloodstream to\ntravel to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone mar-row. Fever may last for as long as eight weeks, disappear,and then reappear again. The lymph nodes, spleen, andliver are often quite enlarged. Weakness, fatigue , loss of\nappetite, diarrhea , and weight loss are common. Kala-\nazar translates to mean “black fever.” The name kala-azarcomes from a characteristic of this form of leishmaniasis.Individual with light-colored skin take on a darker, gray-ish skin tone, particularly of their face and hands. A vari-ety of lesions appear on the skin.Diagnosis\nDiagnosis for each of these types of leishmaniasis\ninvolves taking a scraping from a lesion, preparing it in alaboratory, and examining it under a microscope todemonstrate the causative protozoan. Other methods thathave been used include culturing a sample piece of tissuein a laboratory to allow the protozoa to multiply for easi-er microscopic identification; injecting a mouse or ham-ster with a solution made of scrapings from a patient’slesion to see if the animal develops a leishmaniasis-likedisease; and demonstrating the presence in macrophagesof the characteristic-appearing protozoan, called Leish-man-Donovan bodies.\nIn some forms of leishmaniasis, a skin test (similar\nto that given for TB) may be used. In this test, a solutioncontaining a small bit of the protozoan antigen (cellmarkers which cause the human immune system to react)is injected or scratched into a patient’s skin. In a positivereaction, cells from the immune system will race to thisspot, causing a characteristic skin lesion. Not all forms ofleishmaniasis cause a positive skin test, however.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of choice for all forms of leishmaniasis\nis a type of drug containing the element antimony. Theseinclude sodium sitogluconate, and meglumin antimonate.When these types of drugs do not work, other medicationswith anti-protozoal activity are utilized, including ampho-tericin B, pentamidine, flagyl, and allopurinol.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for leishmaniasis is quite variable,\nand depends on the specific strain of infecting protozoan,as well as the individual patient’s immune systemresponse to infection. Localized cutaneous leishmaniasismay require no treatment. Although it may take manymonths, these lesions usually heal themselves complete-ly. Only rarely do these lesions fail to heal and becomemore destructive.\nDisseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis may smolder\non for years without treatment, ultimately causing death\nwhen the large, open lesions become infected with bacteria.\nMucocutaneous leishmaniasis is often relatively\nresistant to treatment. Untreated visceral leishmaniasishas a 90% death rate, but only a 10% death rate withtreatment.\nPrevention\nPrevention involves protecting against sandfly bites.\nInsect repellents used around homes, on clothing, on\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1976Leishmaniasis\nThis condition, also called an oriental sore, is caused by the\nbacterium L. tropica .(Photograph by Lester V.

In areas where leishmani-asis is very common, recommendations include clearingthe land of trees and brush for at least 984 ft (300 m)around all villages, and regularly spraying the area withinsecticides. Because rodents often carry the protozoanwhich causes leishmaniasis, careful rodent controlshould be practiced. Dogs, which also carry the proto-zoan, can be given a simple blood test and then eithertreated or put to sleep.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHerwaldt, Barbara. “Leishmaniasis.” In Harrison’s Principles\nof Internal Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Leprosy",
    "content": "Leprosy\nDefinition\nLeprosy is a slowly progressing bacterial infection\nthat affects the skin, peripheral nerves in the hands andfeet, and mucous membranes of the nose, throat, andeyes. Destruction of the nerve endings causes the theaffected areas to lose sensation. Occasionally, because ofthe loss of feeling, the fingers and toes become mutilatedand fall off, causing the deformities that are typicallyassociated with the disease.\nDescription\nLeprosy is also known as Hansen’s disease after G.\nA. Hansen who in 1878 identified the bacillus Mycobac-\nterium leprae that caused the disease.\nThe infection is characterized by abnormal changes\nof the skin. These changes, called lesions, are at first flatand red. Upon enlarging, they have irregular shapes and acharacteristic appearance. The lesions are typically dark-er in color around the edges with discolored pale centers.Because the organism grows best at lower temperaturesthe leprosy bacillus has a preference for the skin, themucous membranes and the nerves. Infection in anddestruction of the nerves leads to sensory loss. The loss\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1977Leprosyof sensation in the fingers and toes increases the risk of\ninjury. Inadequate care causes infection of open wounds .\nGangrene may also follow, causing body tissue to die\nand become deformed.\nBecause of the disabling deformities associated with\nit, leprosy has been considered one of the most dreadeddiseases since biblical times, though much of what wascalled leprosy in the Old Testament most likely was notthe same disease. Its victims were often shunned by thecommunity, kept at arm’s length, or sent to a lepercolony. Many people still have misconceptions about thedisease. Contrary to popular belief, it is not highly com-municable and is extremely slow to develop. Householdcontacts of most cases and the medical personnel caringfor Hansen’s disease patients are not at particular risk. Itis very curable, although the treatment is long-term,requiring multiple medications.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) puts the\nnumber of identified leprosy cases in the world, at thebeginning of 1997, at about 890,000. Seventy percent ofall cases are found in just three countries: India, Indone-sia, and Myanamar (Burma). The infection can beacquired, however, in the Western Hemisphere as well.Cases also occur in some areas of the Caribbean andeven in southern Texas and Louisiana.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe organism that causes leprosy is a rod-shaped\nbacterium called Mycobacterium leprae . This bacterium\nis related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causative\nagent of tuberculosis . Because special staining tech-\nniques involving acids are required to view these bacteriaunder the microscope, they are referred to as acid-fastbacilli (AFB).\nWhen Mycobacterium leprae invades the body, one\nof two reactions can take place. In tuberculoid leprosy(TT), the milder form of the disease, the body’s immunecells attempt to seal off the infection from the rest of thebody by surrounding the offending pathogen. Becausethis response by the immune system occurs in the deeperlayers of the skin, the hair follicles, sweat glands, andnerves can be destroyed. As a result, the skin becomesdry and discolored and loses its sensitivity. Involvementof nerves on the face, arms, or legs can cause them toenlarge and become easily felt by the doctor. This findingis highly suggestive of TT. The scarcity of bacteria in thistype of leprosy leads to it being referred to as paucibacil-lary (PB) leprosy. Seventy to eighty percent of all leprosycases are of the tuberculoid type.\nIn lepromatous (LL) leprosy, which is the second\nand more contagious form of the disease, the body’simmune system is unable to mount a strong response to\nthe invading organism. Hence, the organism multipliesfreely in the skin. This type of leprosy is also called themultibacillary (MB) leprosy, because of the presence oflarge numbers of bacteria. The characteristic feature ofthis disease is the appearance of large nodules or lesionsall over the body and face. Occasionally, the mucousmembranes of the eyes, nose, and throat may beinvolved. Facial involvement can produce a lion-likeappearance (leonine facies). This type of leprosy can leadto blindness, drastic change in voice, or mutilation of thenose. Leprosy can strike anyone; however, children seemto be more susceptible than adults.\nWell-defined skin lesions that are numb are the first\nsymptoms of tuberculoid leprosy. Lepromatous leprosyis characterized by a chronic stuffy nose due to invasionof the mucous membranes, and the presence of nodulesand lesions all over the body and face.\nThe incubation period varies anywhere from six\nmonths to ten years. On an average, it takes four yearsfor the symptoms of tuberculoid leprosy to develop.Probably because of the slow growth of the bacillus, lep-romatous leprosy develops even more slowly, taking anaverage of eight years for the initial lesions to appear.\nIt is not very clear how the leprosy bacillus is trans-\nmitted from person to person. Inhaling bacteria that arepresent in dust is thought to be one of the modes of trans-mission. However, even among people who live in thesame household as the patient and are in close contact,only 5% get leprosy. It is obviously not a highly commu-nicable disease. The incidence of leprosy is highest in thepoverty belt of the globe. Therefore, environmental fac-tors such as unhygienic living conditions, overpopula-tion, and malnutrition may also be contributing factors\nfavoring the infection. The nine-banded armadillo is sus-ceptible to this disease but it is still unclear if humaninfection is related to exposure to this animal.\nDiagnosis\nOne of the hallmarks of leprosy is the presence of\nAFB in smears taken from the skin lesions, nasal scrap-ings, or tissue secretions. In patients with LL leprosy, thebacilli are easily detected; however, in TT leprosy thebacteria are very few and almost impossible to find. Insuch cases, a diagnosis is made based on the clinicalsigns and symptoms, the type and distribution of skinlesions, and history of having lived in an endemic area.\nThe signs and symptoms characteristic of leprosy\ncan be easily identified by a health worker after a shorttraining period. There is no need for a laboratory investi-gation to confirm a leprosy diagnosis, except in very rarecircumstances.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1978LeprosyIn an endemic area, if smears from an individual\nshow the presence of AFB, or if he has typical skinlesions, he should definitely be regarded as having lep-rosy. Usually, there is slight discoloration of the skin andloss of skin sensitivity. Thickened nerves accompaniedby weakness of muscles supplied by the affected nerveare very typical of the disease. One characteristic occur-rence is a foot drop where the foot cannot be flexedupwards, affecting the ability to walk.\nTreatment\nThe most widely used drug for leprosy is dapsone.\nHowever, emergence of dapsone-resistant strains prompt-ed the introduction of multi-drug therapy. The multi-drugtherapy includes dapsone, refampin (also known asrifampicin), and clofazimine, all of which are powerfulantibacterial drugs. Patients with MB leprosy are usuallytreated with all three drugs, while patients with PB lep-rosy are only given refampin and dapsone. Usually threemonths after starting treatment, a patient ceases beinginfectious, though not everyone with this disease is neces-sarily infectious before treatment. Depending on the typeof leprosy, the time required for treatment may vary fromsix months to two years or more.\nEach of the drugs have minor side effects. Dapsone\ncan cause nausea, dizziness ,palpitations ,jaundice and\nrash. A doctor should be contacted immediately if a rashdevelops. Dapsone also interacts with the second drug,refampin. Refampin increases the metabolizing of dap-sone in the body, requiring an adjustment of the dapsonedosage. Refampin may also cause muscle cramps, or nau-sea. If jaundice, flu-like symptoms or a rash appear, adoctor should be contacted immediately. The third drug,clofazimine may cause severe abdominal pain and diar-\nrhea , as well as discoloration of the skin. Red to brown-\nish black discoloration of the skin and bodily fluids,including sweat, may persist for months to years after use.\nThalidomide, the most famous agent of birth\ndefects in the 20th century, is now being used to treat\ncomplications of leprosy and similar diseases. Thalido-mide regulates the immune response by suppressing aprotein, tumor necrossi factor alpha.\nLeprosy patients should be aware that treatment\nitself can cause a potentially serious immune systemresponse called a lepra reaction. When antibiotics kill\nM. leprae, antigens (the proteins on the surface of the\norganism that initiate the body’s immune systemresponse) are released from the dying bacteria. In somepeople, when the antigens combine with the antibodies toM. Leprae in the bloodstream, a reaction called erythe-\nma nodosum leprosum may occur, resulting in new\nlesions and peripheral nerve damage. Cortisone-typemedications and, increasingly, thalidomide are used to\nminimize the effects of lepra reactions.\nPrognosis\nLeprosy is curable; however, the deformities and\nnerve damage associated with leprosy are often irre-versible. Preventions or rehabilition of these defects is anintegral part of management of the disease. Reconstruc-tive surgery, aimed at preventing and correcting deformi-ties, offers the greatest hope for disabled patients. Some-times, the deformities are such that the patients will notbenefit from this type of surgery.\nComprehensive care involves teaching patients to\ncare for themselves. If the patients have significant nervedamage or are at high risk of developing deformities,they must be taught to take care of their insensitivelimbs, similar to diabetics with lower leg nerve damage.Lacking the sensation of pain, the patients should con-stantly check themselves to identify cuts and bruises . If\nadequate care is not taken, these wounds become fester-ing sores and a source of dangerous infection. Physio-therapy exercises are taught to the patients to maintain arange of movement in finger joints and prevent the defor-mities from worsening. Prefabricated standardizedsplints are available and are extremely effective in cor-recting and preventing certain common deformities inleprosy. Special kinds of footwear have been designedfor patients with insensitive feet in order to prevent orminimize the progression of foot ulcers.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1979Leprosy\nLesions such as these are characteristic of leprosy. (Photo-\ntake NYC. Reproduced by permission.)Prevention\nBy early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of\ninfected individuals, even a disease as ancient as leprosycan be controlled. People who are in immediate contactwith the leprosy patient should be tested for leprosy.Annual examinations should also be conducted on thesepeople for a period of five years following their last con-tact with an infectious patient. Some physicians haveadvocated dapsone treatment for people in close house-hold contact with leprosy patients.\nThe WHO Action Program for the Elimination of\nLeprosy has adopted a resolution calling for the reduc-tion of leprosy’s prevalence to less than one case per10,000 people by the year 2000. In order to make thispossible, educating people about the disease and raisingtheir awareness is of utmost importance. The tuberculo-sis BCG vaccine, used in many areas of the world, mayhave an effect in decreasing the incidence of leprosy.KEY TERMS\nEndemic area —A geographical area where a par-\nticular disease is prevalent.\nGangrene —Death of tissue due to loss of blood\nsupply followed by bacterial invasion and putre-faction.\nIncubation period —The time it takes for symp-\ntoms to develop after initial exposure to a disease-causing organism.\nLesion —Any visible, local abnormality of the tissues\nof the skin, such as a wound, sore, rash, or boil.\nMucous membranes —The inner tissue that covers\nor lines body cavities or canals open to the out-side, such as nose and mouth.

    "content": "Leptospirosis\nDefinition\nLeptospirosis is a febrile disease ( fever ) caused by\ninfection with the bacteria Leptospira interrogans . The\ndisease can range from very mild and symptomless to amore serious, even life threatening form, that may beassociated with kidney (renal) failure.\nDescription\nAn infection by the bacterium Leptospira interro-\ngans goes by different names in different regions. Alter-\nnate names for leptospirosis include mud fever, swampfever, sugar cane fever, and Fort Bragg fever. Moresevere cases of leptospirosis are called Weil’s syndromeor icterohemorrhagic fever. This disease is commonlyfound in tropical and subtropical climates but occursworldwide.\nAs of the mid 1980s, there were 35-60 cases of lep-\ntospirosis reported in the United States each year. Most\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1980Leptospirosiscases occur in Hawaii, followed by the south Atlantic, Gulf,\nand Pacific coastal states. However, because of the nonspe-cific symptoms of leptospirosis, it is believed that theoccurrence in the United States is actually much higher.Leptospirosis occurs year-round in the United States, butabout half of the cases occur between July and October.\nLeptospirosis is a disease of animals and can be a\nvery serious problem in the livestock industry. Leptospira\nbacteria have been found in dogs, rats, livestock, mice,voles, rabbits, hedgehogs, skunks, possums, frogs, fish,snakes, and certain birds and insects. Infected animals willpass the bacteria in their urine for months, or even years.In the United States, rats and dogs are more commonlylinked with human leptospirosis than other animals.\nHumans are considered “accidental hosts” and\nbecome infected with Leptospira interrogans by coming\ninto contact with urine from infected animals. This iseither through direct contact with urine, or through con-tact with soil, water, or plants that have been contaminat-ed by animal urine. Leptospira interrogans can survive\nfor as long as six months outdoors under favorable con-ditions. Leptospira bacteria can enter the body throughcuts or other skin damage or through mucous membranes(such as the inside of the mouth and nose). It is believedthat the bacteria may be able to pass through intact skin,but this is not known.\nOnce past the skin barrier, the bacteria enter the\nblood stream and rapidly spread throughout the body.The infection causes damage to the inner lining of bloodvessels. The liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, central nervoussystem, and eyes may be affected.\nThere are two stages in the disease process. The first\nstage is during the active Leptospira infection and iscalled the “bacteremic,” or “septicemic,” phase. The bac-teremic phase lasts from three to seven days and presentsas typical flu-like symptoms. During this phase, bacteriacan be found in the patient’s blood and cerebrospinalfluid. The second stage, or “immune phase,” occurs eitherimmediately after the bacteremic stage or after a one tothree day symptom-free period. The immune phase canlast up to one month. During the immune phase, symp-toms are milder but meningitis (inflammation of spinal\ncord and brain tissues) is common. Bacteria can be isolat-ed only from the urine during this second phase.\nCauses and symptoms\nLeptospirosis is caused by an infection with the bac-\nterium Leptospira interrogans . The bacteria are spread\nthrough contact with urine from infected animals. Personsat an increased risk for leptospirosis include farmers, min-ers, animal health care workers, fish farmers and proces-sors, sewage and canal workers, cane harvesters, and sol-diers. High risk activities include care of pets, hunting,\ntrail biking, freshwater swimming, rafting, canoeing,kayaking, and participating in sports in muddy fields.\nSymptoms of Leptospira infection occur within\nseven to 12 days following exposure to the bacteria.Because the symptoms can be nonspecific, most peoplewho have antibodies to Leptospira do not remember hav-\ning had an illness. Eighty-five to 90% of the cases are notserious and clear up on their own. Symptoms of the firststage of leptospirosis last three to seven days and are:fever (100-105°F [37.8-40.6°C]), severe headache , mus-\ncle pain , stomach pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, back\npain, joint pain, neck stiffness, and extreme exhaustion.Cough and body rash sometimes occur.\nFollowing the first stage of disease, a brief symp-\ntom-free period occurs for most patients. The symptomsof the second stage vary in each patient. Most patientshave a low grade fever, headache, vomiting, and rash.Aseptic meningitis is common in the second stage,symptoms of which include headache and photosensitiv-\nity(sensitivity of the eye to light). Leptospira can affect\nthe eyes and make them cloudy and yellow to orange col-ored. Vision may be blurred.\nTen percent of the persons infected with Leptospira\ndevelop a serious disease called Weil’s syndrome. Thesymptoms of Weil’s syndrome are more severe thanthose described above and there is no distinction betweenthe first and second stages of disease. The hallmark ofWeil’s syndrome is liver, kidney, and blood vessel dis-ease. The signs of severe disease are apparent after threeto seven days of illness. In addition to those listed above,symptoms of Weil’s syndrome include jaundice (yellow\nskin and eyes), decreased or no urine output, hypoten-\nsion (low blood pressure), rash, anemia (decreased num-\nber of red blood cells), shock , and severe mental status\nchanges. Red spots on the skin, “blood shot” eyes, andbloody sputum signal that blood vessel damage and hem-orrhage have occurred.\nDiagnosis\nLeptospirosis can be diagnosed and treated by doc-\ntors who specialize in infectious diseases. During thebacteremic phase of the disease, the symptoms are rela-tively nonspecific. This often causes an initial misdiag-nosis because many diseases have similar symptoms toleptospirosis. The later symptoms of jaundice and kidneyfailure together with the bacteremic phase symptomssuggest leptospirosis. Blood samples will be tested tolook for antibodies to Leptospira interrogans . Blood\nsamples taken over a period of a few days would show anincrease in the number of antibodies. Isolating Leptospi-\nrabacteria from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (performed\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1981Leptospirosisby spinal tap), and urine samples is diagnostic of lep-\ntospirosis. It make take six weeks for Leptospira to grow\nin laboratory media. Most insurance companies wouldcover the diagnosis and treatment of this infection.\nTreatment\nLeptospirosis is treated with antibiotics , penicillin\n(Bicillin, Wycillin), doxycycline (Monodox), ibramycin,or erythromycin (E-mycin, Ery-Tab). As of early 1998,the timing of antibiotic treatment is controversial. It isgenerally agreed that antibiotic treatment during the firstfew days of illness is helpful. However, leptospirosis isoften not diagnosed until the later stages of illness. Thebenefit of antibiotic treatment in the later stages of dis-ease is controversial. A rare complication of antibiotictherapy for leptospirosis is the occurrence of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is characterized by fever,chills, headache, and muscle pain.\nPatients with severe illness will require hospitaliza-\ntion for treatment and monitoring. Medication or othertreatment for pain, fever, vomiting, fluid loss, bleeding,mental changes, and low blood pressure may be provid-ed. Patients with kidney failure will require hemodialysisto remove waste products from the blood.\nPrognosis\nThe majority of patients infected with Leptospira\ninterrogans experience a complete recovery. Ten percent\nof the patients will develop eye inflammation ( uveitis )\nup to one year after the illness. In the United States,about one out of every 100 patients will die from lep-tospirosis.

    "title": "Lesch-Nyhan syndrome",
    "content": "Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\nDefinition\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare genetic disorder\nthat affects males. Males with this syndrome developphysical handicaps, mental retardation , and kidney\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1982Lesch-Nyhan syndromeproblems. It is caused by a total absence of an enzyme.\nSelf injury is a classic feature of this genetic disease.\nDescription\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome was first described in 1964\nby Dr. Michael Lesch and Dr. William Nyhan. The syn-drome is caused by a severe change (mutation) in theHPRT gene. This gene is responsible for the productionthe enzyme called hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase(HPRT). HPRT catalyzes a reaction that is nec-essary to prevent the buildup of uric acid. A severe muta-tion in the HPRT gene leads to an absence of HPRTenzyme activity which, in turn, leads to markedly elevat-ed uric acid levels in the blood(hyperuricemia). Thisbuildup of uric acid is toxic to the body and is related tothe symptoms associated with the disease. Absence of theHPRT enzyme activity is also thought to alter the chem-istry of certain parts of the brain, such as the basal gan-glia, affecting neurotransmitters (chemicals used for com-munication between nerve cells), acids, and other chemi-cals. This change in the nervous system is also related tothe symptoms associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\nMales with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome develop neuro-\nlogic problems during infancy. Infants with Lesch-Nyhansyndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and areunable to develop normally. Affected males developuncontrollable writhing movements (athetosis) and mus-cle stiffness (spasticity) over time. Lack of speech is alsoa common feature of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The mostdramatic symptom of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is thecompulsive self-injury seen in 85% of affected males.This self injury involves the biting of their own lips,tongue, and finger tips, as well as head banging. Thisbehavior leads to serious injury and scarring.\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome affects approximately one\nin 380,000 live births. It occurs evenly among races.Almost always, only male children are affected. Womencarriers usually do not have any symptoms. Women car-riers can occasionally develop inflammation of the joints(gout)as they get older.\nCauses and symptoms\nSevere changes(mutations)in the HPRT gene com-\npletely halt the activity of the enzyme HPRT. There havebeen many different severe mutations identified in theHPRT gene. These mutations may be different betweenfamilies. The HPRT gene is located on the X chromo-some. Since the HPRT gene is located on the X chromo-some, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is considered X-liked.This means that it only affects males.\nA person’s sex is determined by their chromosomes.\nMales have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes.\nMales who possess a severe mutation in their HPRT genewill develop Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Females who pos-sess a severe mutation in their HPRT gene will not. Theyare considered to be carriers. This is because femaleshave another X chromosome without the mutation thatprevents them from getting this disease. If a woman is acarrier, she has a 50% risk with any pregnancy to pass\non her X chromosome with the mutation. Therefore, withevery male pregnancy she has a 50% risk to have anaffected son, and with every female pregnancy she has a50% risk to have a daughter who is a carrier.\nAt birth, males with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome appear\ncompletely normal. Development is usually normal forthe first few months. Symptoms develop between three tosix months of age. Sand-like crystals of uric acid in thediapers may be one of the first symptoms of the disease.The baby may be unusually irritable. Typically, the firstsign of nervous system impairment is the inability to lifttheir head or sit up at an appropriate age. Many patientswith Lesch-Nyhan will never learn to walk. By the end ofthe first year, writhing motions (athetosis), and spasmod-ic movements of the limbs and facial muscles (chorea)are clear evidence of defective motor development.\nThe compulsive self-injury associated with Lesch-\nNyhan syndrome begins, on average, at three years. Theself-injury begins with biting of the lips and tongue. Asthe disease progresses, affected individuals frequentlydevelop finger biting and head banging. The self-injurycan increase during times of stress .\nMales with Lesch-Nyhan disease may also develop\nkidney damage due to kidney stones . Swollen and tender\njoints(gout)is another common problem.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is based\ninitially on the distinctive pattern of symptoms. Measur-ing the amount of uric acid in a person’s blood or urinecan not definitively diagnose Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Itis diagnosed by measuring the activity of the HPRTenzyme through a blood test. When the activity of theenzyme is very low it is diagnostic of Lesch-Nyhan syn-drome. It can also be diagnosed by DNA testing. This isalso a blood test. DNA testing checks for changes (muta-tions) in the HPRT gene. Results from DNA testing arehelpful in making the diagnosis and also if the family isinterested in prenatal testing for future pregnancies.\nPrenatal diagnosis is possible by DNA testing of\nfetal tissue drawn by amniocentesis or chorionic villus\nsampling (CVS). Fetuses should be tested if the mother\nis a carrier of a change (mutation) in her HPRT gene. Awoman is at risk of being a carrier if she has a son with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1983Lesch-Nyhan syndromeLesch-Nyhan syndrome or someone in her family has\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome. Any woman at risk of being acarrier should have DNA testing through a blood test.\nTreatment\nThere are no known treatments for the neurological\ndefects of Lesch-Nyhan. The medication Allopurinol canlower blood uric acid levels. This medication does notcorrect many of the symptoms. Some patients withLesch-Nyhan syndrome have their teeth removed to pre-vent self-injury. Restraints are recommended to reduceself-destructive behaviors.\nPrognosis\nWith strong supportive care, infants born with\nLesch-Nyhan can live into adulthood with symptomscontinuing throughout life.\nAt present, there are no preventive measures for\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome. However, recent studies haveindicated that this genetic disorder may be a good candi-date for treatment with gene replacement therapy. Unfor-tunately, the technology necessary to implement thistherapy has not yet been perfected.\nResources\nBOOKS\nJinnah, H.A., and Theodore Friedmann. “Lesch-Nyhan Disease\nand Its Variants.” The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of\nInherited Disease.

Blood contains red cells, several varieties ofwhite cells, and platelets. Cancerous overproduction ofany one type of cell produces one of many types ofleukemia. A patient’s specific type of leukemia must beclassified in order to provide the best treatment and mostaccurate prognosis.\nThe type and maturity of the cells involved are iden-\ntified by analyzing blood and bone marrow under amicroscope. Often, however, the abnormality or immatu-rity of the cells make it difficult to identify the cell typeswith certainty. Special leukemia stains help to distinguishone cell type from another.\nDescription\nSpecial stains are added to bone marrow or blood\nthat has been smeared on a microscope slide. Cell typesreact differently to the chemicals in the stains.\nIf the patient has few white cells, a buffy coat smear is\nmade. A tube of blood is spun in a centrifuge. Red cells fall,plasma rises, and white cells settle in a thin middle layercalled the buffy coat. The smear is made from this layer.\nSudan black B stain\nThis stain distinguishes between acute lymphoblas-\ntic leukemia (cells stain positive) and acute myeloblasticleukemia (cells stain negative).\nPeriodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS)\nThe PAS stain is primarily used to identify ery-\nthroleukemia, a leukemia of immature red blood cells.These cells stain a bright fuchsia.\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase stain (TdT)\nThe TdT stain differentiates between acute lym-\nphoblastic leukemia (cells stain positive) and acute myel-ogenous leukemia (cells stain negative).\nLeukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP)\nThe LAP stain is used to determine if an increase of\ncells is due to chronic myelogenous leukemia or a non-cancerous reaction to an infection or similar conditions.Cells from a noncancerous reaction stain positive withmany intense blue granules; cells from chronic myeloge-nous leukemia have few blue granules.\nTartrate-resistant acid phosphatase \nstain (TRAP)\nThe TRAP stain is primarily used to identify hairy\ncell leukemia cells. These cells stain with purple to dark\nred granules.\nMyeloperoxidase stain\nThe myeloperoxidase stain distinguishes between\nthe immature cells in acute myeloblastic leukemia (cellsstain positive) and those in acute lymphoblastic leukemia(cells stain negative).\nLeukocyte specific esterase\nThis stain identifies granulocytes, which show red\ngranules.\nLeukocyte nonspecific esterase\nNonspecific esterase stain identifies monocytes and\nimmature platelets (megakaryocytes), which show posi-tive black granules.\nPreparation\nLeukemia stains are done on smears of blood or\nbone marrow. To collect blood, a healthcare workerdraws blood from a vein in the inner elbow region. Col-lection of the sample takes only a few minutes.\nWhen bone marrow is needed, the person is given\nlocal anesthesia. Then the physician inserts a needle\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1985Leukemia stains\nA magnified stain of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)through the skin and into the bone—usually the breast\nbone or hip bone—and 0.5-2 mL of bone marrow iswithdrawn. This procedure takes approximately 30minutes.\nAftercare\nPatients sometimes feel discomfort or bruising at the\npuncture site after blood collection. They may alsobecome dizzy or faint. Pressure to the puncture site untilthe bleeding stops reduces bruising. Warm packs to thepuncture site relieve discomfort.\nCollection of bone marrow is done under a physi-\ncian’s supervision. The patient is asked to rest after theprocedure and is watched for weakness and signs ofbleeding.\nNormal results\nA normal blood or bone marrow smear shows no\nevidence of leukemic cells. The expected reaction ofcells varies with the type of stain.\nAbnormal results\nLeukemia stain results that help diagnosis and clas-\nsify leukemia are supported by the results of other labo-ratory tests and the person’s clinical condition.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFischbach, Francis.

Depending on their characteristics, leukemias canbe divided into two broad types. Acute leukemias are therapidly progressing leukemias, while the chronicleukemias progress more slowly. The vast majority of thechildhood leukemias are of the acute form.\nDescription\nThe cells that make up blood are produced in the\nbone marrow and the lymph system. The bone marrow isthe spongy tissue found in the large bones of the body.The lymph system includes the spleen (an organ in theupper abdomen), the thymus (a small organ beneath thebreastbone), and the tonsils (an organ in the throat). Inaddition, the lymph vessels (tiny tubes that branch likeblood vessels into all parts of the body) and lymph nodes(pea-shaped organs that are found along the network oflymph vessels) are also part of the lymph system. Thelymph is a milky fluid that contains cells. Clusters oflymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, pelvis,abdomen, and chest.\nThe cells found in the blood are the red blood cells\n(RBCs), which carry oxygen and other materials to alltissues of the body; white blood cells (WBCs) that fightinfection; and the platelets, which play a part in the clot-ting of the blood. The white blood cells can be furthersubdivided into three main types: granulocytes, mono-cytes, and lymphocytes.\nThe granulocytes, as their name suggests, have parti-\ncles (granules) inside them. These granules contain spe-cial proteins (enzymes) and several other substances thatcan break down chemicals and destroy microorganisms,such as bacteria. Monocytes are the second type of whiteblood cell. They are also important in defending the bodyagainst pathogens.\nThe lymphocytes form the third type of white blood\ncell. There are two main types of lymphocytes: T lym-phocytes and B lymphocytes. They have different func-tions within the immune system. The B cells protect thebody by making “antibodies.” Antibodies are proteinsthat can attach to the surfaces of bacteria and viruses.This “attachment” sends signals to many other cell typesto come and destroy the antibody-coated organism. TheT cells protect the body against viruses. When a virusenters a cell, it produces certain proteins that are project-ed onto the surface of the infected cell. The T cells recog-nize these proteins and make certain chemicals that are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1986Leukemias, acutecapable of destroying the virus-infected cells. In addi-\ntion, the T cells can destroy some types of cancer cells.\nThe bone marrow makes stem cells, which are the\nprecursors of the different blood cells. These stem cellsmature through stages into either RBCs, WBCs, orplatelets. In acute leukemias, the maturation process ofthe white blood cells is interrupted. The immature cells(or “blasts”) proliferate rapidly and begin to accumulatein various organs and tissues, thereby affecting their nor-mal function. This uncontrolled proliferation of theimmature cells in the bone marrow affects the productionof the normal red blood cells and platelets as well.\nAcute leukemias are of two types: acute lymphocyt-\nic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia. Differenttypes of white blood cells are involved in the twoleukemias. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), it isthe T or the B lymphocytes that become cancerous. TheB cell leukemias are more common than T cellleukemias. Acute myelogenous leukemia, also known asacute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), is a cancer ofthe monocytes and/or granulocytes.\nLeukemias account for 2% of all cancers. Because\nleukemia is the most common form of childhood cancer,it is often regarded as a disease of childhood. However,leukemias affect nine times as many adults as children.Half of the cases occur in people who are 60 years of ageor older. The incidence of acute and chronic leukemias isabout the same. According to the estimates of the Ameri-can Cancer Society (ACS), approximately 29,000 newcases of leukemia will be diagnosed in 1998.\nCauses and symptoms\nLeukemia strikes both sexes and all ages. The\nhuman T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) is believed to bethe causative agent for some kinds of leukemias. Howev-er, the cause of most leukemias is not known. Acute lym-phoid leukemia (ALL) is more common among Cau-casians than among African-Americans, while acutemyeloid leukemia (AML) affects both races equally. Theincidence of acute leukemia is slightly higher amongmen than women. People with Jewish ancestry have ahigher likelihood of getting leukemia. A higher incidenceof leukemia has also been observed among persons withDown syndrome and some other genetic abnormalities.\nExposure to ionizing radiation and to certain organic\nchemicals, such as benzene, is believed to increase therisk of getting leukemia. Having a history of diseases thatdamage the bone marrow, such as aplastic anemia , or a\nhistory of cancers of the lymphatic system puts people ata high risk for developing acute leukemias. Similarly, theuse of anticancer medications, immunosuppressants, andthe antibiotic chloramphenicol are also considered risk\nfactors for developing acute leukemias.\nThe symptoms of leukemia are generally vague and\nnon-specific. A patient may experience all or some of thefollowing symptoms:\n• weakness or chronic fatigue\n• fever of unknown origin\n• weight loss that is not due to dieting or exercise\n• frequent bacterial or viral infections\n• headaches\n• skin rash\n• non-specific bone pain\n• easy bruising\n• bleeding from gums or nose\n• blood in urine or stools\n• enlarged lymph nodes and/or spleen\n• abdominal fullness\nDiagnosis\nLike all cancers, acute leukemias are best treated\nwhen found early. There are no screening tests available.\nIf the doctor has reason to suspect leukemia, he or\nshe will conduct a very thorough physical examination\nto look for enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, underarm,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1987Leukemias, acute\nAn enhanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nimage of acute myelogenous leukemia cells. (Photograph by\nRobert Becker, Ph.D., Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-duced by permission.)and pelvic region. Swollen gums, enlarged liver or\nspleen, bruises , or pinpoint red rashes all over the body\nare some of the signs of leukemia. Urine and blood testsmay be ordered to check for microscopic amounts ofblood in the urine and to obtain a complete differentialblood count . This count will give the numbers and per-\ncentages of the different cells found in the blood. Anabnormal blood test might suggest leukemia; however,the diagnosis has to be confirmed by more specific tests.\nThe doctor may perform a bone marrow biopsy to\nconfirm the diagnosis of leukemia. During the biopsy, acylindrical piece of bone and marrow is removed. Thetissue is generally taken out of the hipbone. These sam-ples are sent to the laboratory for examination. In addi-tion to diagnosis, the biopsy is also repeated during thetreatment phase of the disease to see if the leukemia isresponding to therapy.\nA spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is another procedure\nthat the doctor may order to diagnose leukemia. In thisprocedure, a small needle is inserted into the spinal cavi-ty in the lower back to withdraw some cerebrospinalfluid and to look for leukemic cells.\nStandard imaging tests, such as x rays, computed\ntomography scans (CT scans), and magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) may be used to check whether the\nleukemic cells have invaded other areas of the body, suchas the bones, chest, kidneys, abdomen, or brain. A galli-um scan or bone scan is a test in which a radioactivechemical is injected into the body. This chemical accu-\nmulates in the areas of cancer or infection, allowing themto be viewed with a special camera.\nTreatment\nThere are two phases of treatment for leukemia. The\nfirst phase is called “induction therapy.” As the name sug-gests, during this phase, the main aim of the treatment is toreduce the number of leukemic cells as far as possible andinduce a remission in the patient. Once the patient showsno obvious signs of leukemia (no leukemic cells are detect-ed in blood tests and bone marrow biopsies), the patient issaid to be in remission. The second phase of treatment isthen initiated. This is called continuation or maintenancetherapy, and the aim in this case is to kill any remainingcells and to maintain the remission for as long as possible.\nChemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer\ncells. It is usually the treatment of choice and is used torelieve symptoms and achieve long-term remission of thedisease. Generally, combination chemotherapy, in whichmultiple drugs are used, is more efficient than using asingle drug for the treatment. Some drugs may be admin-istered intravenously through a vein in the arm; othersmay be given by mouth in the form of pills. If the cancercells have invaded the brain, then chemotherapeuticdrugs may be put into the fluid that surrounds the brainthrough a needle in the brain or back. This is known asintrathecal chemotherapy.\nBecause leukemia cells can spread to all the organs\nvia the blood stream and the lymph vessels, surgery isnot considered an option for treating leukemias.\nRadiation therapy , which involves the use of x rays\nor other high-energy rays to kill cancer cells and shrinktumors, may be used in some cases. For acute leukemias,the source of radiation is usually outside the body (exter-nal radiation therapy). If the leukemic cells have spreadto the brain, radiation therapy can be given to the brain.\nBone marrow transplantation is a process in which\nthe patient’s diseased bone marrow is replaced withhealthy marrow. There are two ways of doing a bone mar-row transplant. In an allogeneic bone marrow transplant,healthy marrow is taken from a donor whose tissue iseither the same as or very closely resembles the patient’stissues. The donor may be a twin, a brother or sister (sib-ling), or a person who is not related at all. First, thepatient’s bone marrow is destroyed with very high dosesof chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Healthy marrowfrom the donor is then given to the patient through a nee-dle in a vein to replace the destroyed marrow.\nIn the second type of bone marrow transplant, called\nan autologous bone marrow transplant, some of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1988Leukemias, acute\nAn enhanced scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of\nacute myelogenous leukemia cells. (Photograph by Robert\nBecker, Ph.D., Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced bypermission.)patient’s own marrow is taken out and treated with a com-\nbination of anticancer drugs to kill all the abnormal cells.\nThis marrow is then frozen to save it. The marrow remain-ing in the patient’s body is destroyed with high-dosechemotherapy and radiation therapy. The marrow that wasfrozen is then thawed and given back to the patientthrough a needle in a vein. This mode of bone marrowtransplant is currently being investigated in clinical trials.\nBiological therapy or immunotherapy is a mode of\ntreatment in which the body’s own immune system isharnessed to fight the cancer. Substances that are routine-ly made by the immune system (such as growth factors,hormones, and disease-fighting proteins) are either syn-thetically made in a laboratory or their effectiveness isboosted and they are then put back into the patient’sbody. This treatment mode is also being investigated inclinical trials all over the country at major cancer centers.\nPrognosis\nLike all cancers, the prognosis for leukemia depends\non the patient’s age and general health. According to sta-tistics, more than 60% of the patients with leukemia sur-vive for at least a year after diagnosis. Acute myelocyticleukemia (AML) has a poorer prognosis rate than acutelymphocytic leukemias (ALL) and the chronic leukemias.In the last 15 to 20 years, the five-year survival rate forpatients with ALL has increased from 38% to 57%.KEY TERMS\nAntibodies —Proteins made by the B lymphocytes\nin response to the presence of infectious agents,such as bacteria or viruses, in the body.\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and microscopic\nexamination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.\nChemotherapy —Treatment with drugs that act\nagainst cancer.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan —A series of x\nrays put together by a computer in order to formdetailed pictures of areas inside the body.\nCytokines —Chemicals made by the cells that act\non other cells to stimulate or inhibit their function.Cytokines that stimulate growth are called “growthfactors.”\nImmunotherapy —Treatment of cancer by stimulat-\ning the body’s immune defense system.\nLumbar puncture —A procedure in which the doc-\ntor inserts a small needle into the spinal cavity inthe lower back to withdraw some spinal fluid for\ntesting.

This is becausechemotherapeutic drugs are most effective againstactively growing cells. Due to the new combinations ofanticancer drugs being used, the survival rates amongchildren with ALL have improved dramatically. Eightypercent of the children diagnosed with ALL now sur-vive for five years or more, as compared to 50% in thelate 1970s.\nPrevention\nMost cancers can be prevented by changes in\nlifestyle or diet, which will reduce the risk factors.However, in leukemias, there are no such known riskfactors. Therefore, at the present time, no way isknown to prevent leukemias from developing. Peoplewho are at an increased risk for developing leukemiabecause of proven exposure to ionizing radiation orexposure to the toxic liquid benzene, and people withDown syndrome, should undergo periodic medicalcheckups.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, ed., et al.

    "content": "Leukemias, chronic\nDefinition\nChronic leukemia is a disease in which too many\nwhite blood cells are made in the bone marrow. Depend-ing on the type of white blood cell that is involved,chronic leukemia can be classified as chronic lymphocyt-ic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia.\nDescription\nChronic leukemia is a cancer that starts in the blood\ncells made in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is thespongy tissue found in the large bones of the body. Thebone marrow makes precursor cells called “blasts” or“stem cells” that mature into different types of bloodcells. Unlike acute leukemias, in which the process ofmaturation of the blast cells is interrupted, in chronicleukemias, the cells do mature and only a few remain asimmature cells. However, even though the cells appearnormal, they do not function as normal cells.\nThe different types of cells that are produced in the\nbone marrow are red blood cells (RBCs), which carry oxy-gen and other materials to all tissues of the body; whiteblood cells (WBCs), which fight infection; and platelets,which play a part in the clotting of the blood. The whiteblood cells can be further subdivided into three maintypes: the granulocytes, monocytes, and the lymphocytes.The granulocytes, as their name suggests, have gran-\nules (particles) inside them. These granules contain spe-cial proteins (enzymes) and several other substances thatcan break down chemicals and destroy microorganismssuch as bacteria.\nMonocytes are the second type of white blood cell.\nThey are also important in defending the body againstpathogens.\nThe lymphocytes form the third type of white blood\ncell. There are two main types of lymphocytes: T lympho-cytes and B lymphocytes. They have different functionswithin the immune system. The B cells protect the bodyby making “antibodies.” Antibodies are proteins that canattach to the surfaces of bacteria and viruses. This attach-ment sends signals to many other cell types to come anddestroy the antibody-coated organism. The T cell protectsthe body against viruses. When a virus enters a cell, itproduces certain proteins that are projected onto the sur-face of the infected cell. The T cells can recognize theseproteins and produce certain chemicals (cytokines) thatare capable of destroying the virus-infected cells. In addi-tion, the T cells can destroy some types of cancer cells.\nChronic leukemias develop very gradually. The\nabnormal lymphocytes multiply slowly, but in a poorlyregulated manner. They live much longer and thus theirnumbers build up in the body. The two types of chronicleukemias can be easily distinguished under the micro-scope. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) involvesthe T or B lymphocytes. B cell abnormalities are morecommon than T cell abnormalities. T cells are affected inonly 5% of the patients. The T and B lymphocytes can bedifferentiated from the other types of white blood cellsbased on their size and by the absence of granules insidethem. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the cellsthat are affected are the granulocytes.\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often has no\nsymptoms at first and may remain undetected for a longtime. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), on theother hand, may progress to a more acute form.\nChronic leukemias account for 1.2% of all cancers.\nBecause leukemia is the most common form of childhoodcancer, it is often regarded as a disease of childhood.However, leukemias affect nine times as many adults aschildren. In chronic lymphoid leukemia, 90% of the casesare seen in people who are 50 years or older, with theaverage age at diagnosis being 65. The incidence of thedisease increases with age. It is almost never seen in chil-dren. Chronic myeloid leukemias are generally seen inpeople in their mid-40s. It accounts for about 4% of child-hood leukemia cases. According to the estimates of theAmerican Cancer Society (ACS), approximately 29,000new cases of leukemia will be diagnosed in 1998.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1990Leukemias, chronicCauses and symptoms\nLeukemia strikes both sexes and all ages. Although\nthe cause is unknown, chronic leukemia is linked togenetic abnormalities and environmental factors. Forexample, exposure to ionizing radiation and to certainorganic chemicals, such as benzene, is believed toincrease the risks for getting leukemia. Chronic leukemiaoccurs in some people who are infected with two humanretroviruses (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). An abnormal chro-mosome known as the Philadelphia chromosome is seenin 90% of those with CML. The incidence of chronicleukemia is slightly higher among men than women.\nThe symptoms of chronic leukemia are generally\nvague and non-specific. In chronic lymphoid leukemia(CLL), a patient may experience all or some of the fol-lowing symptoms:\n• swollen lymph nodes\n• an enlarged spleen, which could make the patient com-\nplain of abdominal fullness\n• chronic fatigue\n• a general feeling of ill-health• fever of unknown origin\n• night sweats\n• weight loss that is not due to dieting or exerciseKEY TERMS\nAntibodies —Proteins made by the B lymphocytes\nin response to the presence of infectious agents,such as bacteria or viruses, in the body.\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and microscopic\nexamination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.\nChemotherapy —Treatment with drugs that act\nagainst cancer.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan —A series of x\nrays put together by a computer in order to formdetailed pictures of areas inside the body.\nCytokines —Chemicals made by the cells that act\non other cells to stimulate or inhibit their function.Cytokines that stimulate growth are called “growthfactors.”\nImmunotherapy —Treatment of cancer by stimulat-\ning the body’s immune defense system.\nLumbar puncture —A procedure in which the doc-\ntor inserts a small needle into the spinal cavity inthe lower back to withdraw some spinal fluid for\ntesting.

Urine and\nblood tests may be ordered to check for microscopicamounts of blood in the urine and to obtain a completedifferential blood count . This count will give the num-\nbers and percentages of the different cells found in theblood. An abnormal blood test might suggest leukemia;however, the diagnosis has to be confirmed by morespecific tests.\nThe doctor may perform a bone marrow biopsy to\nconfirm the diagnosis of leukemia. During the bone mar-row biopsy, a cylindrical piece of bone and marrow isremoved. The tissue is generally taken out of the hip-bone. These samples are sent to the laboratory for exami-nation. In addition to diagnosis, bone marrow biopsy isalso done during the treatment phase of the disease to seeif the leukemia is responding to therapy.\nStandard imaging tests such as x rays, computed\ntomography scans (CT scans), and magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) may be used to check whether the\nleukemic cells have invaded other organs of the body,such as the bones, chest, kidneys, abdomen, or brain.\nTreatment\nThe treatment depends on the specific type of chron-\nic leukemia and its stage. In general, chemotherapy is\nthe standard approach to both CLL and CML. Radiation\ntherapy is occasionally used. Because leukemia cells\ncan spread to all the organs via the blood stream and thelymph vessels, surgery is not considered an option fortreating leukemias.\nBone marrow transplantation (BMT) is becoming\nthe treatment of choice for CML because it has the possi-bility of curing the illness. BMT is generally not consid-ered an option in treating CLL because CLL primarilyaffects older people, who are not considered to be goodcandidates for the procedure.\nIn BMT, the patient’s diseased bone marrow is\nreplaced with healthy marrow. There are two ways ofdoing a bone marrow transplant. In an allogeneic bonemarrow transplant, healthy marrow is taken fromanother person (donor) whose tissue is either the sameor very closely resembles the patient’s tissues. Thedonor may be a twin, a sibling, or a person who is notrelated at all. First, the patient’s bone marrow isdestroyed with very high doses of chemotherapy andradiation therapy. To replace the destroyed marrow,healthy marrow from the donor is given to the patientthrough a needle in the vein.\nIn the second type of bone marrow transplant, called\nan autologous bone marrow transplant, some of thepatient’s own marrow is taken out and treated with acombination of anticancer drugs to kill all the abnormal\ncells. This marrow is then frozen to save it. The marrowremaining in the patient’s body is then destroyed withhigh dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Follow-ing that, the patient’s own marrow that was frozen isthawed and given back to the patient through a needle inthe vein. This mode of bone marrow transplant is cur-rently being investigated in clinical trials.\nIn chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), chemother-\napy is generally the treatment of choice. Depending onthe stage of the disease, single or multiple drugs maybe given. Drugs commonly prescribed includesteroids, chlorambucil, fludarabine, and cladribine.Low dose radiation therapy may be given to the wholebody, or it may be used to alleviate the symptoms anddiscomfort due to an enlarged spleen and lymphnodes. The spleen may be removed in a procedurecalled a splenectomy .\nIn chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the treatment\nof choice is bone marrow transplantation. During theslow progress (chronic phase) of the disease, chemother-apy may be given to try to improve the cell counts. Radi-ation therapy, which involves the use of x rays or otherhigh-energy rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors,may be used in some cases to reduce the discomfort andpain due to an enlarged spleen. For chronic leukemias,the source of radiation is usually outside the body (exter-nal radiation therapy). If the leukemic cells have spreadto the brain, radiation therapy can be directed at thebrain. As the disease progresses, the spleen may beremoved in an attempt to try to control the pain and toimprove the blood counts.\nIn the acute phase of CML, aggressive chemothera-\npy is given. Combination chemotherapy, in which multi-ple drugs are used, is more efficient than using a singledrug for the treatment. The drugs may either be adminis-tered intravenously through a vein in the arm or bymouth in the form of pills. If the cancer cells have invad-ed the central nervous system (CNS), chemotherapeuticdrugs may be put into the fluid that surrounds the brainthrough a needle in the brain or back. This is known asintrathecal chemotherapy.\nBiological therapy or immunotherapy is a mode of\ntreatment in which the body’s own immune system isharnessed to fight the cancer. Substances that are rou-tinely made by the immune system (such as growthfactors, hormones, and disease-fighting proteins) areeither synthetically made in a laboratory, or their effec-tiveness is boosted and they are then put back into thepatient’s body. This treatment mode is also beinginvestigated in clinical trials all over the country atmajor cancer centers.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1992Leukemias, chronicPrognosis\nThe prognosis for leukemia depends on the patient’s\nage and general health. According to statistics, in chroniclymphoid leukemia, the overall survival for all stages ofthe disease is nine years. Most of the deaths in peoplewith CLL are due to infections or other illnesses thatoccur as a result of the leukemia.\nIn CML, if bone marrow transplantation is per-\nformed within one to three years of diagnosis, 50-60% ofthe patients survive three years or more. If the diseaseprogresses to the acute phase, the prognosis is poor. Lessthan 20% of these patients go into remission.\nPrevention\nMost cancers can be prevented by changes in\nlifestyle or diet, which will reduce the risk factors. How-ever, in leukemias, there are no known risk factors.Therefore, at the present time, there is no way known toprevent the leukemias from developing. People who areat an increased risk for developing leukemia because ofproven exposure to ionizing radiation, the organic liquidbenzene, or people who have a history of other cancers ofthe lymphoid system (Hodgkin’s lymphoma) shouldundergo periodic medical checkups.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, ed., et al.

    "content": "Lata Cherath, PhDLeukocytosis\nDefinition\nLeukocytosis is a condition characterized by an ele-\nvated number of white cells in the blood.\nDescription\nLeukocytosis is a condition that affects all types of\nwhite blood cells. Other illnesses, such as neutrophilia,lymphocytosis, and granulocytosis, target specific typesof white blood cells. Normal white blood cell counts are4,300-10,800 white blood cells per microliter. Leukocyteor white blood cell levels are considered elevated whenthey are between 15,000-20,000 per microliter. Theincreased number of leukocytes can occur abnormally asa result of an infection, cancer , or drug intake; however,\nleukocytosis can occur normally after eating a large mealor experiencing stress .\nCauses and symptoms\nLeukemias can cause white blood cell counts to\nincrease to as much as 100,000. Each kind of white cellcan produce a leukemia. Apart from leukemias, nearly allleukocytosis is due to one type of white blood cell, thepolymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN). These conditionsare more accurately referred to as neutrophilia.\nThe most common and important cause of neu-\ntrophilia is infection, and most infections cause neu-trophilia. The degree of elevation often indicates theseverity of the infection. Tissue damage from other caus-es raises the white count for similar reasons. Burns ,\ninfarction (cutting off the blood supply to a region of thebody so that it dies), crush injuries, inflammatory dis-eases, poisonings, and severe diseases, like kidney failureand diabetic ketoacidosis , all cause neutrophilia.\nCounts almost as high occur in leukemoid (leukemia-\nlike) reactions caused by infection and non-infectiousinflammation.\nDrugs can also cause leukocytosis. Cortisone-like\ndrugs (prednisone), lithium, and NSAIDs are the mostcommon offenders.\nNon-specific stresses also cause white blood cells to\nincrease in the blood. Extensive testing of medical stu-dents reveals that neutrophilia accompanies every exami-nation.

    "title": "Lice infestation",
    "content": "Lice infestation\nDefinition\nLice infestations (pediculosis) are infections of the\nskin, hair, or genital region caused by lice living directlyon the body or in hats or other garments. Lice are smallwingless insect-like parasites with sucking mouthpartsthat feed on human blood and lay their eggs on bodyhairs or in clothing. The name pediculosis comes fromthe Latin word for louse (singular) or lice (plural).\nDescription\nLice infestations are not dangerous infections by\nthemselves. It is, however a serious public health prob-lem because some lice can carry organisms that causeother diseases, including relapsing fever ,trench fever ,\nand epidemic typhus . Although trench fever is self-lim-\niting, the other two diseases have mortality rates of 5%-10%. Pubic lice are often associated with other sexually\ntransmitted diseases (STDs) but do not spread them.\nLice infestations are frequent occurrences in areas of\novercrowding or inadequate facilities for bathing and laun-dry. They are often associated with homelessness in thegeneral population or with military, refugee, or prisonercamps in war-torn areas. All humans are equally suscepti-ble to louse infestation; the elderly, however, are more vul-nerable to typhus and other diseases carried by lice.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe symptoms of lice infestations vary somewhat\naccording to body location, although all are characterizedby intense itching , usually with injury to the skin caused\nby scratching or scraping. The itching is an allergic reac-tion to a toxin in the saliva of the lice. Repeated bites canlead to a generalized skin eruption or inflammation.\nHead lice\nThis type of infestation is caused by Pediculosis\nhumanus capitis , the head louse. Head lice can be trans-\nmitted from one person to another by the sharing of hats,combs, or hair brushes. Epidemics of head lice are com-mon among school-age children from all class back-grounds in all parts of the United States. The head louseis about 1/16 of an inch in length. The adult form may bevisible on the patient’s scalp, especially around the ears;or its grayish-white nits (eggs) may be visible at the baseof the hairs close to the scalp. It takes between three and14 days for the nits to hatch. After the nits hatch, thelouse must feed on blood within a day or die.\nHead lice can spread from the scalp to the eyebrows,\neyelashes, and beard in adults, although they are moreoften limited to the scalp in children. The itching may beintense, and may be followed by bacterial infection ofskin that has been scratched open. Another common com-plication is swelling or inflammation of the neck glands.Head lice do not spread typhus or other systemic diseases.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1994Lice infestationKEY TERMS\nBiopsy —Surgical removal of tissue for examination.\nInflammation —Heat, swelling, redness, and pain\ncaused by tissue injury.\nKetoacidosis —A severe stage of diabetes where\nacids and ketones accumulate in the body.\nNSAID —Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\nsuch as ibuprofen.Body lice\nInfestations of body lice are caused by Pediculosis\nhumanus corporis , an organism that is similar in size to\nhead lice. Body lice, however, are rarely seen on the skinitself because they come to the skin only to feed. Theyshould be looked for in the seams of the patient’s cloth-ing. This type of infestation is associated by wearing thesame clothing for long periods of time without launder-ing, as may happen in wartime or in cold climates; orwith poor personal hygiene. It can be spread by closepersonal contact or shared bedding.\nPatients with body lice often have intense itching with\ndeep scratches around the upper shoulders, flanks, or neck.The bites first appear as small red pimples but may cause ageneralized skin rash. If the infestation is not treated, thepatient may develop complications that include headache ,\nfever, and bacterial infection with scarring. Body lice canspread systemic typhus or other infections.\nPubic lice\nPubic lice are sometimes called “crabs.” This type of\ninfestation is caused by Phthirus pubis and is commonly\nspread by intimate contact. People can also get publiclice from using the bedding, towels, or clothes of aninfected person.\nPubic lice usually appear first on pubic hair, but may\nspread to other parts of the body, particularly if thepatient is very hairy. Pubic lice are also sometimes seenon the eyelashes of children born to infected mothers. Itis usually easier for the doctor to see marks from thepatient’s scratching than the bites from the lice, but pubiclice sometimes produce small bluish spots called macu-lae ceruleae on the patient’s trunk or thighs. Pubic licealso sometimes leave small dark brown specks from theirown excreted matter on the parts of the patient’s under-wear that cover the anal or genital areas.\nDiagnosis\nDoctors can diagnose lice infestations from looking\nclosely at the parts of the body where the patient hasbeen scratching. Lice are large enough to be easily seenwith the naked eye or a magnifying glass. The eggs ofpubic lice as well as head lice can often be found bylooking at the base of the patient’s hairs. Pediatriciansare most likely to diagnose lice in school-age children.\nIt is important for doctors to rule out other diseases\nthat can cause scratching and skin inflammation becausethe medications used to kill lice are very strong and canhave bothersome side effects. The doctor will need to dis-tinguish between head lice and dandruff; between bodylice and scabies (a disease caused by skin mites); andbetween pubic lice and eczema. Blood tests or other labo-\nratory tests are not useful in diagnosing lice infestations.\nTreatment\nLice infestations are treated with externally applied\nmedications that either kill the lice or prevent them fromfeeding. Cases of head lice are usually treated withshampoos or rinses containing either lindane (Kwell) orpermethrin (Nix). Because lindane is absorbed throughthe skin, the person giving the application should wearrubber gloves and rinse the patient’s hair or body com-pletely after use. Following the treatment, nits should beremoved from the hair with a fine-toothed comb ortweezers. Lindane is also effective for treating infesta-tions of body or pubic lice, but it should not be used bypregnant women. In most cases one treatment is suffi-cient, but the medication can be reapplied a week later ifliving lice have reappeared.\nInfestations of body lice can also be treated by wash-\ning the patient’s clothes or bedding in boiling water, iron-ing seams with an iron on a high setting, or treating theclothes with 1% malathion powder or 10% DDT powder.\nIf the patient’s eyelashes have been infested, the only\nsafe treatments are either a thick coating of petroleum jelly(Vaseline) applied twice daily for eight days, or 1% yellowoxide of mercury applied four times a day for two weeks.Any remaining nits should be removed with tweezers.\nPatients with pubic lice should be examined and\ntested for other STDs.\nAlternative treatment\nFor pubic lice, some practitioners of holistic medi-\ncine recommend a mixture of 25% oil of pennyroyal\n(Mentha pulegium ), 25% garlic ( Allium sativum ) oil, and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1995Lice infestation\nThis woman’s eyelashes are infested with nits, or eggs, of a\nbody louse.

In general, patients are more at risk fromtyphus and other diseases spread by lice than from thelice themselves.\nPrevention\nThere are no vaccines or skin treatments that will\nprotect a person against lice prior to contact. In addition,lice infestation does not provide immunity against rein-fection; recurrences are in fact quite common. Preventiondepends on adequate personal hygiene at the individuallevel and the following public health measures:\n• teaching school-age children the basics of good person-\nal hygiene, including the importance of not lending orborrowing combs, brushes, or hats\n• notifying and treating an adult patient’s close personal\nand sexual contacts\n• examining homeless people, elderly patients incapable\nof self-care, and other high-risk individuals prior tohospital admission for signs of louse infestation.

(Custom Medical Stock\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)Description\nLichen planus affects between 1-2% of the popula-\ntion, most of whom are middle-aged women. The condi-tion is less common in the very young and the very old.The lesions are found on the skin, genitals, and in themouth. Most cases resolve spontaneously within twoyears. Lichen planus is found throughout the world andis equally distributed among races.\nCauses and symptoms\nNo one knows what causes lichen planus, although\nsome experts suspect that it is an abnormal immune reactionfollowing a viral infection, probably aggravated by stress .\nThe condition is similar to symptoms caused by exposure toarsenic, bismuth, gold, or developers used in color photog-raphy. Occasionally, lichen planus in the mouth appears tobe an allergic reaction to medications, filling material, den-tal hygiene products, chewing gum or candy.\nSymptoms can appear suddenly, or they may gradu-\nally develop, usually on the arms or legs. The lesions onthe skin may be preceded by a dryness and metallic tasteor burning in the mouth.\nOnce the lesions appear, they change over time into\nflat, glistening, purple lesions marked with white lines orspots. Mild to severe itching is common. White, lacy\nlesions are usually painless, but eroded lesions often burnand can be painful. As the lesions clear up, they usuallyleave a brown discoloration behind, especially in darkskinned people.\nLichen planus in the mouth occurs in six different\nforms with a variety of symptoms, appearing as lacy-white streaks, white plaques, or eroded ulcers. Often thegums are affected, so that the surface of the gum peelsoff, leaving the gums red and raw.Diagnosis\nA doctor can probably diagnose the condition sim-\nply from looking at the characteristic lesions, but a skin\nbiopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment is aimed at easing symptoms. Itching can\nbe treated with steroid creams and oral antihistamines .\nSevere lesions can be treated with corticosteroids by\nmouth, or combinations of photochemotherapy (PUV A)and griseofulvin.\nPatients with lesions in the mouth may find that regu-\nlar professional cleaning of the teeth and conscientiousdental care improve the condition. Using milder tooth-pastes instead of tartar control products also seems tolessen the number of ulcers and makes them less sensitive.\nPrognosis\nWhile lichen planus can be annoying, it is usually\nfairly benign and clears up on its own.

    "content": "Lichen simplex chronicus\nDefinition\nLichen simplex chronicus is a chronic inflammation\nof the skin ( dermatitis ) characterized by small, round\nitchy spots that thicken and become leathery as a resultof scratching.\nDescription\nAlso termed neurodermatis, lichen simplex chroni-\ncus is the result of chronic skin irritation. It occurs in 4-5out of every thousand people. Initial irritation causesitching , and in turn, itching causes scratching. Scratch-\ning leads to further irritation, which damages the skin.The possibility of infection is greatly increased when theouter layer of protective skin is broken. Skin usuallyrepairs itself quickly; however, in the case of lichen sim-plex chronicus, healing skin causes more itching andmore scratching causes a thickening of the skin (lichen).The small skin patches are usually 1–10 in (2.54–25.4cm) in diameter.\nCauses and symptoms\nLichen simplex chronicus is often caused by con-\nstant rubbing of the skin. The rubbing begins the chain ofevents that leads from itching to scratching and then tothe presence of leather-like skin patches.\nSymptoms are chronic itching which is often accom-\npanied by nervous tension. The appearance of scratchmarks and the leathery skin patches can be found any-where on the body. A prolonged lichen simplex chroni-cus can result in brown-colored pigmentation at the siteof irritation.\nDiagnosis\nA dermatologist, a physician specializing in the\nstudy and treatment of skin disorders, can make a diag-nosis after a visual exam.KEY TERMS\nAntihistamine —A chemical that interferes with\nthe action of histamine. Histamine is part of aninflammatory response and helps to cause itching.\nCallus —Thickened skin due to chronic rubbing or\nirritation.\nLesion —Abnormal change in tissue caused by\nlocalized disease.\nTreatment\nTreatment of the itching is necessary to stop the\nscratching and resulting skin damage. There are a num-ber of ways to stop itching. Perhaps the most important isto cut fingernails very short. Ice can substitute for therelief of scratching. Heat and fuzzy clothing worsen itch-ing; cold and smooth clothing pacify it. If the itching ispersistent, dressings may be applied to the affected areas.\nAmong the topical medications that relieve itching are\na number of commercial preparations containing menthol,camphor, eucalyptus oil, and aloe. Topical cortisone is alsoavailable without a prescription. Some preparations alsocontain antihistamines , which penetrate intact skin poor-\nly. All these medicines work better under occlusion, whichmeans putting a waterproof barrier like a rubber glove orplastic wrap over them. For broken skin, topical antibi-\notics like bacitracin help prevent infection. These should\nbe used early to forestall further damage to the skin.\nReducing the buildup of thick skin may require med-\nicines that dissolve or melt keratin, the major chemical inskin’s outer layer. These keratolytics include urea, lacticacid, and salicylic acid.\nResistant cases of lichen simplex chronicus will\noften respond to cortisone-like drugs injected directlyinto the lesions.\nSedatives or tranquilizers may be prescribed to com-\nbat the nervous tension and anxiety that often accompa-\nnies the condition.\nPrognosis\nDiligent adherence to treatment is usually rewarded\nwith a resolution of the condition. The original cause ofitching may be gone, or it may reappear. Preventive treat-ment in its early stages will arrest the process.\nPrevention\nEarly, gentler substitutes for scratching can entirely\nprevent lichen simplex chronicus.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1998Lichen simplex chronicusResources\nBOOKS\nHabif, Thomas P. “Lichen Simplex Chronicus.” In Clinical\nDermatology: A Color Guide to Diagnosis and Therapy.St. Louis: Mosby, 1995.\nParker, Frank. “Skin Diseases of General Importance.” Cecil\nTextbook of Medicine , ed.

    "title": "Life support",
    "content": "Life support\nDefinition\nLife support refers to a spectrum of techniques used to\nmaintain life after the failure of one or more vital organs.\nPurpose\nA patient requires life support when one or more\nvital organs fail, due to causes such as trauma, infection,cancer ,heart attack , or chronic disease. Among the\npurposes of life support are to:\n• establish and maintain the ABC’s of resuscitation—air-\nway, breathing, and circulation\n• restore the patient’s homeostasis—the internal chemi-\ncal and physical balance of the body\n• protect the patient from complications of the underly-\ning disease and its treatment\nPrecautions\nPatients and families need to recognize that life sup-\nport is an extremely painful, expensive, and emotionallywrenching experience. Life support exposes a patient tovast risks of further medical complications, and offers noguarantee of a positive outcome. Even in successfulcases, recovery may be slow and frustrating.\nDescription\nSuccessful life support begins with establishing the\nABC’s of resuscitation—airway, breathing, and circulation.\nThe airway refers to a clear passageway for air to\nenter the lungs from outside the body. The patient’s air-way may become blocked by:• foreign body obstruction, as by food or dentures\n• injury-related damage and swelling, as from a wound or\nsurgery\n• loss of protective reflexes due to coma of any origin\nLife support may begin with basic cardiopul-\nmonary resuscitation (CPR ), as in cases of cardiac\narrest. Thereafter, the most common technique used tocreate a secure airway is insertion of an endotracheal(ET) tube through the mouth or nose into the windpipe(trachea). An alternative method of securing an airway isby tracheotomy , a surgical procedure in which a tube is\ninserted into the trachea through an incision made in thebase of the throat. Of the two options, placement of anET tube is usually quicker and more convenient, and thusoccurs much more commonly. Doctors perform a tra-cheotomy when they cannot establish an ET airway, orwhen the patient will require an artificial airway for morethan a week or two.\nBreathing refers to the movement of air in and out of\nthe lungs. Inadequate breathing may result from:\n• heart disease, as in congestive heart failure• primary disease of the lungs, such as pneumonia ,asth-\nma, or emphysema\n• coma of any cause, such as narcotic overdose or stroke\n• muscle fatigue or neuromuscular disease ( spinal cord\ninjury or polio)\n• pain, from rib fractures or surgery on the chest\nWhen the patient cannot breathe sufficiently, the\nphysician will use a ventilator, a machine that pumps airin and out of the patient’s lungs. For many doctors andmembers of the public, the term “life support” calls upthe image of an ET tube and ventilator.\nCirculation refers to the flow of blood around the\nbody from the heart to vital organs. Circulation can faildue to:\n• primary disease of the heart (heart attack)• blood loss (trauma or internal bleeding of any cause)• severe infection (sepsis)\n• drug reactions or overdoses\n• extreme allergic reaction• severe dehydration (gastroenteritis or heat-related ill-\nness)\nIn order to ensure adequate circulation, the patient\nwill require one or more intravenous (IV) tubes(catheters). The IVs may include both the short needleand tube commonly used in the hand or forearm, andlonger catheters inserted into the larger and more centralveins of the body. Catheters inserted into these larger\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1999Life supportveins are known as central lines. Through the IVs the\npatient receives fluids, drugs, and blood transfusions asneeded to support the circulation.\nOnce the ABC’s are secure, life support is directed at\nmaintaining homeostasis, the body’s delicate chemicaland physical balance. In a healthy person, the body keepsprecise control over many components of its makeup,such as its fluids, nutrients, and pressures. When vitalorgans fail, the body can no longer regulate these compo-nents, and the doctor must take steps to restore the nor-mal state.\nPreserving the body’s internal equilibrium requires\ncareful monitoring of innumerable indicators of thepatient’s well-being. These indicators include:\n• vital signs (heartbeats per minute, breaths per minute,\nblood pressure, body temperature, and weight)\n• fluids (input and output of the body)• blood cell counts• chemical substances of the body (sodium, potassium,\nsugar, and many others)\n• pressures in the circulation, lungs, and perhaps even the\nbrain\n• presence of germs (bacteria, fungi) causing infection in\nbody systems (lungs, blood, urine)\nThis intensive monitoring usually takes place in an\nintensive care unit (ICU) or critical care unit (CCU) andrequires:\n• specialized physicians, such as cardiologists, inten-\nsivists, and surgeons\n• highly-skilled nursing care, often one nurse per patient\naround-the-clock\n• extensive support staff, such as respiratory therapists,\nlaboratory technicians, radiology technicians, dieti-cians, and pharmacists\n• constant measurement of basics such as pulse, heart\nrhythm, and oxygen level in the blood\n• frequent inspection of the patient’s alertness, color, and\nlevel of pain\n• use of catheters in the veins and arteries to withdraw\nblood samples and measure pressures in the circulation\n• use of tubes in the bladder (Foley catheter), stomach\n(nasogastric tube), and other body cavities\n• frequent laboratory tests on blood, urine, drainage from\nwounds , and other body specimens\n• x-ray, ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), and\nother imaging procedures\n• electrocardiogramsThe treatments of life support include:\n• oxygen\n• intravenous fluids with sugar and basic salts\n• drugs to improve circulation and other body functions• antibiotics• transfusions\n• surgery\n• nutritional supplements by vein or stomach tube• tubes in body cavities (chest or abdomen) to relieve\nfluid buildup\n• dialysis\n• pacemaker\n• electrical defibrillation• various machines to assist heart or lung function• transplantation of organs or mechanical substitutes\n(artificial heart)\n• sedation or even temporary paralysis to enable the\npatient to tolerate these procedures\nPreparation\nThe need for life support may arise suddenly and\nwith little warning. All people should discuss in advancewith family and doctor their wishes for the use of lifesupport should a medical crisis develop. The doctor willnote the preferences in the patient’s record. Patientsshould sign documents such as an Advance Directive andDurable Power of Attorney for Health Care to expresstheir wishes and designate a surrogate decision-maker incase of incapacitation.\nPhysicians and medical care providers must antici-\npate the possibility that a patient will require life support,perhaps suddenly. In preparation, doctors and medicalstaff must:\n• receive training in resuscitation skills\n• monitor patients carefully• maintain proper supplies and equipment• discuss in advance with patients and patients’ families\nwhether or not to begin life support\nAftercare\nIf a patient survives life support treatments, doctors\nwill cautiously try to wean the patient from the supportsystems. Being able to breathe adequately without the ven-tilator is one major hurdle. Patients commonly fail in theirfirst attempts to breathe on their own, often tiring out after\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2000Life supporta few hours. Thus, the doctor will reconnect the ventilator,\ngive the patient a rest, and try again in a day or two.\nAs the patient regains organ function, there is less\nneed for monitors, tests, and treatments that require anintensive care setting. The doctor may transfer the patientto a lower level of hospital care, a skilled nursing facility(SNF), or perhaps directly to home. Physical and occupa-tional therapists may help the patient improve strengthand endurance. The patient will receive continuing carefrom the primary doctor and specialists as needed. Thepatient may require prescription drugs, assist devices,and psychological therapists.\nRisks\nThe risks and consequences of life support are enor-\nmous. These risks include:\n• physical dangers\n• emotional suffering• financial costs• societal discord\nThe physical dangers of life support encompass all\nthe hazards of the patient’s underlying disease and treat-ments. Among these risks are:\n• permanent damage to the brain, kidneys, and other vital\norgans caused by poor circulation or low oxygen con-tent of the blood\n• direct damage to organs from use of medical instru-\nments and proceduresKEY TERMS\nCardiopulmonary —Relating to the heart and lungs.\nCentral line —A tube placed by needle into a large,\ncentral vein of the body.\nComa —Unconsciousness.\nDefibrillation —Use of an electric shock to restore a\nnormal heartbeat.\nEndotracheal tube —A tube placed into the wind-\npipe through the nose or mouth.\nFoley catheter —A tube that drains urine from the\nbladder.\nHomeostasis —The internal chemical and physical\nbalance of the body.\nNasogastric tube —A tube placed through the nose\ninto the stomach.Neuromuscular —Relating to nerves and muscles.\nResuscitation —Treatments to restore an adequate\nairway, breathing, and circulation.\nSepsis —An overwhelming infection with effects\nthroughout the body.\nTracheotomy —A surgical procedure in which a\ntube is inserted into the trachea through an incisionmade in the base of the throat.\nTrauma —Serious physical injury.\nVentilator —A machine that pumps air in and out of\nthe lungs.\nVital signs —Basic indicators of body function, usually\nmeaning heartbeats per minute, breaths per minute,blood pressure, body temperature, and weight.\n• infections, often with organisms that are highly resis-\ntant to antibiotics\n• abnormal blood clots\n• skin ulcers from lying immobilized for long periods• extreme pain\n• exposure of medical personnel to communicable dis-\neases\nThe emotional consequences of life support touch\npatients, families, and medical caregivers. These reper-cussions arise from:\n• the frightening environment of an ICU\n• the need to make life-and-death decisions\n• the anger, guilt, and grief that relate to life-threatening\nillness\n• the fact that many lengthy and difficult treatments will\nend in failure\nThe financial costs of life support are huge. A single\nday of life support costs many thousands of dollars. Theseexpenses fall on individual payers, insurance companies,health plans, and governments. All such payers face diffi-cult decisions regarding the allotment of money for suchtreatment, especially in cases that are likely to be futile.\nSociety as a whole faces difficult decisions surround-\ning life support. Some governments have enacted regula-tions that establish priorities for the spending of healthcare resources. Patients who do not receive treatmentunder such rules may feel victimized by society’s choices.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2001Life supportResources\nBOOKS\nIrwin, Richard S., Frank B.

    "title": "Lipase test",
    "content": "Lipase test\nDefinition\nThe lipase test is a blood test performed to deter-\nmine the serum level of a specific protein (enzyme)involved in digestion. Lipase is an enzyme produced bythe pancreas, which is a large gland situated near thestomach. Lipase works to break down a certain type ofblood lipid (triglycerides) into fatty acids.\nLipase appears in the blood together with another\nenzyme called amylase following damage to or diseasesaffecting the pancreas. It was once thought that abnor-mally high lipase levels were associated only with dis-eases of the pancreas. Other conditions are now known tobe associated with high lipase levels, especially kidneyfailure and intestinal obstruction. Diseases involving thepancreas, however, produce much higher lipase levelsthan diseases of other organs. Lipase levels in pancreaticdisorders are often five to 10 times higher than normal.\nPurpose\nThe lipase test is most often used in evaluating\ninflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ), but it is also\nuseful in diagnosing kidney failure, intestinal obstruction,mumps , and peptic ulcers. Doctors often order amylase\nand lipase tests at the same time to help distinguish pan-creatitis from ulcers and other disorders in the abdomen.If the patient has acute (sudden onset) pancreatitis, thelipase level usually rises somewhat later than the amylaselevel—about 24-48 hours after onset of symptoms—andremains abnormally high for five to seven days. Becausethe lipase level peaks later and remains elevated longer,its determination is more useful in late diagnosis of acutepancreatitis. Conversely, however, lipase levels are not asuseful in diagnosing chronic pancreatic disease.\nPrecautions\nPatients should be asked whether they are taking cer-\ntain prescription drugs that can affect the accuracy of thelipase test. Drugs that can cause elevated lipase levelsinclude bethanechol, cholinergics, codeine, indomethacin,meperidine, methacholine, and morphine. Drugs that maydecrease levels include calcium ions.\nDescription\nA lipase test is performed on a sample of the patient’s\nblood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuum tube. Theprocedure, which is called a venipuncture, takes aboutfive minutes.\nPreparation\nThe patient should have nothing to eat or drink for\n12 hours before the lipase test.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the puncture site, a small bruise orswelling in the area, fainting , or feeling lightheaded.\nNormal results\nReference values for lipase determination are labo-\nratory- and method-specific. In general, normal resultsare usually less than 200 units/L (triolein methods bytitration or turbidimetry).\nAbnormal results\nIncreased lipase levels are found in acute pancreati-\ntis, chronic relapsing pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer .\nHigh lipase levels also occur in certain liver diseases,kidney failure, bowel obstruction, peptic ulcer disease,and tumors or inflammation of the salivary glands.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

    "title": "Lipidoses",
    "content": "Lipidoses\nDefinition\nLipidoses are heredity disorders, passed from parents\nto their children, characterized by defects of the digestivesystem that impair the way the body uses fat from thediet. When the body is unable to properly digest fats,lipids accumulate in body tissues in abnormal amounts.\nDescription\nThe digestion, storage, and use of fats from foods is\na complex process that involves hundreds of chemicalreactions in the body. In most people, the body is alreadyprogrammed by its genetic code to produce all of theenzymes and chemicals necessary to carry out thesefunctions. These genetic instructions are passed fromparents to their offspring during reproduction.\nPeople with lipidoses are born without the genetic\ncodes needed to tell their bodies how to complete a par-ticular part of the fat digestion process. In most of thesedisorders, the body does not produce a certain enzyme orchemical. Over 30 different disorders of fat metabolismKEY TERMS\nAmylase —A digestive enzyme that breaks down\nstarch.\nLipid —A greasy organic compound that cannot be\ndissolved in water. Triglycerides, which are brokendown by lipase, are one type of blood lipid.\nPancreas —An elongated gland situated across the\nback of the abdomen behind the stomach. Itsecretes both digestive enzymes and hormones.Pancreatic hormones regulate the level of sugar inthe blood.\nPancreatitis —Inflammation of the pancreas, fre-\nquently caused by gallstones, alcohol abuse, viralinfection, or injury.\nTurbidimetry —A technique of measurement that\nanalyzes the amount of sediment in a liquid.are related to genetic defects. Although the defects are\npassed from parents to children, the parents often do nothave the disorders themselves.\nThe symptoms, available treatments, and long-term\nconsequences of these conditions vary greatly. Some ofthe conditions become apparent shortly after the infant isborn; in others, symptoms may not develop until adult-hood. For most of the lipidoses, diagnosis is suspectedbased on the symptoms and family history. Blood tests,urine tests, and tissue tests can be used to confirm thediagnosis. Genetic testing can be used, in some cases, to\nidentify the defective gene. Some of these disorders canbe controlled with changes in the diet, medications, orenzyme supplements. For many, no treatment is avail-able. Some may cause death in childhood or contribute\nto a shortened life expectancy. Some of the most com-mon or most serious lipidoses are discussed below.\nCauses and symptoms\nFabry’s disease\nApproximately one in every 40,000 males is born with\nFabry’s disease. This condition has an X-linked, recessivepattern of inheritance, meaning that the defective gene iscarried on the X chromosome. A female who carries adefective recessive gene on one of her two X chromosomeshas a 50% chance of passing the defective gene to her sonswho will develop the disorder associated with the defectivegene (a male receives one X chromosome from his motherand one Y chromosome from his father). She also has a50% chance of passing the defective recessive gene to herdaughters who will be carries of the disorder (like theirmother). Some female carries of Fabry’s disease show mildsigns of the disorder, especially cloudiness of the cornea.\nThe gene that is defective in Fabry’s disease causes a\ndeficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Withoutthis enzyme, fatty compounds starts to line the blood ves-sels. The collection of fatty deposits eventually affectsblood vessels in the skin, heart, kidneys, and nervoussystem. The first symptoms in childhood are pain and\ndiscomfort in the hands and feet brought on by exercise ,\nfever ,stress , or changes in the weather. A raised rash of\ndark red-purple spots is common, especially on skinbetween the waistline and the knees. Other symptomsinclude a decreased ability to sweat and changes in thecornea or outer layer of the eye. Although the diseasebegins in childhood, it progresses very slowly. Kidneyand heart problems develop in adulthood.\nGaucher disease\nGaucher (pronounced go-shay) disease is the most\ncommon of the lipid storage disorders. It is found in pop-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2003Lipidosesulations all over the world (20,00 to 40,000 people have a\ntype of the disease), and it occurs with equal frequencyin males and females. Gaucher disease has a recessive\npattern of inheritance, meaning that a person must inherita copy of the defective gene from both parents in order tohave the disease. The genetic defect causes a deficiencyof the enzyme glucocerebrosidase that is responsible forbreaking down a certain type of fat and releasing it fromfat cells. These fat cells begin to crowd out healthy cellsin the liver, spleen, bones, and nervous system. Symp-toms of Gaucher disease can start in infancy, childhood,or adulthood.\nThree types of Gaucher disease have been identified,\nbut there are many variations in how symptoms develop.Type 1 is the most common and affects both children andadults. It occurs much more often in people of EasternEuropean and Russian Jewish (Ashkenazi) ancestry,affecting one out of every 450 live births. The first signsof the disease include an enlarged liver and spleen, caus-ing the abdomen to swell. Children with this conditionmay be shorter than normal. Other symptoms includetiredness, pain, bone deterioration, broken bones, ane-mia, and increased bruising. Type 2 Gaucher disease ismore serious, beginning within the first few months afterbirth. Symptoms, which are similar to those in Type 1,progress rapidly, but also include nervous system dam-age. Symptoms of Type 3 Gaucher disease begin duringearly childhood with symptoms like Type 1. Unlike Type2, the progress of the disease is slower, although it alsoincludes nervous system damage.\nKrabbe’s disease\nKrabbe’s disease is caused by a deficiency of the\nenzyme galactoside beta-galactosidase. It has a recessivepattern of inheritance and is believed to occur in 1 of40,000 births in the United States. This condition, whichis also called globoid cell leukodystrophy or Krabbeleukodystrophy, is characterized by acute nervous systemdegeneration. It develops in early infancy with initialsymptoms of irritability, vomiting and episodes of partialunconsciousness. Symptoms progress rapidly to seizures,difficulty swallowing, blindness, deafness, mental retar-\ndation , and paralysis .\nNiemann-pick disease\nAt least five different forms of Niemann-Pick dis-\nease (NPD) have been identified. The different typesseem to be related to the activity level of the enzymesphingomyelinase. In patients with Types A and B NPD,there is a build up of sphingomyelin in cells of the brain,liver, spleen, kidney and lung. Type A is the most com-mon form of NPD and the most serious, with death usu-ally occurring by the age of 18 months. Symptoms devel-\nop within the first few months of life and include poorappetite, failure to grow, enlarged liver and spleen, andthe appearance of cherry red spots in the retina of theeye. Type B develops in infancy or childhood with symp-toms of mild liver or spleen enlargement and lung prob-lems. Some adults with this form (Type E) may alsoshow a loss of muscle coordination. Types C or D NPDare related to cholesterol transfer out of cells. Childrenwith Types C or D grow normally in early childhood, buteventually develop difficulty in walking and loss of mus-cle coordination. Ultimately, the nervous systembecomes severely damaged and these patients die. TypeC occurs in any population, while Type D has been iden-tified only in patients from Nova Scotia, Canada.\nRefsum’s disease\nRefsum’s disease has a recessive pattern of inheri-\ntance and affects populations from Northern Europe, par-ticularly Scandinavians most frequently. It is due to adeficiency of phytanic acid hydroxylase, an enzyme thatbreaks down a fatty acid called phytanic acid. This con-dition affects the nervous system, eyes, bones, and skin.Symptoms, which usually appear by age 20, includevision problems [retinitis pigmentosa and rhythmic eyemovements (nystagmus)], loss of muscle coordination,loss of sense of smell ( anosmia ), pain, numbness, and\nelevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid.\nTay-sachs disease\nTay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a fatal condition caused\nby a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A (Hex-A).The defective gene that causes this disorder is found inroughly 1 in 250 people in the general population. Howev-er, certain populations have significantly higher rates ofTSD. French-Canadians living near the St. LawrenceRiver and in the Cajun regions of Louisiana are at higherrisk of having a child with TSD. The highest risk seems tobe in people of Eastern European and Russian Jewish(Ashkenazi) descent. Tay-Sachs disease has a recessivepattern of inheritance, and approximately 1 in every 27people of Jewish ancestry in the United States carries theTSD gene. Symptoms develop in infancy and are due tothe accumulation of a fatty acid compound in the nervoussystem. Early symptoms include loss of vision and physi-cal coordination, seizures, and mental retardation. Eventu-ally, the child develops problems with breathing and swal-lowing. Blindness, paralysis, and death follow.\nWolman’s disease\nWolman’s disease is caused by a genetic defect (with\na recessive pattern of inheritance) that results in deficien-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2004Lipidoses(Cerezyme). Other treatments address specific symptoms\nsuch as anemia, broken bones, or pain.\nKrabbe’s disease\nNo treatment is available.\nNiemann-pick disease\nTreatment consists of supportive care to deal with\nsymptoms and the development of complications. Bone\nmarrow transplantation is being investigated as a pos-\nsible treatment. Low-cholesterol diets may be helpful for\npatients with Types C and D.\nRefsum’s disease\nA diet free of phytanic acid (found in dairy products,\ntuna, cod, haddock, lamb, stewed beef, white bread,white rice, boiled potatoes, and egg yolk) can reducesome of the symptoms. Plasmapheresis , a process\nwhere whole blood is removed from the body, processedthrough a filtering system, and then return to the body,may be used to filter phytanic acid from the blood.\nTay-Sachs disease\nThere is no treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Parents\nwho are identified as carriers may want to seek genetic\ncounseling . If a fetus is identified as having TSD, par-\nents may consider termination of the pregnancy .\nWolman’s disease\nNo treatment is currently available.\nPrognosis\nFabry’s diseaseAlthough patients with Fabry’s disease usually sur-\nvive to adulthood, they are at increased risk for stroke ,\nheart attacks, and kidney damage.\nGaucher disease\nThe pain and deformities associated with symptoms\ncan make coping with this illness very challenging forindividuals and families. With treatment and control ofsymptoms, people with Type 1 Gaucher disease may leadfairly long and normal lives. Most infants with Type 2 diebefore the age of 2. Children with Type 3 Gaucher dis-ease may survive to adolescence and early adulthood.\nKrabbe’s disease\nChildren born with Krabbe’s disease die in infancy.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2005Lipidosescy of an enzyme that breaks down cholesterol. This caus-\nes large amounts of fat to accumulate in body tissues.Symptoms begin in the first few weeks of life andinclude an enlarged liver and spleen, adrenal calcification(hardening of adrenal tissue due to deposits of calciumsalts), and fatty stools.\nDiagnosis\nFabry’s disease\nThe diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood test to\nmeasure for alpha-galactosidase A. Women who are car-ries of the defective gene can also be identified by ablood test.\nGaucher disease\nGaucher disease may be suspected based on symp-\ntoms and is confirmed with a blood test for levels of theenzyme. Samples of tissue from an affected area mayalso be used to confirm a diagnosis of the disease.\nNiemann-Pick disease\nDiagnosis is confirmed by analyzing a sample of tis-\nsue. Prenatal diagnosis of Types A and B of NPD can bedone with amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling\nTay-Sachs disease\nCarriers of the Tay-Sachs related gene can be identi-\nfied with a blood test. Amniocentesis or chorionic villisampling can be used to determine if the fetus has Tay-Sachs disease.\nTreatment\nFabry’s disease\nTreatment focuses on prevention of symptoms and\nlong-term complications. Daily doses of diphenylhydan-toin (Dilantin) or carbamazapine (Tegretol) can preventor reduce the severity of pain in the hands and feet asso-ciated with the condition. A low sodium, low protein dietmay be beneficial to those patients who have some kid-ney complications. If kidney problems progress, kidney\ndialysis or kidney transplantation may be required.\nEnzyme replacement therapy is currently being explored.\nGaucher disease\nThe symptoms of Gaucher disease can be stopped\nand even reversed by treatment with injections ofenzyme replacements. Two enzyme drugs currentlyavailable are alglucerase (Ceredase) and imigluceraseNiemann-Pick disease\nPatients with Type A NPD usually die within the first\nyear and a half of life. Type B patients generally live toadulthood but suffer from significant liver and lung prob-lems. With Types C and D NPD, there is significant ner-vous system damage leading to severe muscle spasms,seizures, and eventually, to coma and death. Some\npatients with Types C and D die in childhood, while lessseverely affected patients may survive to adulthood.\nTay-Sachs disease\nChildren born with Tay-Sachs disease become\nincreasingly debilitated; most die by about age four.\nWolman’s disease\nDeath generally occurs before six months of age.\nPrevention\nCouples who have family histories of genetic defects\ncan undergo genetic testing and counseling to see if theyare at risk for having a child with one of the lipidoses dis-orders. During pregnancy, cell samples can be collectedfrom the fetus using amniocentesis or chorionic villiKEY TERMS\nAmniocentesis —A procedure where a needle is\ninserted through the abdomen into the uterus of apregnant woman to remove a small amount of thefluid that surrounds the developing fetus. This testcan be preformed at about week 16 of the preg-nancy. Cells from the fetus can be tested for genet-ic defects.\nChorionic villi sampling —A procedure to remove\na small tissue sample of the placenta, the sac thatsurrounds the developing fetus. This test can beperformed as early as week 10 of the pregnancy.The tissue can be tested for genetic defects.\nLipids —Organic compounds not soluble in water,\nbut soluble in fat solvents such as alcohol. Lipidsare stored in the body as energy reserves and arealso important components of cell membranes.\nRecessive —Refers to an inherited characteristic or\ntrait that is expressed only when two copies of thegene responsible for it are present.\nX-linked —Refers to a gene carried on the X chro-\nmosome, one of the two sex chromosomes.sampling.

    "title": "Lipoproteins test",
    "content": "Lipoproteins test\nDefinition\nLipoproteins are the “packages” in which choles-\nterol and triglycerides travel throughout the body. Mea-suring the amount of cholesterol carried by each type oflipoprotein helps determine a person’s risk for cardiovas-cular disease (disease that affects the heart and bloodvessels, also called CVD).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2006Lipoproteins testPurpose\nCholesterol and triglycerides are fat-like substances\ncalled lipids. Cholesterol is used to build cell membranesand hormones. The body makes cholesterol and gets it fromfood. Triglycerides provide a major source of energy to thebody tissues. Both cholesterol and triglycerides are vital tobody function, but an excess of either one, especially cho-lesterol, puts a person at risk of cardiovascular disease.\nBecause cholesterol and triglycerides can’t dissolve\nin watery liquid, they must be transported by somethingthat can dissolve in blood serum. Lipoproteins containcholesterol and triglycerides at the core and an outerlayer of protein, called apolipoprotein.\nThere are four major classes of lipoproteins: chy-\nlomicrons, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins(HDL). There are also less commonly measured classessuch as lipoprotein(a) and subtypes of the main classes.Each lipoprotein has characteristics that make the choles-terol it carries a greater or lesser risk. Measuring eachtype of lipoprotein helps determine a person’s risk for car-diovascular disease more accurately than cholesterol mea-surement alone. When a person is discovered to be at risk,treatment by diet or medication can be started and his orher response to treatment monitored by repeated testing.\nDescription\nChylomicrons\nChylomicrons are made in the intestines from the\ntriglycerides in food. They contain very little cholesterol.Chylomicrons circulate in the blood, getting smaller asthey deposit the triglycerides in fatty tissue. Twelvehours after a meal, they are gone from circulation. Serumcollected from a person directly after eating will form acreamy layer on the top if left undisturbed and refrigerat-ed overnight. This creamy layer is the chylomicrons.\nV ery low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)\nVLDL are formed in the liver by the combination of\ncholesterol, triglycerides formed from circulating fattyacids, and apolipoprotein. This lipoprotein particle issmaller than a chylomicron, and contains less triglyceridebut more cholesterol (10-15% of a person’s total choles-terol). As the VLDL circulates in the blood, triglyceridesare deposited and the particle gets smaller, eventuallybecoming a low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Serum from aperson with a large amount of VLDL will be cloudy.\nLow-density lipoproteins (LDL)\nLDL, often called “bad” cholesterol, is formed pri-\nmarily by the breakdown of VLDL. LDL contains littletriglycerides and a large amount of cholesterol (60-70%\nof a person’s total cholesterol). Although the particles aremuch smaller than chylomicrons and VLDL, LDL parti-cles can vary in size and chemical structure. These varia-tions represent subclasses within the LDL class. Serumfrom a person with a large amount of LDL will be clear.\nLDL carries cholesterol in the blood and deposits it\nin body tissues and in the walls of blood vessels, a condi-tion known as atherosclerosis . The amount of LDL in a\nperson’s blood is directly related to his or her risk of car-diovascular disease. The higher the LDL level, thegreater the risk. LDL is the lipoprotein class most used totrigger and monitor cholesterol lowering therapy.\nHigh-density lipoproteins (HDL)\nHDL is often called “good” cholesterol. HDL\nremoves excess cholesterol from tissues and vessel wallsand carries it to the liver, where it is removed from theblood and discarded. The amount of HDL in a person’sblood is inversely related to his or her risk of cardiovas-cular disease. The lower the HDL level, the greater therisk; the higher the level, the lower the risk. The smallestlipoprotein, it contains 20-30% of a person’s total choles-terol and can be separated into two major subclasses.\nLipoprotein(a)\nLipoprotein(a) is found in lower concentrations than\nother lipoproteins, yet it carries a unique and significantrisk for cardiovascular disease. Because of its similarityto LDL, test methods often don’t measure it separately,but include it within the LDL class. Testing specificallyfor this class may uncover why a person is not respond-ing to standard cholesterol-lowering treatment. Highlipoprotein(a) levels may not respond to treatment aimedat high LDL.\nMeasurement guidelines\nThe Expert Panel of the National Cholesterol Educa-\ntion Program (NCEP) sponsored by the National Insti-tutes of Health has published guidelines for the detectionof high cholesterol in adults. The NCEP panel recom-\nmends that adults over the age of 20 be tested for choles-terol and HDL every five years. If the cholesterol is high,the HDL is low (below 35 mg/dl), or other risk factorsare present, a complete lipoprotein profile that includestotal cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and calculated LDLshould be done.\nMeasurement methods\nThere are a variety of methods to measure the\nlipoprotein classes. All require separation of the classes\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2007Lipoproteins testbefore they can be measured. One way to separate them\nis by spinning serum (the yellow, watery liquid that sepa-rates from the cells when blood clots) for a long time in ahigh-speed centrifuge (called ultracentrifugation). Themost dense classes will settle towards the bottom, theleast dense towards the top. Following centrifugation, themost complete measurement of all the lipoprotein classesis done using electrophoresis. This procedure measuresthe quantity of each lipoprotein class based on its move-ment in an electrical field.\nOther, less extensive procedures are also used. For\nexample, if only HDL is to be measured, a chemical isadded to the serum that will clump the other classes,leaving HDL free in the serum to be measured by achemical method. LDL often is not measured directly butits level is calculated based on the measurements of totalcholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. The formula iscalled the Friedewald formula: LDL = total cholesterol -HDL - (triglycerides/5). The calculated result will beinaccurate in a person with high triglycerides. Results areusually available the same or following day.\nPreparation\nThe patient must fast for 12 hours before the test,\neating nothing and drinking only water. The personshould not have alcohol for 24 hours before the test.There should be a stable diet and no illnesses occurringin the preceding two weeks.\nA lipoproteins test requires 5 mL (milliliters) of\nblood. A person’s physical position while having bloodcollected affects the results. Values from blood drawnwhile a person is sitting may be different from thosewhile the person is standing. If repeated testing is done,the person should be in same position each time.\nAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site relieve discomfort.\nNormal results\nPeople with HDL levels between 45 mg/dl and 59\nmg/dl carry an average risk for cardiovascular disease.People with HDL levels above 60 mg/dl have a negativerisk factor and appear to be protected from cardiovascu-lar disease.\nLDL levels below 130 mg/dl are desirable.Some people have normal variations in their lipopro-\ntein and total cholesterol levels.

    "title": "Liposuction",
    "content": "Liposuction\nDefinition\nLiposuction, also known as lipoplasty or suction-\nassisted lipectomy, is cosmetic surgery performed toremove unwanted deposits of fat from under the skin.The doctor sculpts and recontours the patient’s body byremoving excess fat deposits that have been resistant toreduction by diet or exercise . The fat is permanently\nremoved from under the skin with a suction device.\nPurpose\nLiposuction is intended to reduce and smooth the\ncontours of the body and improve the patient’s appear-ance. Its goal is cosmetic improvement. It is the mostcommonly performed cosmetic procedure in the UnitedStates.\nLiposuction does not remove large quantities of fat\nand is not intended as a weight reduction technique. Theaverage amount of fat removed is about a liter, or a quart.Although liposuction is not intended to remove cellulite(lumpy fat), some doctors believe that it improves theappearance of cellulite areas (thighs, hips, buttocks,abdomen, and chin).\nA new technique called liposhaving shows more\npromise at reducing cellulite.\nPrecautions\nLiposuction is most successful on patients who have\nfirm, elastic skin and concentrated pockets of fat in cel-lultite areas. To get good results after fat removal, theskin must contract to conform to the new contours with-out sagging. Older patients have less elastic skin andtherefore may not be good candidates for this procedure.Patients with generalized fat distribution, rather thanlocalized pockets, are not good candidates.\nPatients should be in good general health and free of\nheart or lung disease. Patients with poor circulation orwho have had recent surgery at the intended site of fatreduction are not good candidates.Description\nMost liposuction procedures are performed under\nlocal anesthesia (loss of sensation without loss of con-sciousness) by the tumescent or wet technique. In thistechnique, large volumes of very dilute local anesthetic(a substance that produces anesthesia) are injectedunder the patient’s skin, making the tissue swollen andfirm. Epinephrine is added to the solution to reducebleeding, and make possible the removal of largeramounts of fat.\nThe doctor first numbs the skin with an injection of\nlocal anesthetic. After the skin is desensitized, the doc-tor makes a series of tiny incisions, usually 0.12-0.25 in(3-6 mm) in length. The area is then flooded with alarger amount of local anesthetic. Fat is then extractedwith suction through a long, blunt hollow tube called acannula. The doctor repeatedly pushes the cannulathrough the fat layers in a radiating pattern creating tun-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2009Liposuction\n“Before” photo of patient undergoing liposuction. (Photo-\ngraph by I. Richard Toranto, M.D., Custom Medical Stock Photo.Reproduced by permission.)nels, removing fat, and recontouring the area. Large\nquantities of intravenous fluid (IV) is given during theprocedure to replace lost body fluid. Blood transfusionsare possible.\nSome newer modifications to the procedure\ninvolve the use of a cutting cannula called a liposhaver,or the use of ultrasound to help break up the fatdeposits. The patient is awake and comfortable duringthese procedures.\nThe length of time required to perform the proce-\ndure varies with the amount of fat that is to be removedand the number of areas to be treated. Most operationstake from 30 minutes to two hours, but extensive pro-cedures can take longer. The length of time requiredalso varies with the manner in which the anesthetic isinjected.\nThe cost of liposuction can vary depending upon the\nstandardized fees in the region of the country where it isperformed, the extent of the area being treated, and theperson performing the procedure. Generally, small areas,\nsuch as the chin or knees, can be done for as little as$500, while more extensive treatment, such as whenhips, thighs, and abdomen are done simultaneously, cancost as much as $10,000. These procedures are cosmeticand are not covered by most insurance policies.\nPreparation\nThe doctor will do a physical exam and may order\nblood work to determine clotting time and hemoglobinlevel for transfusions should the need arise. The patientmay be placed on antibiotics immediately prior to\nsurgery to ward off infection.\nAftercare\nAfter the surgery, the patient will need to wear a\nsupport garment continuously for two to three weeks. Ifankles or calves were treated, support hose will need tobe worn for up to six weeks. The support garments canbe removed during bathing 24 hours after surgery. Adrainage tube, under the skin in the area of the procedure,may be inserted to prevent fluid build-up.\nMild side effects can include a burning sensation at\nthe site of the surgery for up to one month. The patientshould be prepared for swelling of the tissues below theoperated site for 6-8 weeks after surgery. Wearing thespecial elastic garments will help reduce this swellingand help to achieve the desired final results.\nThe incisions involved in this procedure are tiny, but\nthe surgeon may close them with stitches or staples.These will be removed the day after surgery. However,three out of eight doctors use no sutures. Minor bleedingor seepage through the incision site is common after thisprocedure. Wearing the elastic bandage or support gar-ment helps reduce fluid loss.\nThis operation is virtually painless. However, for\nthe first postoperative day, there may be some discom-fort which will require light pain medication. Soreness\nor aching may persist for several days. The patient canusually return to normal activity within a week. Post-operative bruising will go away by itself within 10-14days. Postoperative swelling begins to go down after aweek. It may take three to six months for the final con-tour to be reached.\nRisks\nLiposuction under local anesthesia using the tumes-\ncent technique is exceptionally safe. A 1995 study of15,336 patients showed no serious complications ordeaths. Another study showed a 1% risk factor. However,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2010Liposuction\n“After” photo of same patient following liposuction. (Photo-\ngraph by I. Richard Toranto, M.D., Custom Medical Stock Photo.Reproduced by permission.)as with any surgery, there are some risks and serious\ncomplications. Death is possible.\nThe main hazards associated with this surgery\ninvolve migration of a blood clot or fat globule to theheart, brain, or lungs. Such an event can cause a heart\nattack ,stroke , or serious lung damage. However, this\ncomplication is rare and did not occur even once in thestudy of 15,336 patients. The risk of blood clot formationis reduced with the wearing of special girdle-like com-pression garments after the surgery, and with the resump-tion of normal mild activity soon after surgery.\nStaying in bed increases the risk of clot formation,\nbut not getting enough rest can result in increasedswelling of the surgical area. Such swelling is a result ofexcess fluid and blood accumulation, and generallycomes from not wearing the compression garments. Ifnecessary, this excess fluid can be drained off with a nee-dle in the doctor’s office.\nInfection is another complication, but this rarely\noccurs. If the physician is skilled and works in a sterileenvironment, infection should not be a concern.\nIf too much fat is removed, the skin may peel in that\narea. Smokers are at increased risk for shedding skinbecause their circulation is impaired. Another and moreserious hazard of removing too much fat is that thepatient may go into shock . Fat tissue has an abundant\nblood supply and removing too much of it at once cancause shock if the fluid is not replaced.\nA rare complication is perforation or puncture of an\norgan. The procedure involves pushing a cannula vigor-ously through the fat layer. If the doctor pushes too hard or\nif the tissue gives way too easily under the force, the blunthollow tube can go too far and injure internal organs.\nLiposuction can damage superficial nerves. Some\npatients lose sensation in the area that has been suc-tioned, but feeling usually returns with time.\nNormal results\nThe loss of fat cells is permanent, and the patient\nshould have smoother, more pleasing body contourswithout excessive bulges. However, if the patientovereats, the remaining fat cells will grow in size.Although the patient may gain weight back, the bodyshould retain the new proportions and the suctioned areashould remain proportionally smaller.\nTiny scars about 0.25-0.5 in (6-12 mm) long at the\nsite of incision are normal. The doctor usually makes theincisions in places where the scars are not likely to show.\nIn some instances, the skin may appear rippled,\nwavy, or baggy after surgery. Pigmentation spots maydevelop. The recontoured area may be uneven. Thisunevenness is common, occurring in 5-20% of the cases,and can be corrected with a second procedure that is lessextensive than the first.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHetter, Gregory P.

The organism can spread to the blood streamand central nervous system. During pregnancy , listerio-\nsis often causes miscarriage or stillbirth .\nDescription\nListeriosis is caused by an infection with the bacteri-\num Listeria monocytogenes . This bacteria can be carried\nby many animals and birds, and it has been found in soil,water, sewage, and animal feed. Five out of every 100people carry Listeria monocytogenes in their intestines.\nListeriosis is considered a “food-borne illness” becausemost people are probably infected after eating food cont-aminated with Listeria monocytogenes . However, a\nwoman can pass the bacteria to her baby during pregnan-cy. In addition, there have been a few cases where work-ers have developed Listeria skin infections by touching\ninfected calves or poultry.\nIn the 1980s, the United States government began\ntaking measures to decrease the occurrence of listeriosis.Processed meats and dairy products are now tested forthe presence of Listeria monocytogenes . The Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) and the Food Safety andInspection Service (FSIS) can legally prevent food frombeing shipped, or order food recalls, if they detect anyListeria bacteria. These inspections, in combination with\nthe public education regarding the proper handling ofuncooked foods, appear to be working. In 1989, therewere 1,965 cases of listeriosis with 481 deaths. In 1993,the numbers fell to 1,092 cases with 248 deaths.\nIn 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion (CDC) began a nationwide food-borne disease sur-veillance program called “FoodNet,” in which sevenstates were participating by January 1997. Results fromthe program indicated that, in 1996, one person out ofevery 200,000 people got listeriosis. FoodNet alsorevealed that the hospitalization rate was higher for liste-riosis (94%) than for any other food-borne illness. Inaddition, FoodNet found that the Listeria bacteria reached\nthe blood and cerebrospinal fluid in 89% of cases, a high-er percentage than in any other food-borne illness.\nPersons at particular risk for listeriosis include the\nelderly, pregnant women, newborns, and those with aweakened immune system (called “immunocompro-mised”). Risk is increased when a person suffers fromdiseases such as AIDS ,cancer , kidney disease, diabetes\nmellitus , or by the use of certain medications. Infection\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2012Listeriosisis most common in babies younger than one month old\nand adults over 60 years of age. Pregnant women accountfor 27% of the cases and immunocompromised personsaccount for almost 70%. Persons with AIDS are 280times more likely to get listeriosis than others.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs noted, persons become infected with Listeria\nmonocytogenes by eating contaminated food. Listeria\nhas been found on raw vegetables, fish, poultry, raw(unpasteurized) milk, fresh meat, processed meat (suchas deli meat, hot dogs, and canned meat), and certain softcheeses. Listeriosis outbreaks in the United States sincethe 1980s have been linked to cole slaw, milk, Mexican-style cheese, undercooked hot dogs, undercooked chick-en, and delicatessen foods. Unlike most other bacteria,Listeria monocytogenes does not stop growing when\nfood is in the refrigerator—its growth is merely slowed.Fortunately, typical cooking temperatures and the pas-teurization process do kill this bacteria.\nListeria bacteria can pass through the wall of the\nintestines, and from there they can get into the bloodstream. Once in the blood stream, they can be transportedanywhere in the body, but are commonly found the cen-tral nervous system (brain and spinal cord); and in preg-nant women they are often found in the placenta (theorgan which connects the baby’s umbilical cord to theuterus). Listeria monocytogenes live inside specific white\nblood cells called macrophages. Inside macrophages, thebacteria can hide from immune responses and becomeinaccessible to certain antibiotics . Listeria bacteria are\ncapable of multiplying within macrophages, and thenmay spread to other macrophages.\nAfter consuming food contaminated with this bacteria,\nsymptoms of infection may appear anywhere from 11-70days later. Most people do not get any noticeable symp-toms. Scientists are unsure, but they believe that Listeria\nmonocytogenes can cause upset stomach and intestinal\nproblems just like other food-borne illnesses. Persons withlisteriosis may develop flu-like symptoms such as fever ,\nheadache ,nausea and vomiting , tiredness, and diarrhea .\nPregnant women experience a mild, flu-like illness\nwith fever, muscle aches, upset stomach, and intestinalproblems. They recover, but the infection can cause mis-carriage, premature labor , early rupture of the birth sac,\nand stillbirth. Unfortunately, half of the newborns infect-ed with Listeria will die from the illness.\nThere are two types of listeriosis in the newborn\nbaby: early-onset disease and late-onset disease. Early-onset disease refers to a serious illness that is present atbirth and usually causes the baby to be born prematurely.Babies infected during the pregnancy usually have ablood infection ( sepsis ) and may have a serious, whole\nbody infection called granulomatosis infantisepticum.When a full-term baby becomes infected with Listeria\nduring childbirth , that situation is called late-onset dis-\nease. Commonly, symptoms of late-onset listeriosisappear about two weeks after birth. Babies with late-termdisease typically have meningitis (inflammation of the\nbrain and spinal tissues); yet they have a better chance ofsurviving than those with early-onset disease.\nImmunocompromised adults are at risk for a serious\ninfection of the blood stream and central nervous system(brain and spinal cord). Meningitis occurs in about halfof the cases of adult listeriosis. Symptoms of listerialmeningitis occur about four days after the flu-like symp-toms and include fever, personality change, uncoordinat-ed muscle movement, tremors , muscle contractions,\nseizures, and slipping in and out of consciousness.\nListeria monocytogenes causes endocarditis in\nabout 7.5% of the cases. Endocarditis is an inflammationof heart tissue due to the bacterial infection. Listerialendocarditis causes death in about half of the patients.\nOther diseases which have been caused by Listeria\nmonocytogenes include brain abscess , eye infection,\nhepatitis (liver disease), peritonitis (abdominal infec-\ntion), lung infection, joint infection, arthritis, heart dis-ease, bone infection, and gallbladder infection.\nDiagnosis\nListeriosis may be diagnosed and treated by infec-\ntious disease specialists and internal medicine special-ists. The diagnosis and treatment of this infection shouldbe covered by most insurance providers.\nThe only way to diagnose listeriosis is to isolate Lis-\nteria monocytogenes from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or\nstool. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed fromthe spinal cord using a needle and syringe. This proce-dure is commonly called a spinal tap. The amniotic fluid(the fluid which bathes the unborn baby) may be tested inpregnant women with listeriosis. This sample is obtainedby inserting a needle through the abdomen into the uterusand withdrawing fluid. Listeria grows well in laboratory\nmedia and test results can be available within a few days.\nTreatment\nListeriosis is treated with the antibiotics ampicillin\n(Omnipen) or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Bactrim,Septra). Because the bacteria live within macrophagecells, treatment may be difficult and the treatment peri-ods may vary. Usually, pregnant women are treated fortwo weeks; newborns, two to three weeks; adults withmild disease, two to four weeks; persons with meningitis,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2013Listeriosisthree weeks; persons with brain abscesses, six weeks;\nand persons with endocarditis, four to six weeks.\nPatients are often hospitalized for treatment and\nmonitoring. Other drugs may be provided to relieve pain\nand fever and to treat other reactions to the infection.\nPrognosis\nThe overall death rate for listeriosis is 26%. This\nhigh death rate is due to the serious illness suffered bynewborns, the elderly, and immunocompromised per-sons. Healthy adults and older children have a low deathrate. Complications of Listeria infection include: menin-\ngitis, sepsis, miscarriage, stillbirth, pneumonia ,shock ,\nendocarditis, abscess (localized infection) formation,\nand eye inflammation.\nPrevention\nThe United States government has already done\nmuch to prevent listeriosis. Persons at extremely highrisk (pregnant women, immunocompromised persons,etc.) must use extra caution. High risk persons should:avoid soft cheeses, such as Mexican cheese, feta, Brie,Camembert, and blue cheese (cottage cheese is safe),thoroughly cook leftovers and ready-to-eat foods (suchas hot-dogs), and avoid foods from the deli.\nFor all people, the risk of listeriosis can be reduced\nby taking these precautions:\n• completely cook all meats and eggs\n• carefully wash raw vegetables before eating• keep raw meat away from raw vegetables and prepared\nfoods. After cutting raw meat, wash the cutting boardwith detergent before using it for vegetables\n• avoid drinking unpasteurized milk or foods made from\nsuch milk\n• wash hands thoroughly after handling raw meat• follow the instructions on food labels.

    "title": "Lithotripsy",
    "content": "Lithotripsy\nDefinition\nLithotripsy is the use of high-energy shock waves to\nfragment and disintegrate kidney stones . The shock\nwave, created by using a high-voltage spark or an elec-tromagnetic impulse, is focused on the stone. This shockwave shatters the stone and this allows the fragments topass through the urinary system. Since the shock wave isgenerated outside the body, the procedure is termedextracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, or ESWL.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2014LithotripsyPurpose\nESWL is used when a kidney stone is too large to\npass on its own, or when a stone becomes stuck in a ureter(a tube which carries urine from the kidney to the bladder)and will not pass. Kidney stones are extremely painful andcan cause serious medical complications if not removed.\nPrecautions\nESWL should not be considered for patients with\nsevere skeletal deformities, patients weighing over 300 lb(136 kg), patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, orpatients with uncontrollable bleeding disorders. Patientswho are pregnant should not be treated with ESWL.Patients with cardiac pacemakers should be evaluated\nby a cardiologist familiar with ESWL. The cardiologistshould be present during the ESWL procedure in theevent the pacemaker needs to be overridden.\nDescription\nLithotripsy uses the technique of focused shock\nwaves to fragment a stone in the kidney or the ureter. Thepatient is placed in a tub of water or in contact with a\nwater-filled cushion, and a shock wave is created whichis focused on the stone. The wave shatters and fragmentsthe stone. The resulting debris, called gravel, then passesthrough the remainder of the ureter, through the bladder,and through the urethra during urination. There is mini-mal chance of damage to skin or internal organs becausebiologic tissues are resilient, not brittle, and because thethe shock waves are not focused on them.\nPreparation\nPrior to the lithotripsy procedure, a complete physical\nexamination is done, followed by tests to determine the\nnumber, location, and size of the stone or stones. A testcalled an intravenous pyelogram, or IVP, is used to locatethe stones. An IVP involves injecting a dye into a vein inthe arm. This dye, which shows up on x ray, travels throughthe bloodstream and is excreted by the kidneys. The dyethen flows down the ureters and into the bladder. The dyesurrounds the stones, and x rays are then used to evaluatethe stones and the anatomy of the urinary system. (Somepeople are allergic to the dye material, so it cannot be used.For these people, focused sound waves, called ultrasound,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2015Lithotripsy\nA lithotriptor in use by patient in tub.This noninvasive method crushes kidney stones through shock waves.

For women of childbearing age, a pregnancy\ntest is done to make sure the patient isn’t pregnant; andelderly patients have an EKG done to make sure no poten-tial heart problems exist. Some patients may have a stentplaced prior to the lithotripsy procedure. A stent is a plastictube placed in the ureter which allows the passage of graveland urine after the ESWL procedure is completed.\nAftercare\nMost patients have a lot of blood in their urine after\nthe ESWL procedure. This is normal and should clearafter several days to a week or so. Lots of fluids shouldbe taken to encourage the flushing of any gravel remain-ing in the urinary system. The patient should follow upwith the urologist in about two weeks to make sure thateverything is going as planned. If a stent has been insert-ed, it is normally removed at this time. Patients mayreturn to work whenever they feel able.\nRisks\nAbdominal pain is not uncommon after ESWL, but it\nis usually not cause to worry. However, persistent or severeabdominal pain may imply unexpected internal injury. Col-icky renal pain is very common as gravel is still passing.Other problems may include perirenal hematomas (bloodclots near the kidneys) in 66% of the cases; nerve palsies;KEY TERMS\nAneurysm —A dilation of the wall of an artery\nwhich causes a weak area prone to rupturing.\nBladder —Organ in which urine is stored prior to\nurination.\nBleeding disorder —Problems in the clotting mech-\nanism of the blood.\nCardiologist —A physician who specializes in prob-\nlems of the heart.\nEKG—A tracing of the electrical activity of the\nheart.\nESWL (Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) —\nThe use of focused shock waves, generated outsidethe body, to fragment kidney stones.\nGravel —The debris which is formed from a frag-\nmented kidney stone.\nIVP (Intravenous pyelogram) —The use of a dye,\ninjected into the veins, used to locate kidneystones.

    "title": "Liver biopsy",
    "content": "Liver biopsy\nDefinition\nA liver biopsy is a medical procedure performed to\nobtain a small piece of liver tissue for diagnostic testing.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2016Liver biopsyLiver biopsies are sometimes called percutaneous liver\nbiopsies, because the tissue sample is obtained by goingthrough the patient’s skin.\nPurpose\nA liver biopsy is usually done to diagnose a tumor,\nor to evaluate the extent of damage that has occurred tothe liver because of chronic disease. Biopsies are oftenperformed to identify abnormalities in liver tissues afterimaging studies have failed to yield clear results.\nA liver biopsy may be ordered to evaluate any of the\nfollowing conditions or disorders:\n• jaundice\n•cirrhosis\n• hemochromatosis, which is a condition of excess iron\nin the liver\n• repeated abnormal results from liver function tests\n• unexplained swelling or enlargement of the liver\n• primary cancers of the liver, such as hepatomas, cho-\nlangiocarcinomas, and angiosarcomas\n• metastatic cancers of the liver\nPrecautions\nSome patients should not have percutaneous liver\nbiopsies. They include patients with any of the followingconditions:\n•a  platelet count below 60,000\n• a longer-than-normal prothrombin time\n• a liver tumor that contains a large number of blood ves-\nsels\n• a history of unexplained bleeding• a watery (hydatid) cyst• an infection in either the cavity around the lungs, or the\ndiaphragm\nDescription\nPercutaneous liver biopsy is done with a special hol-\nlow needle, called a Menghini needle, attached to a suc-tion syringe. Doctors who specialize in the digestive sys-tem or liver will sometimes perform liver biopsies. But inmost cases, a radiologist (a doctor who specializes in xrays and imaging studies) performs the biopsy. The radi-ologist will use computed tomography scan (CT scan) orultrasound to guide the choice of the site for the biopsy.\nAn hour or so before the biopsy, the patient may be\ngiven a sedative to help relaxation. He or she is then askedto lie on the back with the right elbow to the side and theright hand under the head. The patient is instructed to lie as\nstill as possible during the procedure. He or she is warnedto expect a sensation resembling a punch in the right shoul-der, but to hold still in spite of the momentary feeling.\nThe doctor marks a spot on the skin where the nee-\ndle will be inserted and thoroughly cleanses the right sideof the upper abdomen with an antiseptic solution. Thepatient is then given an anesthetic at the biopsy site.\nThe needle with attached syringe is inserted into the\npatient’s chest wall. The doctor then draws the plunger ofthe syringe back to create a vacuum. At this point thepatient is asked to take a deep breath, exhale the air andhold their breath at the point of complete exhalation. Theneedle is inserted into the liver and withdrawn quickly,usually within two seconds or less. The negative pressurein the syringe draws or pulls a sample of liver tissue intothe biopsy needle. As soon as the needle is withdrawn,the patient can breathe normally. Pressure is applied atthe biopsy site to stop any bleeding, and a bandage willbe placed over it. The entire procedure takes 10 to 15minutes. Test results are usually available within a day.\nPreparation\nAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are known to thin the bloodand interfere with clotting. These medications should beavoided for at least a week before the biopsy. Four toeight hours before the biopsy, patients should stop eatingand drinking.\nThe patient’s blood will be tested prior to the biopsy\nto make sure that it is clotting normally. Tests willinclude a platelet count and a prothrombin time. Doctorswill also ensure that the patient is not taking any othermedications, such as blood thinners like Coumadin, thatmight affect blood clotting.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2017Liver biopsy\nA false color image of hepatocyte cells of the liver that\nsecrete bile. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by per-\nmission.)Aftercare\nLiver biopsies are outpatient procedures in most\nhospitals. After the biopsy, patients are usually instructedto lie on their right side for about two hours. This pro-vides pressure to the biopsy site and helps prevent bleed-ing. A nurse will check the patient’s vital signs at regularintervals. If there are no complications, the patient is senthome within about four to eight hours.\nPatients should arrange to have a friend or relative\ntake them home after discharge. Bed rest for a day is rec-ommended, followed by a week of avoiding heavy workor strenuous exercise . The patient can resume eating a\nnormal diet.\nSome mild soreness in the area of the biopsy is nor-\nmal after the anesthetic wears off. Irritation of the mus-cle that lies over the liver can also cause mild discomfortin the shoulder for some patients. Tylenol can be takenfor minor soreness, but aspirin and NSAIDs are bestavoided. Patients should call their doctor if they havesevere pain in the abdomen, chest or shoulder, difficulty\nbreathing, or persistent bleeding. These signs may indi-cate that there has been leakage of bile into the abdomi-nal cavity, or that air has been introduced into the cavityaround the lungs.\nRisks\nThe risks of a liver biopsy are usually very small.\nWhen complications do occur, over 90% are apparentwithin 24 hours after the biopsy. The most significantrisk is internal bleeding. Bleeding is most likely tooccur in elderly patients, in patients with cirrhosis, orin patients with a tumor that has many blood vessels.Other complications from percutaneous liver biopsiesinclude the leakage of bile or the introduction of airinto the chest cavity ( pneumothorax ). There is also a\nsmall chance that an infection may occur, or an internalorgan such as the lung, gall bladder, or kidney could bepunctured.\nNormal results\nAfter the biopsy, the liver sample is sent to the\npathology laboratory for study under a microscope. Anormal (negative) result would find no evidence of can-\nceror other disease in the tissue sample.\nAbnormal results\nChanges in liver tissue that are visible under the\nmicroscope indicate abnormal results. Possible causesfor the abnormality include the presence of a tumor, or adisease such as hepatitis.KEY TERMS\nBiopsy —A procedure where a piece of tissue is\nremoved from a patient for diagnostic testing.\nMenghini needle —A special needle used to\nobtain a sample of liver tissue.\nPercutaneous biopsy —A biopsy in which a needle\nis inserted and a tissue sample removed throughthe skin.\nProthrombin time —A blood test that determines\nhow quickly a person’s blood will clot.\nVital signs —A person’s essential body functions,\nusually defined as the pulse, body temperature,and breathing rate.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrown, Kyle E., et al. “Liver Biopsy: Indications, Technique,\nComplications and Interpretation” In Liver Disease.

    "title": "Liver cancer",
    "content": "Liver cancer\nDefinition\nLiver cancer is a form of cancer with a high mortali-\nty rate. Liver cancers can be classified into two types.They are either primary, when the cancer starts in the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2018Liver cancerliver itself, or metastatic, when the cancer has spread to\nthe liver from some other part of the body.\nDescription\nPrimary liver cancer\nPrimary liver cancer is a relatively rare disease in the\nUnited States, representing about 2% of all malignanciesand 4% of newly diagnosed cancers. Hepatocellular carci-noma is one of the top eight most common cancers in theworld. It is, however, much more common outside theUnited States, representing 10% to 50% of malignancies inAfrica and parts of Asia. Rates of HCC in men are at leasttwo to three times higher than for women. In high-riskareas (East and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa), menare even more likely to have HCC than women.\nTYPES OF PRIMARY LIVER CANCER. In adults, most\nprimary liver cancers belong to one of two types:hepatomas, or hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), whichstart in the liver tissue itself; and cholangiomas, orcholangiocarcinomas, which are cancers that develop inthe bile ducts inside the liver. About 80% to 90% of pri-mary liver cancers are hepatomas. In the United States,about five persons in every 200,000 will develop ahepatoma (70% to 75% of cases of primary liver cancersare HCC). In Africa and Asia, over 40 persons in 200,000will develop this form of cancer (more than 90% of casesof primary liver are HCC). Two rare types of primary livercancer are mixed-cell tumors and Kupffer cell sarcomas.\nOne type of primary liver cancer, called a hepato-\nblastoma, usually occurs in children younger than fouryears of age and between the ages of 12 and 15. Unlikeliver cancers in adults, hepatoblastomas have a goodchance of being treated successfully. Approximately70% of children with hepatoblastomas experience com-plete cures. If the tumor is detected early, the survivalrate is over 90%.\nMetastatic liver cancer\nThe second major category of liver cancer, metastat-\nic liver cancer, is about 20 times as common in the Unit-ed States as primary liver cancer. Because blood from allparts of the body must pass through the liver for filtra-tion, cancer cells from other organs and tissues easilyreach the liver, where they can lodge and grow into sec-ondary tumors. Primary cancers in the colon, stomach,pancreas, rectum, esophagus, breast, lung, or skin are themost likely to metastasize (spread) to the liver. It is notunusual for the metastatic cancer in the liver to be thefirst noticeable sign of a cancer that started in anotherorgan. After cirrhosis, metastatic liver cancer is the mostcommon cause of fatal liver disease.Causes and symptoms\nRisk factors\nThe exact cause of primary liver cancer is still\nunknown. In adults, however, certain factors are knownto place some individuals at higher risk of developingliver cancer. These factors include:\n• Male sex.\n• Age over 60 years.\n• Exposure to substances in the environment that tend to\ncause cancer (carcinogens). These include: a substanceproduced by a mold that grows on rice and peanuts(aflatoxin); thorium dioxide, which was once used as acontrast dye for x rays of the liver; vinyl chloride, usedin manufacturing plastics; and cigarette smoking.\n• Use of oral estrogens for birth control.• Hereditary hemochromatosis. This is a disorder charac-\nterized by abnormally high levels of iron storage in thebody. It often develops into cirrhosis.\n• Cirrhosis. Hepatomas appear to be a frequent complica-\ntion of cirrhosis of the liver. Between 30% and 70% ofhepatoma patients also have cirrhosis. It is estimated thata patient with cirrhosis has 40 times the chance of devel-oping a hepatoma than a person with a healthy liver.\n• Exposure to hepatitis viruses: Hepatitis B (HBV),\nHepatitis C (HCV), Hepatitis D (HDV), or Hepatitis G(HGV). It is estimated that 80% of worldwide HCC isassociated with chronic HBV infection. In Africa andmost of Asia, exposure to hepatitis B is an important fac-tor; in Japan and some Western countries, exposure tohepatitis C is connected with a higher risk of developingliver cancer. In the United States, nearly 25% of patientswith liver cancer show evidence of HBV infection.Hepatitis is commonly found among intravenous drugabusers. The 70% increase in HCC incidence in the Unit-ed States is thought to be due to increasing rates of HBVand HCV infections due to increased sexual promiscuityand illicit drug needle sharing. The association betweenHDV and HGV and HCC is unclear at this time.\nSymptoms of liver cancer\nThe early symptoms of primary, as well as metastat-\nic, liver cancer are often vague and not unique to liverdisorders. The long period between the beginning of thetumor’s growth and the first signs of illness is the majorreason why the disease has such a high mortality rate. Atthe time of diagnosis, patients are often fatigued, withfever, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. They maylook emaciated and generally ill. As the tumor enlarges,it stretches the membrane surrounding the liver (the cap-sule), causing pain in the upper abdomen on the right\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2019Liver cancerside. The pain may extend into the back and shoulder.\nSome patients develop a collection of fluid, known asascites, in the abdominal cavity. Others may show signsof bleeding into the digestive tract. In addition, the tumormay block the ducts of the liver or the gall bladder, lead-ing to jaundice. In patients with jaundice, the whites ofthe eyes and the skin may turn yellow, and the urinebecomes dark–colored.\nDiagnosis\nPhysical examination\nIf the doctor suspects a diagnosis of liver cancer, he\nor she will check the patient’s history for risk factors andpay close attention to the condition of the patient’sabdomen during the physical examination. Masses orlumps in the liver and ascites can often be felt while thepatient is lying flat on the examination table. The liver isusually swollen and hard in patients with liver cancer; itmay be sore when the doctor presses on it. In some cases,the patient’s spleen is also enlarged. The doctor may beable to hear an abnormal sound (bruit) or rubbing noise(friction rub) if he or she uses a stethoscope to listen tothe blood vessels that lie near the liver. The noises arecaused by the pressure of the tumor on the blood vessels.\nLaboratory tests\nBlood tests may be used to test liver function or to\nevaluate risk factors in the patient’s history. Between50% and 75% of primary liver cancer patients haveabnormally high blood serum levels of a particular pro-tein (alpha-fetoprotein or AFP). The AFP test, however,cannot be used by itself to confirm a diagnosis of livercancer, because cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis can alsoproduce high alpha–fetoprotein levels. Tests for alkalinephosphatase, bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase, and otherchemicals indicate that the liver is not functioning nor-mally. About 75% of patients with liver cancer show evi-dence of hepatitis infection. Again, however, abnormalliver function test results are not specific for liver cancer.\nImaging studies\nImaging studies are useful in locating specific areas\nof abnormal tissue in the liver. Liver tumors as small as aninch across can now be detected by ultrasound or comput-ed tomography scan (CT scan). Imaging studies, however,cannot tell the difference between a hepatoma and otherabnormal masses or lumps of tissue (nodules) in the liver.A sample of liver tissue for biopsy is needed to make thedefinitive diagnosis of a primary liver cancer. CT or ultra-sound can be used to guide the doctor in selecting the bestlocation for obtaining the biopsy sample.Chest x rays may be used to see whether the liver\ntumor is primary or has metastasized from a primarytumor in the lungs.\nLiver biopsy\nLiver biopsy is considered to provide the definite\ndiagnosis of liver cancer. A sample of the liver or tissuefluid is removed with a fine needle and is checked undera microscope for the presence of cancer cells. In about70% of cases, the biopsy is positive for cancer. In mostcases, there is little risk to the patient from the biopsyprocedure. In about 0.4% of cases, however, the patientdevelops a fatal hemorrhage from the biopsy becausesome tumors are supplied with a large number of bloodvessels and bleed very easily.\nLaparoscopy\nThe doctor may also perform a laparoscopy to help\nin the diagnosis of liver cancer. First, the doctor makes asmall cut in the patient’s abdomen and inserts a small,lighted tube called a laparoscope to view the area. Asmall piece of liver tissue is removed and examinedunder a microscope for the presence of cancer cells.\nClinical staging\nCurrently, the pathogenesis of HCC is not well\nunderstood. It is not clear how the different risk factorsfor HCC affect each other. In addition, the environmentalfactors vary from region to region.\nTreatment\nTreatment of liver cancer is based on several factors,\nincluding the type of cancer (primary or metastatic);stage (early or advanced); the location of other primarycancers or metastases in the patient’s body; the patient’sage; and other coexisting diseases, including cirrhosis.For many patients, treatment of liver cancer is primarilyintended to relieve the pain caused by the cancer but can-not cure it.\nSurgery\nFew liver cancers in adults can be cured by surgery\nbecause they are usually too advanced by the time theyare discovered. If the cancer is contained within one lobeof the liver, and if the patient does not have either cirrho-sis, jaundice, or ascites, surgery is the best treatmentoption. Patients who can have their entire tumor removedhave the best chance for survival. Unfortunately, onlyabout 5% of patients with metastatic cancer (from prima-ry tumors in the colon or rectum) fall into this group. If\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2020Liver cancerthe entire visible tumor can be removed, about 25% of\npatients will be cured. The operation that is performed iscalled a partial hepatectomy, or partial removal of theliver. The surgeon will remove either an entire lobe of theliver (a lobectomy) or cut out the area around the tumor(a wedge resection).\nChemotherapy\nSome patients with metastatic cancer of the liver can\nhave their lives prolonged for a few months bychemotherapy, although cure is not possible. If the tumorcannot be removed by surgery, a tube (catheter) can beplaced in the main artery of the liver and an implantableinfusion pump can be installed. The pump allows muchhigher concentrations of the cancer drug to be carried tothe tumor than is possible with chemotherapy carriedthrough the bloodstream. The drug that is used for infu-sion pump therapy is usually floxuridine (FUDR), givenfor 14-day periods alternating with 14-day rests. Sys-temic chemotherapy can also be used to treat liver can-cer. The medications usually used are 5-fluorouracil(Adrucil, Efudex) or methotrexate (MTX, Mexate). Sys-temic chemotherapy does not, however, significantlylengthen the patient’s survival time.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is the use of high-energy rays or\nx-rays to kill cancer cells or to shrink tumors. Its use inliver cancer, however, is only to give short-term relieffrom some of the symptoms. Liver cancers are not sensi-tive to radiation, and radiation therapy will not prolongthe patient’s life.\nLiver transplantation\nRemoval of the entire liver (total hepatectomy) and\nliver transplantation can be used to treat liver cancer.However, there is a high risk of tumor recurrence andmetastases after transplantation.\nOther therapies\nOther therapeutic approaches include:\n• hepatic artery embolization with chemotherapy (che-\nmoembolization)\n• alcohol ablation via ultrasound-guided percutaneous\ninjection\n• ultrasound-guided cryoablation\n• immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies tagged\nwith cytotoxic agents\n• gene therapy with retroviral vectors containing genes\nexpressing cytotoxic agentsKEY TERMS\nAflatoxin —A substance produced by molds that\ngrow on rice and peanuts. Exposure to aflatoxin isthought to explain the high rates of primary livercancer in Africa and parts of Asia.\nAlpha-fetoprotein —A protein in blood serum that\nis found in abnormally high concentrations inmost patients with primary liver cancer.\nCirrhosis —A chronic degenerative disease of the\nliver, in which normal cells are replaced by fibroustissue. Cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the laterdevelopment of liver cancer.\nHepatitis —A viral disease characterized by inflam-\nmation of the liver cells (hepatocytes). Peopleinfected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus are atan increased risk for developing liver cancer.\nMetastatic cancer —A cancer that has spread to an\norgan or tissue from a primary cancer locatedelsewhere in the body.\nAlternative treatment\nMany patients find that alternative and complemen-\ntary therapies help to reduce the stress associated withillness, improve immune function, and boost spirits.While there is no clinical evidence that these therapiesspecifically combat disease, activities such as biofeed-back, relaxation, therapeutic touch, massage therapy andguided imagery have no side effects and have beenreported to enhance well-being.\nSeveral other healing therapies are sometimes used\nas supplemental or replacement cancer treatments, suchas antineoplastons, cancell, cartilage (bovine and shark),laetrile, and mistletoe. Many of these therapies have notbeen the subject of safety and efficacy trials by theNational Cancer Institute (NCI). The NCI has conductedtrials on cancell, laetrile, and other alternative therapiesand found no anticancer activity. These treatments havevarying effectiveness and safety considerations. Patientsusing any alternative remedy should first consult theirdoctor in order to prevent harmful side effects or interac-tions with traditional cancer treatment.\nPrognosis\nLiver cancer has a very poor prognosis because it is\noften not diagnosed until it has metastasized. Fewer than10% of patients survive three years after the initial diag-nosis; the overall five-year survival rate for patients with\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2021Liver cancerhepatomas is around 4%. Most patients with primary\nliver cancer die within several months of diagnosis.Patients with liver cancers that metastasized from can-cers in the colon live slightly longer than those whosecancers spread from cancers in the stomach or pancreas.\nPrevention\nThere are no useful strategies at present for prevent-\ning metastatic cancers of the liver. Primary liver cancers,however, are 75% to 80% preventable. Current strategiesfocus on widespread vaccination for hepatitis B , early\ntreatment of hereditary hemochromatosis, and screeningof high-risk patients with alpha–fetoprotein testing andultrasound examinations.\nLifestyle factors that can be modified in order to pre-\nvent liver cancer include avoidance of exposure to toxicchemicals and foods harboring molds that produce afla-toxin. Most important, however, is avoidance of alcoholand drug abuse. Alcohol abuse is responsible for 60% to75% of cases of cirrhosis, which is a major risk factor foreventual development of primary liver cancer. Hepatitisis a widespread disease among persons who abuse intra-venous drugs.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, et al., eds. “Hepatic and Biliary Disorders:\nNeoplasms of the Liver.” In The Merck Manual of Diag-\nnosis and Therapy.

    "content": "Liver encephalopathy\nDefinition\nLiver encephalopathy is a potentially life-threaten-\ning disease in which toxic substances accumulate in theblood. Also known as hepatic encephalopathy or hepaticcoma , this condition can cause confusion, disorienta-\ntion, abnormal neurological signs, loss of conscious-ness, and death .\nDescription\nA normally functioning liver metabolizes and detox-\nifies substances formed in the body during the digestiveprocess. Impaired liver function allows substances likeammonia (formed when the body digests protein), somefatty acids, phenol, and mercaptans to escape into thebloodstream. From there, they may penetrate the blood-brain barrier, affect the central nervous system (CNS),and lead to hepatic coma.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2022Liver encephalopathyHepatic coma is most common in patients with\nchronic liver disease. It occurs in 50-70% of all thosewith cirrhosis .\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of hepatic coma is unknown, but the con-\ndition is frequently associated with the following condi-tions:\n• acute or chronic liver disease• gastrointestinal bleeding\n• azotemia, the accumulation of nitrogen-containing\ncompounds (such as urea) in the blood\n• inherited disorders that disrupt the process by which\nnitrogen is decomposed and excreted\n• the use of shunts (devices implanted in the body to redi-\nrect the flow of fluid from one vessel to another)\n• electrolyte imbalances, including low levels of potassi-\num ( hypokalemia ) and abnormally alkaline blood pH\n(alkalosis). These imbalances may result from theoveruse of sedatives, analgesics , or diuretics ; reduced\nlevels of oxygen (hypoxia), or withdrawal of excessiveamounts of body fluid (hypovolemia)\n• constipation, which may increase the body’s nitrogen\nload\n• surgery• infection• acute liver disease\nBinge drinking and acute infection are common\ncauses of hepatic coma in patients with long-standingliver disease.\nSymptoms of hepatic encephalopathy range from\nalmost unnoticeable changes in personality, energy lev-els, and thinking patterns to deep coma.\nInability to reproduce a star or other simple design\n(apraxia) and deterioration of handwriting are commonsymptoms of early encephalopathy. Decreased brainfunction can also cause inappropriate behavior, lack ofinterest in personal grooming, mood swings, and unchar-acteristically poor judgment.\nThe patient may be less alert than usual and develop\nnew sleep patterns. Movement and speech may be slowand labored.\nAs the disease progresses, patients become con-\nfused, drowsy, and disoriented. The breath and urineacquires a sweet, musky odor.

In other cases, treatment is designedto improve liver function as much as possible; remove orrelieve factors that worsen symptoms; and decrease thebody’s production of poisonous substances.\nAll non-essential medications are discontinued.

All or most protein is elimi-nated from the diet, and supplemental feeding may benecessary to replenish lost calories. Regular doses ofneomycin (Neobiotic), taken orally or administered tocomatose patients in liquid form through a tube, may beused to decrease production of protein-digesting bacteriain the bowel.\nLactulose, a synthetic sugar, changes the character-\nistics of intestinal bacteria, decreases the amount ofammonia accumulated in the body, and has laxativeproperties. The patient is given hourly doses of lactulosesyrup until diarrhea occurs, then dosage is adjusted to\nmaintain regular bowel function. Lactulose and dietary-protein restrictions may be used to control chronicencephalopathy.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2023Liver encephalopathyPrognosis\nEncephalopathy may be reversible if the responsible\nfactor is identified and removed or treated. Patients whosecondition is the result of chronic liver disease may recov-er completely after the underlying cause is corrected.\nDespite intensive treatment, encephalopathy caused\nby acute liver inflammation (fulminant hepatitis) is fatalfor as many as 80% of patients.

LFTsalso commonly include tests to measure levels of severalenzymes, which are special proteins that help the bodybreak down and use (metabolize) other substances.Enzymes that are often measured in LFTs includegamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT); alanine aminotrans-ferase (ALT or SGPT); aspartate aminotransferase (ASTor SGOT); and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). LFTs alsomay include prothrombin time (PT), a measure of how\nlong it takes for the blood to clot.\nPurpose\nLiver function tests are used to aid in the differential\ndiagnosis of liver disease and injury, and to help monitorresponse to treatment.\nPrecautions\nBilirubin: Drugs that may cause increased blood lev-\nels of total bilirubin include anabolic steroids, antibiotics ,\nantimalarials, ascorbic acid, Diabinese, codeine, diuretics ,\nepinephrine, oral contraceptives , and vitamin A.\nAmmonia: Muscular exertion can increase ammonia\nlevels, while cigarette smoking produces significant\nincreases within one hour of inhalation. Drugs that maycause increased levels include alcohol, barbiturates ,\nnarcotics, and diuretics. Drugs that may decrease levelsinclude broad-spectrum antibiotics, levodopa, lactobacil-lus, and potassium salts.\nALT: Drugs that may increase ALT levels include\nacetaminophen , ampicillin, codeine, dicumarol,\nindomethacin, methotrexate, oral contraceptives, tetra-\ncyclines , and verapamil. Previous intramuscular injec-\ntions may cause elevated levels.\nGGT: Drugs that may cause increased GGT levels\ninclude alcohol, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Drugs thatmay cause decreased levels include oral contraceptives.\nDescription\nThe liver is one of the most important organs in the\nbody. As the body’s “chemical factory,” it regulates thelevels of most of the main blood chemicals and acts withthe kidneys to clear the blood of drugs and toxic sub-stances. The liver metabolizes these products, alters their\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2024Liver function testschemical structure, makes them water soluble, and\nexcretes them in bile.\nLiver function tests are used to determine if the liver\nhas been damaged or its function impaired. Elevations ofcertain liver tests in relation to others aids in that deter-mination. For example, aminotransferases (whichinclude ALT and AST) are notably elevated in liver dam-age caused by liver cell disease (hepatocellular disease).However, in intrahepatic obstructive disease—whichmay be caused by some drugs or biliary cirrhosis—thealkaline phosphatases are most abnormal.\nAlanine aminotransferase\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT), formerly called\nserum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, or SGPT, is anenzyme necessary for energy production. It is present ina number of tissues, including the liver, heart, and skele-tal muscles, but is found in the highest concentration inthe liver. Because of this, it is used in conjunction withother liver enzymes to detect liver disease, especiallyhepatitis or cirrhosis without jaundice . Additionally, in\nconjunction with the aspartate aminotransferase test\n(AST), it helps to distinguish between heart damage andliver tissue damage.\nAspartate aminotransferase\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST), formerly called\nserum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or SGOT, isanother enzyme necessary for energy production. It, too,may be elevated in liver and heart disease. In liver dis-ease, the AST increase is usually less than the ALTincrease. However, in liver disease caused by alcoholuse, the AST increase may be two or three times greaterthan the ALT increase.\nAlkaline phosphatase\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels usually include\ntwo similar enzymes (isoenzymes) that mainly comefrom the liver and bone and from the placenta in pregnantwomen. In some cases, doctors may order a test to differ-entiate between the alkaline phosphatase that originatesin the liver and the alkaline phosphatase originating inbone. If a person has elevated ALP, does not have bonedisease and is not pregnant, he or she may have a prob-lem with the biliary tract, the system that makes andstores bile. (Bile is made in the liver, then passes throughducts to the gall bladder, where it is stored.)\nGamma-glutamyl transferase\nGamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), sometimes\ncalled gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGPT), is anenzyme that is compared with ALP levels to distinguish\nbetween skeletal disease and liver disease. Because GGTis not increased in bone disorders, as is ALP, a normalGGT with an elevated ALP would indicate bone disease.Conversely, because the GGT is more specifically relatedto the liver, an elevated GGT with an elevated ALPwould strengthen the diagnosis of liver or bile-duct dis-ease. The GGT has also been used as an indicator ofheavy and chronic alcohol use, but its value in these situ-ations has been questioned recently. It is also commonlyelevated in patients with infectious mononucleosis .\nBilirubin\nBilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin, is the\npredominant pigment in a substance produced by the livercalled bile. Excess bilirubin causes yellowing of body tis-sues (jaundice). There are two tests for bilirubin: direct-reacting (conjugated) and indirect-reacting (unconjugated).Differentiating between the two is important diagnostically,as elevated levels of indirect bilirubin are usually caused byliver cell dysfunction (e.g. hepatitis), while elevations ofdirect bilirubin typically result from obstruction eitherwithin the liver (intrahepatic) or a source outside the liver(e.g. gallstones or a tumor blocking the bile ducts). Biliru-\nbin measurements are especially valuable in newborns, asextremely elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin canaccumulate in the brain, causing irreparable damage.\nAmmonia\nAnalysis of blood ammonia aids in the diagnosis of\nsevere liver diseases and helps to monitor the course ofthese diseases. Together with the AST and the ALT,ammonia levels are used to confirm a diagnosis ofReye’s syndrome (a rare disorder usually seen in chil-\ndren and associated with aspirin intake), which is char-\nacterized by brain and liver damage following an upperrespiratory tract infection, chickenpox , or influenza .\nAmmonia levels are also helpful in the diagnosis andtreatment of hepatic encephalopathy, a serious brain con-dition caused by the accumulated toxins that result fromliver disease and liver failure.\nPreparation\nPreparation requirements for all these tests vary\nfrom laboratory to laboratory, so it is generally consid-ered best that the patient be in a fasting state (nothing to\neat or drink) after midnight the day before the test(s).\nAftercare\nBecause many patients with liver disease have pro-\nlonged clotting times, it is important to monitor the punc-ture site for bleeding after blood is drawn (venipuncture).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2025Liver function testsRisks\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\nNormal results\nReference ranges vary from laboratory to laboratory\nand also depend upon the method used. However, normalvalues can generally be found within the followingranges, unless specified differently.\n• ALT: 5-35 IU/L (values for the elderly may be slightly\nhigher, and values also may be higher in men and inAfrican-Americans)\n• AST: 0-35 IU/L\n• ALP: 30-120 IU/L\n• GGT: Normal values for this test vary widely, depend-\ning on the laboratory performing the test, and the ageand sex of the patient. For example, females less than45 years old have lower values than both males andfemales over 45 years of age. Values in the newborn canbe as much as five times higher than in adults.KEY TERMS\nCirrhosis —A serious disease of the liver caused by\nchronic damage to its cells and the eventual forma-tion of scar tissue (fibrosis). The most common symp-toms are mild jaundice, fluid collection in the tissues,mental confusion, and vomiting of blood. If leftuntreated, cirrhosis lead to liver failure and death.\nHemolytic disease of the newborn —Also known as\nerythroblastosis neonatorum, this is a condition inwhich a newborn’s red blood cells are destroyed byantibodies that have crossed the placenta from themother’s blood. (Hemolytic disease begins in thefetus, in whom the disease is called erythroblastosisfetalis). Severe anemia caused by hemolytic diseaseis treated in the same way as other anemias, butwhen jaundice appears due to increased bilirubin,the jaundice is treated by exposing the infant tobright lights. In severe cases, exchange transfusionis required or brain damage may result.\nHepatitis —An inflammation of the liver, with\naccompanying liver cell damage or cell death,caused most frequently by viral infection, but alsoby certain drugs, chemicals, or poisons. May beeither acute (of limited duration) or chronic (contin-uing). Symptoms include jaundice, nausea, vomit-\ning, loss of appetite, tenderness in the right upperabdomen, aching muscles, and joint pain. In severecases, liver failure may result.\nHepatic encephalopathy —Also called liver enceph-\nalopathy or hepatic coma, this is a disorder in whichbrain function deteriorates because toxic sub-stances, which would normally be removed by theliver, accumulate in the bloodstream due to liverdamage or disease. Early symptoms include subtlechanges in logical thinking, personality and behav-ior. As the disorder progresses, signs of drowsinessand confusion increase until eventually the patientloses consciousness and lapses into coma.\nReye’s syndrome —A rare disorder characterized by\nbrain and liver damage following an upper respira-tory tract infection, chickenpox, or influenza,almost entirely confined to children under age 15,and often related to aspirin ingestion for a viralinfection. Symptoms include uncontrollable vomit-ing, often with lethargy, memory loss, disorienta-tion, or delirium. Swelling of the brain may causeseizures, coma, and in severe cases, death.\n• Bilirubin: (Adult, elderly, and child) Total bilirubin:\n0.1-1.0 mg/dL; indirect bilirubin: 0.2-0.8 mg/dL; directbilirubin: 0.1-0.3 mg/dL. (Newborn) Total bilirubin: 1-12 mg/dL. Note: critical values for adult: greater than1.2 mg/dL. Critical values for newborn (requiringimmediate treatment): greater than 15 mg/dL.\n• Ammonia: Normal values for this test vary widely,\ndepending upon the laboratory performing the test, the ageof the patient, and the type of specimen. For example, val-ues are somewhat higher in arterial than in venous blood.\n• PT: 9-12 seconds.\nAbnormal results\nALT: Values are significantly increased in cases of\nhepatitis, and moderately increased in cirrhosis, livertumor, obstructive jaundice, and severe burns . Values are\nmildly increased in pancreatitis ,heart attack , infec-\ntious mononucleosis, and shock . Most useful when com-\npared with ALP levels.\n• AST: High levels may indicate liver cell damage,\nhepatitis, heart attack, heart failure , or gall stones.\n• ALP: Elevated levels occur in diseases that impair bile\nformation ( cholestasis ). ALP may also be elevated in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2026Liver function testsmany other liver disorders, as well as some lung cancers\n(bronchogenic carcinoma) and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.However, elevated ALP levels may also occur in other-wise healthy people, especially among older people.\nGGT: Increased levels are diagnostic of hepatitis,\ncirrhosis, liver tumor or metastasis, as well as injuryfrom drugs toxic to the liver. Although the causes areunclear, GGT levels may increase with alcohol ingestion,heart attack, pancreatitis, infectious mononucleosis, andReye’s syndrome.\nBilirubin: Increased indirect or total bilirubin levels\ncan indicate various serious anemias , including hemolyt-\nic disease of the newborn and transfusion reaction.\nIncreased direct bilirubin levels can be diagnostic of bile\nduct obstruction, gallstones, cirrhosis, or hepatitis. It isimportant to note that if total bilirubin levels in the new-born reach or exceed critical levels, exchange transfusionis necessary to avoid kernicterus, a condition that causesbrain damage.\nAmmonia: Increased levels are seen in primary liver\ncell disease, Reye’s syndrome, severe heart failure,hemolytic disease of the newborn, and hepatic enceph-alopathy.\nPT: Elevated in acute liver injury, vitamin K defi-\nciencies, and disorders with impair the absorption of vit-amin K, including cholestasis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCahill, Mathew.

    "content": "Liver nuclear medicine scan\nDefinition\nA liver scan is a diagnostic procedure to evaluate the\nliver for suspected disease. A radioactive substance thatconcentrates in the liver is injected intravenously and theimage of its distribution in the body is analyzed to diag-nose certain abnormalities.\nPurpose\nIn the past, liver scans were used to evaluate the liver\nin a wide variety of situations. It was considered a usefulstudy to detect abnormalities, but was often not able toestablish a specific diagnosis. In the 1990s, radionuclideimaging of the liver (use of a radioactive form of cobalt oriodine) evolved into a more specialized study, used toidentify individual diseases or conditions. This is accom-plished by using different radioisotopes preciselydesigned to further evaluate a particular case. Isotopes aredifferent forms of the same substance, such as radioactiveiodine, that are injected into the body. This allows thephysician to trace the process of the substance throughoutthe part of the body that is being tested for disease.\nA liver scan is usually ordered after blood studies\nand other imaging procedures have shown a liver abnor-mality. It is most often used to further evaluate masses ortumors. These may be benign growths in the liver, orcancer which has developed in the liver or has spread (or\nmetastasized) from another organ.\nA liver scan may also be helpful in diagnosing spe-\ncific disorders, by detecting features which are character-istic of a disorder, such as cirrhosis of the liver. This\nstudy may also be part of the battery of tests used to eval-uate potential candidates for liver transplant.\nPrecautions\nWomen who are pregnant or breast feeding should\nnot have this test.\nDescription\nThis test can be performed in an outpatient setting or\na hospital x-ray department. The patient usually lies downwhile a radioactive substance (radioactive isotope) whichaccumulates in the liver is injected through a vein in thearm. Scanning times may vary, depending on the specificradioisotope used. It most often begins within minutesafter injection. The radionuclide scanner, sometimescalled a gamma camera or scintillation camera, is posi-tioned above the upper abdomen and may lightly touch thepatient. It is important for the patient to lie quietly. Posi-tion changes and brief periods of breath holding may berequired. The test usually takes approximately one hour.\nA specialized liver scan used to assess blood flow is\nfrequently used. It may be referred to as a radionuclideblood pool or volume study, a labeled red cell scintigram,or some combination of these terms. Other studies maybe named for the radioisotope used. This test may also becalled a liver-spleen scan.\nPreparation\nNo physical preparation is required. A liver scan\nshould be performed before doing any study that uses\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2027Liver nuclear medicine scaniodinated or barium-containing contrast agents, to pre-\nvent inaccurate results.\nThe patients should understand that there is no dan-\nger of radioactive exposure to themselves or others. Onlysmall amounts of radionuclide are used. The totalamount of radiation absorbed is often less than the dosereceived from ordinary x rays. The scanner does not emitany radiation, but detects and records it from the patient.\nAftercare\nNo special precautions are needed.\nNormal results\nA normal scan will show a liver of normal size,\nshape, and position.\nAbnormal results\nAn abnormal liver scan may result from a mass.\nDepending on the radioisotope and technique used, thescan may identify particular types of tumors or certaincancers. Too much radioisotope in the spleen and bones,compared to the liver, can indicate potential hyperten-\nsion or cirrhosis. Liver diseases such as cirrhosis or\nhepatitis may also cause an abnormal scan, but arerarely diagnosed from the information revealed by thisstudy alone.\nResources\nBOOKS\nVitti, Richard A., and Leon S.

It\nreceives all nutrients, drugs, and toxins absorbed fromthe intestines and performs the final stages of digestion,converting food into energy and replacement parts for thebody. The liver also filters the blood of all waste prod-ucts, removes and detoxifies poisons and excretes manyof these into the bile. It processes other chemicals forexcretion by the kidneys. The liver is also an energy stor-age organ, changing food energy to a chemical calledglycogen that can be rapidly converted to fuel.\nAs the liver fails, all of its functions diminish.\nNutrition suffers, toxins build up, and waste products\naccumulate. Scar tissue builds up on the liver if disease isof long duration. As the liver scars, blood flow is pro-gressively restricted in the portal vein, which carriesblood from the stomach and abdominal organs to theliver. The resulting high blood pressure ( hypertension )\ncauses swelling of and bleeding from the blood vesselsof the esophagus. Severe jaundice , fluid accumulation in\nthe abdomen ( ascites ), and deterioration of mental func-\ntion, due to the build-up of toxins in the blood ( liver\nencephalopathy ), eventually occur, leading to death .\nAmong the many causes of liver failure that bring\npatients to transplant surgery are:\n• progressive hepatitis (mostly due to virus infection)\naccounts for more than a third\n• alcohol damage brings in about 20%\n• scarring or abnormality of the biliary system accounts\nfor roughly another 20%\n• the remainder comes from selected cancers, other\nuncommon diseases, and a situation called fulminantliver failure\nFulminant liver failure most commonly happens\nduring acute viral hepatitis, but it is also the result ofmushroom poisoning by Amanita phalloides and toxic\nreactions to some medicines, like an overdose of aceta-\nminophen . This is a special category of candidates for\nliver transplant because of the speed of their disease andthe immediate need of treatment.\nThe first human liver transplant was performed in\n1963, and since then, thousands of liver transplants aredone every year. Since the introduction of of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2028Liver transplantationcyclosporine (a drug that suppresses the immune\nresponse that rejects the donor organ), success rates forliver transplantation have reached 85%.\nPrecautions\nPatients with advanced heart and lung disease, who\nare HIV positive, and who abuse drugs and alcohol arepoor candidates for liver tranplantation. Their ability tosurvive the surgery and the difficult recovery period, aswell as their longterm prognosis, is hindered by theirconditions.\nDescription\nThere are three types of liver transplantation meth-\nods. They include:\n• Orthotopic transplantation is the replacement of a\nwhole diseased liver with a healthy donor liver.\n• Heterotopic transplantation is the addition of a donor\nliver at another site, while the diseased liver is left intact.\n• Reduced-size liver transplantation is the replacement of\na whole diseased liver with a portion of a healthy donorliver. Reduced-size liver transplants are most often per-formed on children.\nWhen an orthotopic transplantation is performed, a\nsegment of the inferior vena cava attached to the liver istaken from the donor as well. The same parts areremoved from the recipient and replaced by connectingthe inferior vena cava, the hepatic artery, the portal veinand the bile ducts.\nWhen there is a possibility that the afflicted liver\nmay recover, a heterotopic tranplantation is performed.The donor liver is placed in a different site, but it still hasto have the same connections. It is usually attached verynear the original liver, and if the original liver recovers,the donor shrivels away. If the original liver does notrecover, it will shrivel, leaving the donor in place.\nReduced-size liver transplantation tranplants part of\na donor liver into a patient. It is possible to divide theliver into eight pieces, each supplied by a different set ofblood vessels. Two of these pieces have been enough tosave a patient in liver failure, especially if the patient is achild. It is therefore possible to transplant one liver intoat least two patients and to transplant part of a liver froma living donor and have both donor and recipient survive.Liver tissue grows to accommodate its job so long asthere is initially enough of the organ to use. Patients havesurvived with only 15-20% of their original liver, provid-ed that 15-20% was healthy.\nAvailability of organs for transplant is a current crisis\nin the transplantation business. In October 1997, a nation-al distribution system was established that gives priority\nto the sickest patients closest in location to the donorliver, but makes livers available nationally. It is now pos-sible to preserve a liver out of the body for 10-20 hours byflushing it with cooled solutions of special chemicals andnutrients, so it can be transported across the country.\nPreparation\nBefore transplantation takes place, the patient is first\ndetermined to be a good candidate for transplantation bygoing through rigorous medical examination. A suitablecandidate boosts their nutritional intake in order toensure that they are as healthy as possible before surgery.Drugs are administered that will decrease rejection aftersurgery. Consultation with the patient, as well as anyfamily, is conducted to explain the surgery and its com-plications. Psychological counciling is recommended.\nAftercare\nIn order to prevent organ rejection, immunosuppres-\nsive drugs will be taken. Hospitalization ranges from fourweeks to five months, depending on the rate of recovery.\nSuccessfully receiving a transplanted liver is only the\nbeginning of a life-long process. Patients with transplant-ed livers have to stay on immunosuppressant drugs for\nthe rest of their lives to prevent organ rejection. Althoughmany can reduce the dosage after the initial few months,virtually none can discontinue drugs altogether. Pred-nisone, azathioprine, and tacrolimus are often combinedwith cyclosporine for better results. Newer immunosup-pressive agents are coming that promise even betterresults. In spite of immunosuppressants, rejection occursmost of the time and requires additional medication. Insome cases it cannot be reversed, and retransplantationbecomes necessary.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2029Liver transplantation\nThe diseased liver of a patient ready for transplantation.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)Risks\nEarly failure of the transplant occurs once in four surg-\neries and has to be repeated. Some transplants never work,some succumb to infection, and some suffer immune rejec-tion. Primary failure is apparent within one or two days.Infections happen in half the patients and often appear dur-ing the first week. Rejection usually starts at the end of thefirst week. The surgery itself may need revision because ofnarrowing, leaking, or blood clots at the connections.\nThere are potential social and economic problems,\npsychological problems, and a vast array of possible med-ical and surgical complications. Close medical surveil-lance must continue for the rest of the patient’s life. Infec-tions are a constant risk while on immunosuppressiveagents, because the immune system is supposed to preventthem. A way has not yet been devised to control rejectionwithout hampering immune defenses against infections.Not only do ordinary infections pose a threat, but becauseof the impaired immunity, transplant patients are suscepti-ble to the same “opportunistic” infections that threatenAIDS patients—pneumocystis pneumonia , herpes and\ncytomegalovirus infections, fungi, and a host of bacteria.\nImmunosuppression also hinders the body’s ability\nto resist cancer . All the drugs used to prevent rejection\nincrease the risk of leukemias and lymphomas.\nThere is also a risk of the original disease returning.\nHepatitis virus still inhabits the patient, as does the urgeto drink alcohol. Newer antiviral drugs hold out\npromise for dealing with hepatitis, and AlcoholicsAnonymous (AA) is the most effective treatment knownfor alcoholism .\nDrug reactions are also a continuing threat. Every drug\nused to suppress the immune system has potential problems.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDienstag, Jules. “Liver Transplantation.” In Harrison’s Princi-\nples of Internal Medicine , ed. Anthony S.

    "content": "Low back pain\nDefinition\nLow back pain is a common musculoskeletal symp-\ntom that may be either acute or chronic. It may be causedby a variety of diseases and disorders that affect the lumbarspine. Low back pain is often accompanied by sciatica ,\nwhich is pain that involves the sciatic nerve and is felt inthe lower back, the buttocks, and the backs of the thighs.\nDescription\nLow back pain is a symptom that affects 80% of the\ngeneral United States population at some point in lifewith sufficient severity to cause absence from work. It isthe second most common reason for visits to primarycare doctors, and is estimated to cost the American econ-omy $75 billion every year.\nLow back pain may be experienced in several differ-\nent ways:\n• Localized. In localized pain the patient will feel sore-\nness or discomfort when the doctor palpates, or presseson, a specific surface area of the lower back.\n• Diffuse. Diffuse pain is spread over a larger area and\ncomes from deep tissue layers.\n• Radicular. The pain is caused by irritation of a nerve\nroot. Sciatica is an example of radicular pain.• Referred. The pain is perceived in the lower back but is\ncaused by inflammation elsewhere—often in the kid-neys or lower abdomen.\nCauses and Symptoms\nAcute pain\nAcute pain in the lower back that does not extend to\nthe leg is most commonly caused by a sprain or muscletear, usually occurring within 24 hours of heavy lifting oroveruse of the back muscles. The pain is usually local-ized, and there may be muscle spasms or soreness whenthe doctor touches the area. The patient usually feels bet-ter when resting.\nChronic pain\nChronic low back pain has several different possible\ncauses:\nMECHANICAL. Chronic strain on the muscles of the\nlower back may be caused by obesity ; pregnancy ; or\njob-related stooping, bending, or other stressful postures.\nMALIGNANCY. Low back pain at night that is not\nrelieved by lying down may be caused by a tumor in thecauda equina (the roots of the spinal nerves controllingsensation in and movement of the legs), or a cancer that\nhas spread to the spine from the prostate, breasts, orlungs. The risk factors for the spread of cancer to thelower back include a history of smoking , sudden weight\nloss, and age over 50.\nANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. Ankylosing spondyli-\ntisis a form of arthritis that causes chronic pain in the\nlower back. The pain is made worse by sitting or lyingdown and improves when the patient gets up. It is mostcommonly seen in males between 16 and 35. Ankylosingspondylitis is often confused with mechanical back painin its early stages.\nHERNIATED SPINAL DISK. Disk herniation is a disor-\nder in which a spinal disk begins to bulge outwardbetween the vertebrae. Herniated or ruptured disks are acommon cause of chronic low back pain in adults.\nPSYCHOGENIC. Back pain that is out of proportion\nto a minor injury, or that is unusually prolonged, may beassociated with a somatoform disorder or other psychi-atric disturbance.\nLow back pain with leg involvement\nLow back pain that radiates down the leg usually\nindicates involvement of the sciatic nerve. The nerve canbe pinched or irritated by herniated disks, tumors of thecauda equina, abscesses in the space between the spinal\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2031Low back paincord and its covering, spinal stenosis , and compression\nfractures . Some patients experience numbness or weak-\nness of the legs as well as pain.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of low back pain can be complicated.\nMost cases are initially evaluated by primary care physi-cians rather than by specialists.\nInitial workup\nPATIENT HISTORY. The doctor will ask the patient\nspecific questions about the location of the pain, its char-acteristics, its onset, and the body positions or activitiesthat make it better or worse. If the doctor suspects thatthe pain is referred from other organs, he or she will askabout a history of diabetes, peptic ulcers, kidney stones ,\nurinary tract infections, or heart murmurs .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION. The doctor will examine\nthe patient’s back and hips to check for conditions thatrequire surgery or emergency treatment. The examinationincludes several tests that involve moving the patient’slegs in specific positions to test for nerve root irritation ordisk herniation. The flexibility of the lumbar vertebraemay be measured to rule out ankylosing spondylitis.\nImaging studies\nImaging studies are not usually performed on\npatients whose history and physical examination sug-\ngest routine muscle strain or overuse. X rays are orderedfor patients whose symptoms suggest cancer, infection,inflammation, pelvic or abdominal disease, or bone frac-tures. MRIs are usually ordered only for patients withcertain types of masses or tumors.\nIt is important to know that the appearance of some\nabnormalities on imaging studies of the lower back doesnot necessarily indicate that they cause the pain. Manypatients have minor deformities that do not create symp-toms. The doctor must compare the results of imagingstudies very carefully with information from the patient’shistory and physical examination.\nTreatment\nAll forms of treatment of low back pain are aimed\neither at symptom relief or to prevent interference withthe processes of healing. None of these methods appearto speed up healing.\nAcute pain\nAcute back pain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen,\nmuscle relaxants , or aspirin . Applications of heat or\ncold compresses are also helpful to most patients. If thepatient has not experienced some improvement after sev-eral weeks of treatment, the doctor will reinvestigate thecause of the pain.\nChronic pain\nPatients with chronic back pain are treated witha com-\nbination of medications, physical therapy, andoccupationalor lifestyle modification. The medicationsgiven are usuallyNSAIDs, although patients withhypertension, kidney prob-lems, or stomach ulcers should not take these drugs.Patients who take NSAIDs for longer than six weeksshould be monitored periodically for complications.\nPhysical therapy for chronic low back pain usually\nincludes regular exercise for fitness and flexibility, and\nmassage or application of heat if necessary.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2032Low back pain\n/K42/K41\n/K43\n/K45/K44\nSites of low back pain. Pain anywhere along the spine (A)\ncan be caused by osteoarthritis. Pain along one or the otherside of the spine may be (B) a kidney infection.Trauma toback muscles, joints, or disks (C) causes low back pain.Damage to the coccyx (D) can occur during a fall. Sciatica(E) can cause pain to run down from the back and buttocksarea down a leg. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)Lifestyle modifications include giving up smoking,\nweight reduction (if necessary), and evaluation of thepatient’s occupation or other customary activities.\nPatients with herniated disks are treated surgically if\nthe pain does not respond to medication.\nPatients with chronic low back pain sometimes ben-\nefit from pain management techniques, including\nbiofeedback ,acupuncture , and chiropractic manipula-\ntion of the spine.\nPsychotherapy is recommended for patients whose\nback pain is associated with a somatoform, anxiety ,o r\ndepressive disorder.\nLow back pain with leg involvement\nTreatment of sciatica and other disorders that\ninvolve the legs may include NSAIDs. Patients withlong-standing sciatica or spinal stenosis that do notrespond to NSAIDs are treated surgically. Althoughsome doctors use cortisone injections to relieve the pain,this form of treatment is still debated.\nAlternative treatment\nA thorough differential diagnosis is important before\nany treatment is considered. There are times when alter-native therapies are the most beneficial, and other timeswhen more invasive treatments are needed.\nChiropractic\nChiropractic treats patients by manipulating or\nadjusting sections of the spine. It is one of the most pop-ular forms of alternative treatment in the United Statesfor relief of back pain caused by straining or liftinginjuries. Some osteopathic physicians, physical thera-pists, and naturopathic physicians also use spinal manip-ulation to treat patients with low back pain.\nTraditional Chinese medicine\nPractitioners of traditional Chinese medicine treat\nlow back pain with acupuncture, tui na (push-and-rub)\nmassage, and the application of herbal poultices.\nHerbal medicine\nHerbal medicine can utilize a variety of antispasmodic\nherbs in combination to help relieve low back pain due tospasm.

    "title": "Lower esophageal ring",
    "content": "Lower esophageal ring\nDefinition\nLower esophageal ring is a condition in which there is\na ring of tissue inside the lower part of the esophagus (thetube connecting the throat with the stomach). This tissuecauses narrowing and partial blockage of the esophagus.Lower esophageal ring can also refer to the ring itself.\nDescription\nLower esophageal ring (also called Schatzki’s ring\nand B-ring) affects about 10-14% of the population.Normally, the lower part of the esophagus, near wherethe esophagus meets the stomach, has an inside diameterof 1.5-2 inches (3.8-5 cm). The diameter of this part ofthe esophagus is less when lower esophageal ring is pre-sent, and diameters as small as one-eighth inch (0.3 cm)have been seen. When the inside diameter is less thanabout three-fourths of an inch, intermittent difficultywith swallowing can result. About 96% of people withlower esophageal ring have no symptoms.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nLower esophageal ring seems to result from\ninfoldings of tissue near the bottom of the esophagus,but the underlying cause is unknown. Although somespecialists speculate they are due to a congenitaldefect, most people do not develop symptoms untilthey reach their forties or later. Although loweresophageal ring is generally associated with hiatal her-\nnia, and sometimes with heartburn , the cause/effect\nrelationship is unclear.\nSymptoms\nIntermittent difficulty swallowing solid food is the\nprimary symptom of this condition. The degree of diffi-culty in swallowing is directly related to the degree theesophagus is narrowed. Certain foods, especially toughor fibrous foods like meat, are more likely to cause swal-lowing difficulties.\nDiagnosis\nGastroenterologists and internists are best\nequipped to diagnose and treat lower esophageal ring.The diagnosis is based on the patient’s history of swal-lowing difficulties and a barium x ray of the upper gas-trointestinal tract. For a barium x ray, the patient swal-lows a liquid containing barium, a substance that isopaque to x rays. Subsequent x-ray photographyreveals the shape of the esophagus and any narrowregions present.\nThe presence of a lower esophageal ring can also be\nshown with a test called an esophagoscopy. This proce-dure visualizes the inside of the esophagus with an insert-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2034Lower esophageal ringed, thin, flexible tube. However, this test is less sensitive\nfor lower esophageal ring and costs about five times asmuch as barium x ray. However, if the findings of a bari-um x ray are not definitive, esophagoscopy should bedone. Biopsies can then be done on questionable areas.\nTreatment\nDietary change\nSwallowing difficulties due to lower esophageal ring\ncan often be relieved by chewing food more thoroughly.Soft foods and liquids may also be recommended.\nDilation\nLower esophageal rings can be corrected by passing\na bougie (a cylindrical, mercury-filled dilator) throughthe esophagus. This procedure, called bougienage, iseffective most of the time, but may need to be repeatedevery few years. Complications and adverse reactions areextremely rare.\nSurgery\nIf bougienage is unsuccessful, lower esophageal ring\ntissue can be surgically removed.\nPrognosis\nThe probability of a favorable outcome is high.\nSwallowing difficulties can be alleviated in almost everycase, and the rate of complications from bougienage orsurgery is less than 1%.\nPrevention\nSince the cause of lower esophageal ring is not\nknown, there are no definitive preventive measures. Nev-ertheless, anyone with lower esophageal ring who alsosuffers from heartburn would be wise to prevent or treatthe heartburn. It is possible that the stomach acid in theesophagus associated with heartburn contributes toesophageal ring.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCastell, Donald O., ed. The Esophagus. 2nd ed.

    "title": "Lumpectomy",
    "content": "Lumpectomy\nDefinition\nA lumpectomy is a type of surgery for breast can-\ncer. It is considered “breast-conserving” surgery because\nin a lumpectomy, only the malignant tumor and a sur-rounding margin of normal breast tissue are removed.Lymph nodes in the armpit (axilla) may also be removed.This procedure is called lymph node dissection.\nPurpose\nLumpectomy is a surgical treatment for newly diag-\nnosed breast cancer . It is estimated that at least 50% of\nwomen with breast cancer are good candidates for thisprocedure. The location, size, and type of tumor are ofprimary importance when considering breast cancersurgery options. The size of the breast is another factorthe surgeon considers when recommending surgery. Thepatient’s psychological outlook, as well as her lifestyleand preferences, should also be taken into account whentreatment decisions are made.\nThe extent and severity of a cancer is evaluated or\n“staged” according to a fairly complex system. Stagingconsiders the size of the tumor and whether the cancerhas spread directly to adjacent tissues, such as the chestwall, the lymph nodes, and/or to distant parts of thebody. Women with early stage breast cancers are usuallybetter candidates for lumpectomy. In most cases, acourse of radiation therapy after surgery is part of the\ntreatment. Chemotherapy or hormone treatment may\nalso be prescribed.\nMany studies have compared the survival rates of\nwomen who have had removal of a breast ( mastectomy )\nwith those who have undergone lumpectomy and radia-tion therapy. The data clearly demonstrate that forwomen with comparable stages of breast cancer, survivalrates are equal between the two groups.\nIn some instances, women with later stage breast\ncancer may be able to have lumpectomy. Chemotherapymay be administered before surgery to decrease tumorsize and the chance of spread in selected cases.\nPrecautions\nThere are a number of factors that may prevent or\nprohibit a breast cancer patient from having a lumpecto-my. The tumor itself may be too large or located in anarea where it would be difficult to remove with good cos-metic results. Sometimes several areas of cancer arefound in one breast, so the tumor cannot be removed as asingle lump. A cancer that has already attached itself tonearby structures, such as the skin or the chest wall,needs more extensive surgery.\nCertain medical or physical circumstances may also\neliminate lumpectomy as a treatment option. Sometimeslumpectomy may be attempted, but the surgeon is unableto remove the tumor with a sufficient amount of normaltissue surrounding it. This may be termed “persistentlypositive margins,” or “lack of clear margins,” referring tothe margin of unaffected tissue around the tumor. Lumpec-tomy is not used for women who have had a previouslumpectomy and have a recurrence of the breast cancer.\nBecause of the need for radiation therapy after\nlumpectomy, this surgery may be medically unaccept-able. A breast cancer discovered during pregnancy is not\namenable to lumpectomy, due to the need for radiationtherapy as part of the treatment. Radiation therapy cannotbe administered to pregnant women because it mayinjure the fetus. If, however, delivery would be complet-ed prior to the need for radiation, pregnant women mayundergo lumpectomy. Women with collagen vasculardisease, such as lupus erythematosus or scleroderma ,\nwould experience scarring and damage to their connec-tive tissue if exposed to radiation treatments. A womanwho has already had therapeutic radiation to the chestarea for other reasons cannot have additional exposurefor breast cancer therapy.\nSome women may choose not to have a lumpectomy\nfor other reasons. They may strongly fear a recurrence ofbreast cancer, and may consider a lumpectomy too risky.Others feel uncomfortable with a breast that has had acancer, and they experience more peace of mind with theentire breast removed.\nThe need for radiation therapy may also be a barrier\ndue to non-medical concerns. Some women simply fearthis type of treatment and choose more extensive surgeryso that radiation will not be required. The commitment oftime, usually five days a week for six weeks, may not beacceptable for others. This may be due to financial, per-sonal, or job-related constraints. Finally, in geographical-ly isolated areas, a course of radiation therapy mayrequire lengthy travel, and perhaps unacceptable amountsof time away from family and other responsibilities.\nDescription\nLumpectomy is an imprecise term. Any amount of\ntissue, from 1% to 50% of the breast, may be removed\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2036Lumpectomyand called a lumpectomy. Other names are no more defi-\nnite in their meaning, although some idea of the scope oftissue removal may be implied. Breast conservationsurgery is a frequently-used synonym for lumpectomy.Partial mastectomy, quadrantectomy, segmental excision,wide excision, and tylectomy are other, less commonlyused names for this procedure.\nA lumpectomy is frequently done in a hospital set-\nting (especially if lymph nodes are to be removed at thesame time), but specialized outpatient facilities are some-times preferred. The surgery is usually done while thepatient is under general anesthetic. Local anesthetic withadditional sedation may be used for some patients. The\ntumor and surrounding margin of tissue is removed andsent to the pathologist. The surgical site is closed.\nIf axillary lymph nodes were not removed before, a\nsecond incision is made in the armpit. The fat pad thatcontains lymph nodes is removed from this area and isalso sent to the pathologist for analysis. This portion ofthe procedure is called an axillary lymph node dissec-tion; it is critical for determining the stage of the cancer.Typically, 10 to 15 nodes are removed, but the numbermay vary. Surgical drains may be left in place in eitherlocation to prevent fluid accumulation. The surgery maylast from one to three hours.\nThe patient may stay in the hospital one or two days,\nor return home the same day. This generally depends onthe extent of the surgery, the medical condition of thepatient, and physician and patient preferences. A womanusually goes home with a small bandage. The inner partof the surgical site usually has dissolvable stitches. Theskin may be sutured or stitched; or the skin edges may beheld together with steristrips, which are special thin,clear pieces of tape.\nPreparation\nRoutine preoperative preparations, such as having\nnothing to eat or drink the night before surgery, are typi-cally ordered for a lumpectomy. Information aboutexpected outcomes and potential complications is alsopart of preparation for lumpectomy, as it is for any surgi-cal procedure. It is especially important that womenknow about sensations they might experience after theoperation, so the sensations are not misinterpreted assigns of further cancer or poor healing.\nIf the tumor is not able to be felt (not palpable), a\npre-operative localization procedure is needed. A finewire, or other device, is placed at the tumor site, using xray or ultrasound for guidance. This is usually done inthe radiology department of a hospital. The woman ismost often sitting up and awake, although some sedationmay be administered.Aftercare\nAfter a lumpectomy, patients are usually cautioned\nagainst lifting anything which weighs over five poundsfor several days. Other activities may be restricted (espe-cially if the axillary lymph nodes were removed) accord-ing to individual needs. Pain is often enough to limit\ninappropriate motion. Women are often instructed towear a well-fitting support bra both day and night forapproximately one week after surgery.\nPain is usually well controlled with prescribed med-\nication. If it is not, the patient should contact the surgeon,as severe pain may be a sign of a complication, whichneeds medical attention. A return visit to the surgeon isnormally scheduled approximately ten days to two weeksafter the operation.\nRadiation therapy is usually started as soon as feasible\nafter lumpectomy. Other additional treatments, such aschemotherapy or hormone therapy, may also be prescribed.The timing of these is specific to each individual patient.\nRisks\nThe risks are similar to those associated with any\nsurgical procedure. Risks include bleeding, infection,asymmetry, anesthesia reaction, or unexpected scarring.A lumpectomy may also cause loss of sensation in thebreast. The size and shape of the breast will be affectedby the operation. Fluid can accumulate in the area wheretissue was removed, requiring drainage.\nIf lymph node dissection is performed, there are sev-\neral potential complications. A woman may experiencedecreased feeling in the back of her armpit. She may alsoexperience other sensations, including numbness, tin-gling, or increased skin sensitivity. An inflammation ofthe arm vein, called phlebitis, can occur. There may beinjury to the nerves controlling arm motion.\nApproximately 2% to 10% of patients develop lym-\nphedema (swelling of the arm) after axillary lymph node\ndissection. This swelling of the arm can range from mildto very severe. It can be treated with elastic bandages andspecialized physical therapy, but it is a chronic condition,requiring continuing care. Lymphedema can arise at anytime, even years after surgery.\nA new technique that may eliminate the need for\nremoving many axillary lymph nodes is being tested.Sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy is based on theidea that the condition of the first lymph node in the net-work, which drains the affected area, can predict whetherthe cancer may have spread to the rest of the nodes. It isthought that if this first, or sentinel, node is cancer-free,then there is no need to look further. Many patients withearly-stage breast cancers may be spared the risks and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2037Lumpectomycomplications of axillary lymph node dissection as the\nuse of this approach continues to increase.\nNormal results\nWhen lumpectomy is performed, it is anticipated\nthat it will be the definitive surgical treatment for breastcancer. Other forms of therapy, especially radiation, areoften prescribed as part of the total treatment plan. Theexpected outcome is no recurrence of the breast cancer.\nAbnormal results\nAn unforeseen outcome of lumpectomy may be\nrecurrence of the breast cancer, either locally or distally(in a part of the body far from the original site). Recur-rence may be discovered soon after lumpectomy or yearsafter the procedure. For this reason, it is important forpatients to be regularly and closely monitored by theirphysicians.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLove, Susan M., with Karen Lindsey. Dr. Susan Love’s Breast\nBook, 2nd ed.

    "title": "Lung abscess",
    "content": "Lung abscess\nDefinition\nLung abscess is an acute or chronic infection of the\nlung, marked by a localized collection of pus, inflamma-tion, and destruction of tissue.\nDescription\nLung abscess is the end result of a number of differ-\nent disease processes ranging from fungal and bacterialinfections to cancer . It can affect anyone at any age.\nPatients who are most vulnerable include those weakenedby cancer and other chronic diseases; patients with a his-tory of substance abuse, diabetes, epilepsy, or poor dentalhygiene; patients who have recently had operations underanesthesia; and stroke patients. In children, the most vul-\nnerable patients are those with weakened immune sys-tems, malnutrition , or blunt injuries to the chest.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe immediate cause of most lung abscesses is\ninfection caused by bacteria. About 65% of these infec-tions are produced by anaerobes, which are bacteria thatdo not need air or oxygen to live. The remaining casesare caused by a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic (airbreathing) bacteria. When the bacteria arrive in the lung,they are engulfed or eaten by special cells called phago-cytes. The phagocytes release chemicals that contributeto inflammation and eventual necrosis, or death , of a\npart of the lung tissue. There are several different waysthat bacteria can get into the lung.\nAspiration\nAspiration refers to the accidental inhalation of\nmaterial from the mouth or throat into the airway andlungs. It is responsible for about 50% of cases of lungabscess. The human mouth and gums contain large num-bers of anaerobic bacteria; patients with periodontal dis-\nease or poor oral hygiene have higher concentrations of\nthese organisms. Aspiration is most likely to occur inpatients who are unconscious or semi-conscious due toanesthesia, seizures, alcohol and drug abuse, or stroke.Patients who have problems swallowing or coughing, or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2038Lung abscesswho have nasogastric tubes in place are also at risk of\naspiration.\nBronchial obstruction\nThe bronchi are the two branches of the windpipe\nthat lead into the lungs. If they are blocked by tissueswelling, cancerous tumors, or foreign objects , a lung\nabscess may form from infection trapped behind theblockage.\nSpread of infection\nAbout 20% of cases of pneumonia that cause the\ndeath of lung tissue (necrotizing pneumonia) will devel-op into lung abscess. Lung abscess can also be caused bythe spread of other infections from the liver, abdominalcavity, or open chest wounds . Rarely, AIDS patients can\ndevelop lung abscess from Pneumocystis carinii and\nother organisms that take advantage of a weakenedimmune system.\nLung abscess is usually slow to develop. It may take\nabout two weeks after aspiration or bronchial obstructionfor an abscess to produce noticeable symptoms. Thepatient may be acutely ill for two weeks to three months.In the beginning, the symptoms of lung abscess are diffi-cult to distinguish from those of severe pneumonia.Adults will usually have moderate fever (101-102°F/38-\n39°C), chills, chest pain , and general weakness. Chil-\ndren may or may not have chest pain, but usually sufferweight loss and high fevers. As the illness progresses,about 75% of patients will cough up foul or musty-\nsmelling sputum; some also cough up blood.\nLung abscess can lead to serious complications,\nincluding emphysema , spread of the abscess to other\nparts of the lung, hemorrhage, adult respiratory dis-\ntress syndrome , rupture of the abscess, inflammation of\nthe membrane surrounding the heart, or chronic inflam-mation of the lung.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is made on the basis of the patient’s\nmedical history (especially recent operations under gener-al anesthesia) and general health as well as imaging stud-ies. Smears and cultures taken from the patient’s sputumare not usually very helpful because they will be contami-nated with bacteria from the mouth. The doctor will firstuse a bronchoscope (lighted tube inserted into the wind-pipe) to rule out the possibility of lung cancer. In somecases of serious infection, the doctor can use a fiberopticbronchoscope with a protected specimen brush to takematerial directly from the patient’s lungs, for identifica-tion of the organism. This technique is time- consumingand expensive, and requires the patient to be taken off\nantibiotics for 48 hours. It is usually used only to evalu-\nate severely ill patients with weakened immune systems.\nIn most cases, the doctor will use the results of a\nchest x ray to help distinguish lung abscess from\nempyema , cancer, tuberculosis , or cysts. In patients\nwith lung abscess, the x ray will show a thick-walled uni-fied clear space or cavity surrounded by solid tissue.There is often a visible air-fluid level. The doctor mayalso order a CT scan of the chest, in order to have a clear-er picture of the exact location of the abscess.\nBlood tests cannot be used to make a diagnosis of\nlung abscess, but they can be useful in ruling out otherconditions. Patients with lung abscess usually haveabnormally high white blood cell counts ( leukocytosis )\nwhen their blood is tested, but this condition is notunique to lung abscess.\nTreatment\nLung abscess is treated with a combination of antibi-\notic drugs, oxygen therapy, and surgery. The antibioticsthat are usually given for lung abscess are penicillin G,penicillin V , and clindamycin. They are given intra-venously until the patient shows signs of improvement,and then continued in oral form. The patient may need totake antibiotics for a month or longer, until the chest xray indicates that the abscess is healing. Oxygen may begiven to patients who are having trouble breathing.\nSurgical treatment\nMost patients with lung abscess will not need surgery.\nAbout 5% of patients—usually those who do not respondto antibiotics or are coughing up large amounts of blood(500 mL or more)—may have emergency surgery forremoval of the diseased part of the lung or for insertion ofa tube to drain the abscess. Antibiotic treatment is consid-ered to have failed if fever and other symptoms continueafter 10-14 days of treatment; if chest x rays indicate thatthe abscess is not shrinking; or if the patient has pneumo-nia that is spreading to other parts of the lung.\nSupportive care\nBecause lung abscess is a serious condition, patients\nneed quiet and bed rest. Hospital care usually includesincreasing the patient’s fluid intake to loosen up thesecretions in the lungs, and physical therapy to strength-en the patient’s breathing muscles.\nFollow-up\nPatients with lung abscess need careful follow-up care\nafter the acute infection subsides. Follow-up usually\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2039Lung abscessincludes a series of chest x rays to make sure that the\ninfection has cleared up. Treatment with antibiotics maycontinue for as long as four months, to prevent recurrence.\nPrognosis\nAbout 95% of lung abscess patients can be treated\nsuccessfully with antibiotics alone. Patients who needsurgical treatment have a mortality rate of 10-15%.\nPrevention\nSome of the conditions that make people more vul-\nnerable to lung abscess concern long-term lifestylebehaviors, such as substance abuse and lack of dentalcare. Others, however, are connected with chronic illnessand hospitalization.

    "title": "Lung biopsy",
    "content": "Lung biopsy\nDefinition\nLung biopsy is a medical procedure performed to\nobtain a small piece of lung tissue for examination undera microscope. Biopsy examinations are usually per-formed by pathologists, who are doctors with specialtraining in tissue abnormalities and other signs of disease.\nPurpose\nLung biopsies are useful, first of all, in confirming a\ndiagnosis of cancer , especially if malignant cells are\ndetected in the patient’s sputum. A lung biopsy may beordered to examine other abnormalities that appear onchest x rays, such as lumps (nodules). It is also helpful indiagnosing symptoms such as coughing up bloody spu-tum, wheezing in the chest, or difficult breathing. In\naddition to evaluating lung tumors and their associatedsymptoms, lung biopsies can be used in the diagnosis oflung infections, especially tuberculosis , drug reactions,\nand such chronic diseases of the lung as sarcoidosis .\nA lung biopsy can be used for treatment as well as\ndiagnosis. Bronchoscopy , which is a type of lung biopsy\nperformed with a long slender instrument called a bron-choscope, can be used to clear a patient’s air passages ofsecretions and to remove blockages from the airways.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2040Lung biopsyPrecautions\nAs with any other biopsy, lung biopsies should not\nbe performed on patients who have problems with bloodclotting because of low platelet counts. Platelets aresmall blood cells that play a role in the blood clottingprocess. If the patient has a platelet count lower than\n50,000/cubic mm, he or she can be given a platelettransfusion as a temporary relief measure, and a biopsy\ncan then be performed.\nDescription\nOverview\nThe lungs are a pair of cone-shaped organs that lie in\nthe chest cavity. An area known as the mediastinum sepa-rates the right and the left lungs from each other. Theheart, the windpipe (trachea), the lymph nodes, and thetube that brings the food to the stomach (the esophagus)lie in this mediastinal cavity. Lung biopsies may involveentering the mediastinum, as well as the lungs themselves.\nTypes of lung biopsies\nLung biopsies can be performed using a variety of\ntechniques. A bronchoscopy is ordered if a patch thatlooks suspicious on the x ray seems to be located deep inthe chest. If the area lies close to the chest wall, a needlebiopsy is often done. If both these methods fail to diag-nose the problem, an open surgical biopsy may be car-ried out. If there are indications that the lung cancer hasspread to the lymph nodes in the mediastinum, a medi-\nastinoscopy is performed.\nNEEDLE BIOPSY. When a needle biopsy is to be\ndone, the patient will be given a sedative about an hourbefore the procedure, to help relaxation. The patient sitsin a chair with arms folded on a table in front of him orher. X rays are then taken to identify the location of thesuspicious areas. Small metal markers are placed on theoverlying skin to mark the biopsy site. The skin is thor-oughly cleansed with an antiseptic solution, and a localanesthetic is injected to numb the area.\nThe doctor then makes a small cut (incision) about\nhalf an inch in length. The patient is asked to take a deepbreath and hold it while the doctor inserts the specialbiopsy needle through the incision into the lung. Whenenough tissue has been obtained, the needle is with-drawn. Pressure is applied at the biopsy site and a sterilebandage is placed over the cut. The entire proceduretakes between 30 and 45 minutes.\nThe patient may feel a brief sharp pain or some\npressure as the biopsy needle is inserted. Most patients,however, do not experience severe pain.OPEN BIOPSY. Open biopsies are performed in a\nhospital under general anesthesia. As with needle biop-sies, patients are given sedatives before the procedure.An intravenous line is placed in the arm to give medica-tions or fluids as necessary. A hollow tube, called anendotracheal tube, is passed through the throat, into theairway leading to the lungs. It is used to convey the gen-eral anesthetic.\nOnce the patient is under the influence of the anes-\nthesia, the surgeon makes an incision over the lung area.Some lung tissue is removed and the cut closed withstitches. The entire procedure usually takes about anhour. A chest tube is sometimes placed with one endinside the lung and the other end protruding through theclosed incision. Chest tube placement is done to preventthe lungs from collapsing by removing the air from thelungs. The tube is removed a few days after the biopsy.\nA chest x ray is done following an open biopsy, to\ncheck for lung collapse. The patient may experiencesome grogginess for a few hours after the procedure. Heor she may also experience tiredness and muscle achesfor a day or two, because of the general anesthesia. Thethroat may be sore because of the placement of the hol-low endotracheal tube. The patient may also have somepain or discomfort at the incision site, which can berelieved by medication.\nMEDIASTINOSCOPY. The preparation for a medi-\nastinoscopy is similar to that for an open biopsy. Thepatient is sedated and prepared for general anesthesia.The neck and the chest will be cleansed with an antisep-tic solution.\nAfter the patient has been put to sleep, an incision\nabout two or three inches (5 or 8 cm) long is made at thebase of the neck. A thin, hollow, lighted tube, called amediastinoscope, is inserted through the cut into thespace between the right and the left lungs. The doctorexamines the space thoroughly and removes any lymphnodes or tissues that look abnormal. The medi-astinoscope is then removed, and the incision stitched upand bandaged. A mediastinoscopy takes about an hour.\nPreparation\nBefore scheduling any lung biopsy, the doctor will\ncheck to see if the patient is taking any prescription med-ications, if he or she has any medication allergies , and if\nthere is a history of bleeding problems. Blood tests maybe performed before the procedure to check for clottingproblems and blood type, in case a transfusion becomesnecessary.\nIf an open biopsy or a mediastinoscopy is being per-\nformed, the patient will be asked to sign a consent form.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2041Lung biopsySince these procedures are done under general anesthe-\nsia, the patient will be asked to refrain from eating ordrinking anything for at least 12 hours before the biopsy.\nAftercare\nNeedle biopsy\nFollowing a needle biopsy, the patient is allowed to\nrest comfortably. He or she will be checked by a nurse attwo-hour intervals. If there are no complications afterfour hours, the patient can go home. Patients are advisedto rest at home for a day or two before resuming regularactivities, and to avoid strenuous activities for a weekafter the biopsy.\nOpen biopsy or mediastinoscopy\nAfter an open biopsy or a mediastinoscopy, patients\nare taken to a recovery room for observation. If no othercomplications develop, they are taken back to the hospitalroom. Stitches are usually removed after seven to 14 days.\nIf the patient has extreme pain, light-headedness,\ndifficulty breathing, or develops a blue tinge to the skinafter an open biopsy, the doctor should be notified imme-diately. The sputum may be slightly bloody for a day ortwo after the procedure. If, however, the bleeding isheavy or persistent, it should be brought to the attentionof the doctor.\nRisks\nNeedle biopsy\nNeedle biopsy is a less risky procedure than an open\nbiopsy, because it does not involve general anesthesia.Very rarely, the lung may collapse because of air thatleaks in through the hole made by the biopsy needle. Ifthe lung collapses, a tube will have to be inserted into thechest to remove the air. Some coughing up of bloodoccurs in 5% of needle biopsies. Prolonged bleeding orinfection may also occur, although these are very rare.\nOpen biopsy\nPossible complications of an open biopsy include\ninfection or lung collapse. Death occurs in about one in\n3,000 cases. If the patient has very severe breathing prob-lems before the biopsy, breathing may be slightlyimpaired following the operation. If the person’s lungswere functioning normally before the biopsy, the chancesof any respiratory problems are very small.\nMediastinoscopy\nComplications due to mediastinoscopy are rare;\ndeath occurs in fewer than one in 3,000 cases. MoreKEY TERMS\nBronchoscopy —A medical test that enables the\ndoctor to see the breathing passages and the lungsthrough a hollow, lighted tube.\nEndotracheal tube —A hollow tube that is inserted\ninto the windpipe to administer anesthesia.\nLymph nodes —Small, bean-shaped structures\nscattered along the lymphatic vessels which serveas filters. Lymph nodes retain any bacteria or can-cer cells that are traveling through the system.\nMediastinoscopy —A medical procedure that\nallows the doctor to see the organs in the medi-astinal space using a thin, lighted, hollow tube (amediastinoscope).\nMediastinum —The area between the lungs, bound-\ned by the spine, breastbone, and diaphragm.\nSputum —Mucus or phlegm that is coughed up from\nthe passageways (bronchial tubes) in the lungs.\ncommon complications include lung collapse or bleeding\ncaused by damage to the blood vessels near the heart.Injury to the esophagus or voice box (larynx) may some-times occur. If the nerves leading to the larynx areinjured, the patient may be left with a permanentlyhoarse voice. All of these complications are very rare.\nNormal results\nNormal results of a needle biopsy and an open biop-\nsy include the absence of any evidence of infection in thelungs. No lumps or nodules will be detected in the lungsand the cells will not show any cancerous abnormalities.Normal results from the mediastinoscopy will show thelymph nodes to be free of cancer.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal results may be associated with diseases\nother than cancer. Nodules in the lungs may be due toactive infections such as tuberculosis, or may be scarsfrom a previous infection. The lung cells on microscopicexamination do not resemble normal cells, and show cer-tain abnormalities that point to cancer. In a third of biop-sies using a mediastinoscope, the lymph nodes that arebiopsied prove to be cancerous. Abnormal results shouldalways be considered in the context of the patient’s med-ical history, physical examination , and other tests such\nas sputum examination, chest x rays, etc. before a finaldiagnosis is made.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2042Lung biopsyResources\nBOOKS\n“Bronchoscopy.” In The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Ther-\napy. 16th ed.

    "title": "Lung cancer, non-small cell",
    "content": "Lung cancer, non-small cell\nDefinition\nNon-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which the\ncells of the lung tissues grow uncontrollably and formtumors.\nDescription\nThere are two kinds of lung cancers, primary and\nsecondary. Primary lung cancer starts in the lung itself,and is divided into small cell lung cancer and non-smallcell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancers are shaped likean oat and called oat-cell cancers; they are aggressive,spread rapidly, and represent 20% of lung cancers. Non-small cell lung cancer represents almost 80% of all pri-mary lung cancers. Secondary lung cancer is cancer thatstarts somewhere else in the body (for example, thebreast or colon) and spreads to the lungs.\nThe lungs\nThe lungs are located along with the heart in the\nchest cavity. The lungs are not simply hollow balloonsbut have a very organized structure consisting of hollowtubes, blood vessels and elastic tissue. The hollow tubes,called bronchi, are highly branched, becoming smallerand more numerous at each branching. They end in tiny,blind sacs made of elastic tissue called alveoli. Thesesacs are where the oxygen a person breathes in is takenup into the blood, and where carbon dioxide moves outof the blood to be breathed out.Normal, healthy lungs are continually secreting mucus\nthat not only keeps the lungs moist, but also protects thelungs by trapping foreign particles like dust and dirt inbreathed air. The inside of the lungs is covered with smallhairlike structures called cilia. The cilia move in such a waythat mucus is swept up out of the lungs and into the throat.\nLung cancer\nMost lung cancers start in the cells that line the\nbronchi, and can take years to develop. As they growlarger they prevent the lungs from functioning normally.The tumor can reduce the capacity of the lungs, or blockthe movement of air through the bronchi in the lungs. Asa result, less oxygen gets into the blood and patients feelshort of breath. Tumors may also block the normal move-ment of mucus up into the throat. As a result, mucusbuilds up in the lungs and infection may develop behindthe tumor. Once lung cancer has developed it frequentlyspreads to other parts of the body.\nThe speed at which non-small cell tumors grow\ndepends on the type of cells that make up the tumor. Thefollowing three types account for the vast majority ofnon-small cell tumors:\n• Adenocarcinomas are the most common and often\ncause no symptoms. Frequently they are not found untilthey are advanced.\n• Squamous cell carcinomas usually produce symptoms\nbecause they are centrally located and block the lungs.\n• Undifferentiated large cell and giant cell carcinomas\ntend to grow rapidly, and spread quickly to other partsof the body.\nWorldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer\nin males, and the fifth most common cancer in women.The worldwide mortality rate for patients with lung can-cer is 86%. In the United States, lung cancer is the lead-ing cause of death from cancer among both men and\nwomen. The World Health Organization estimates thatthe worldwide mortality from lung cancer will increaseto three million by the year 2025. Of those three milliondeaths, almost two and a half million will result fromnon-small cell lung cancer.\nThe incidence of lung cancer is beginning to fall in\ndeveloped countries. This may be a result of antismokingcampaigns. In developing countries, however, rates con-tinue to rise, which may be a consequence of both indus-trialization and the increasing use of tobacco products.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nTobacco smoking accounts for nearly 90% of all\nlung cancers. Giving up tobacco can prevent most lung\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2043Lung cancer, non-small cellcancers. Smoking marijuana cigarettes is considered\nanother risk factor for cancer of the lung. Second handsmoke also contributes to the development of lung canceramong nonsmokers.\nCertain hazardous materials that people may be\nexposed to in their jobs have been shown to cause lungcancer. These include asbestos, coal products, andradioactive substances. Air pollution may also be a con-tributing factor. Exposure to radon, a colorless, odorlessgas that sometimes accumulates in the basement ofhomes, may cause lung cancer in a tiny minority ofpatients. In addition, patients whose lungs are scarredfrom other lung conditions may have an increased risk ofdeveloping lung cancer.\nSymptoms\nLung cancers tend to spread very early, and only\n15% are detected in their early stages. The chances ofearly detection, however, can be improved by seekingmedical care at once if any of the following symptomsappear:\n•a  cough that does not go away\n• chest pain\n•shortness of breath\n• recurrent lung infections, such as bronchitis or pneu-\nmonia\n• bloody or brown-colored spit or phlegm (sputum)\n• persistent hoarseness\n• significant weight loss that is not due to dieting or vig-\norous exercise ; fatigue and loss of appetite\n• unexplained fever\nAlthough these symptoms may be caused by dis-\neases other than lung cancer, it is important to consult adoctor to rule out the possibility of lung cancer.\nIf lung cancer has spread to other organs, the patient\nmay have other symptoms such as headaches, bone frac-\ntures , pain, bleeding, or blood clots.\nDiagnosis\nPhysical examination and diagnostic tests\nThe doctor will first take a detailed medical history\nand assess risk factors. During a complete physical exam-\nination the doctor will examine the patient’s throat to rule\nout other possible causes of hoarseness or coughing, andwill listen to the patient’s breathing and chest sounds.\nIf the doctor has reason to suspect lung cancer, par-\nticularly if the patient has a history of heavy smoking oroccupational exposure to irritating substances, a chest xraymay be ordered to see if there are any masses in the\nlungs. Special imaging techniques, such as computedtomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI), may provide more precise information about thesize, shape, and location of any tumors.\nSputum analysis\nSputum analysis is a noninvasive test that involves\nmicroscopic examination of cells that are coughed upfrom the lungs. This test can diagnose at least 30% oflung cancers, even if tumors are not visible on chest xrays. In addition, the test can detect cancer in its veryearly stages, before it spreads to other regions. The spu-tum test does not provide any information about the loca-tion of the tumor.\nLung biopsy\nLung biopsy is the most definitive diagnostic tool\nfor cancer. It can be performed in three different ways.Bronchoscopy involves the insertion of a slender, lighted\ntube, called a bronchoscope, down the patient’s throatand into the lungs. This test allows the doctor to see thetubes inside the lungs, and to obtain samples of lung tis-sue. If a needle biopsy is to be performed, the location ofthe tumor is first identified using a computerized tomog-raphy (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The doctor then inserts a needle through the chest walland collects a sample of tissue from the tumor. In thethird procedure, known as surgical biopsy, the chest wallis opened up and a part of the tumor, or all of it, isremoved. A doctor who specializes in the study of dis-eased tissue (a pathologist) examines the tumor to identi-fy the cancer’s type and stage.\nTreatment\nStaging\nTreatment for non-small cell lung cancer depends\nprimarily on the stage of the cancer. Staging is a processthat tells the doctor if the cancer has spread and theextent of its spread. The most commonly used treatmentsare surgery, radiation therapy , and chemotherapy .\nNon-small cell lung cancer has six stages:\n• Occult carcinoma. Cancer cells have been found in the\nsputum, but no tumor has yet been found.\n• Stage 0. A small group of cancerous cells have been\nfound in one location.\n• Stage I. The cancer is only in the lung and has not\nspread anywhere else.\n• Stage II. The cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2044Lung cancer, non-small cell• Stage III. The cancer has spread to more distant lymph\nnodes, and/or other parts of the chest like the diaphragm.\n• Stage IV . The cancer has spread to other parts of the\nbody.\nSurgery\nSurgery is the standard treatment for the earlier\nstages of non-small cell lung cancer. The surgeon willdecide on the type of surgery, depending on how much ofthe lung is affected. There are three different types ofsurgical procedures:\n• Wedge resection is the removal of a small part of the\nlung.\n• Lobectomy is the removal of one lobe of the lung. (The\nright lung has three lobes and the left lung has twolobes.)\n• Pneumonectomy is the removal of an entire lung.\nLung surgery is a major procedure and patients can\nexpect to experience pain, weakness in the chest, andshortness of breath. Air and fluid collect in the chest aftersurgery. As a result, patients will need help to turn over,cough, and breath deeply. Patients should be encouragedto perform these activities because they help get rid ofthe air and fluid and speed up recovery. It can takepatients several months before they regain their energyand strength.\nRadiotherapy\nPatients whose cancer has progressed too far for\nsurgery (Stages III and IV) may receive radiotherapy.Radiotherapy involves the use of high-energy rays to killcancer cells. It is used either by itself or in combinationwith surgery or chemotherapy. The amount of radiationused depends on the size and the location of the tumor.\nRadiation therapy may produce such side effects as\ntiredness, skin rashes , upset stomach, and diarrhea . Dry\nor sore throats, difficulty in swallowing, and loss of hairin the treated area are all minor side effects of radiation.These may disappear either during the course of thetreatment or after the treatment is over.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is also given to patients whose cancer\nhas progressed too far for surgery. Chemotherapy is med-ication that is usually given intravenously to kill cancercells. These drugs enter the bloodstream and travel to allparts of the body, killing cancer cells that have spread todifferent organs. Chemotherapy is used as the primarytreatment for cancers that have spread beyond the lungand cannot be removed by surgery. It can also be used inaddition to surgery or radiation therapy.KEY TERMS\nBronchi —The tubes that carry air into the lungs.\nLymph —Clear fluid containing white blood cells\nthat is collected from the tissues of the body andflows in vessels called the lymphatic system.\nLymph node —Small, oval shaped filters in the\nlymphatic system that trap bacteria and otherunwanted particles to ensure their removal fromthe body.\nRespiratory distress —A condition where patients\nwith lung disease are not able to get enough oxygen.\nChemotherapy is tailored to each patient’s needs.\nMost patients are given a combination of several dif-ferent drugs. Because these drugs also harm normalcells, doses are carefully adjusted. Chemotherapyoften has severe side effects, including nausea and\nvomiting , hair loss, anemia, weakening of the immune\nsystem, and sometimes infertility . Most of these side\neffects end when the treatment is over. Other medica-tions can be given to lessen the unpleasant side effectsof chemotherapy.\nAlternative treatment\nBecause non-small cell lung cancer has a poor prog-\nnosis with conventional medical treatment, manypatients are willing to try complementary and alternativetherapies. These therapies are used to try to reducestress , ease side effects and symptoms, or control dis-\nease. Two treatments sometimes used are shark cartilageand mistletoe. Although shark cartilage is thought tointerfere with the tumor’s blood supply, clinical trialshave so far been inconclusive. Mistletoe is a poisonousplant that has been shown to kill cancer cells in the labo-ratory. Again, however, clinical trials with cancerpatients have been inconclusive.\nPatients who decide to try complementary and\nalternative therapies should tell their doctor. Some ofthese therapies may interfere with conventional treat-ment.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer is\nbetter if the disease is found early, and removed surgi-cally. For patients whose disease is caught in Stage I,the survival rate five years after surgery ranges from60% to 80%. Up to 55% of Stage II patients are alive\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2045Lung cancer, non-small cellafter five years, but only about 30% of Stage III\npatients make it to five years. Unfortunately, 85% ofpatients already have at least Stage III cancer by thetime they are diagnosed. Many of these patients havedisease that is too advanced for surgery. Despite treat-ment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the five-year survival for patients with inoperable disease isextremely low.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent lung cancer is not to start\nsmoking or to quit smoking. Secondhand smoke fromother people’s tobacco should also be avoided. Appro-priate precautions should be taken when working withcancer-causing substances (carcinogens). Testing housesfor the presence of radon gas, and removing asbestosfrom buildings have also been suggested as preventivestrategies.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrambilla, Christian, and Elisabeth Brambilla, ed.

In the past, the disease was called oat cellcancer because, when viewed under a microscope, thecancer cells resemble oats. This type of lung cancergrows quickly and is more likely to spread to otherorgans in the body.\nThe lungs are located along with the heart in the\nchest cavity. The lungs are not simply hollow balloons,but have a very organized structure consisting of hollowtubes, blood vessels, and elastic tissue. The hollow tubes,called bronchi, are multi-branched, becoming smallerand more numerous at each branching. They end in tiny,blind sacs made of elastic tissue called alveoli. Thesesacs are where the oxygen a person breathes in is takenup into the blood, and where carbon dioxide moves outof the blood to be breathed out.\nNormal, healthy lungs are continually secreting\nmucus that not only keeps the lungs moist, but also pro-tects the lungs by trapping foreign particles like dust anddirt in breathed air. The inside of the lungs is coveredwith small, hair-like structures called cilia. The ciliamove in such a way that mucus is swept up out of thelungs and into the throat.\nSmall cell lung tumors usually start to develop in the\ncentral bronchi. They grow quickly and prevent the lungsfrom functioning at their full capacity. Tumors mayblock the movement of air through the bronchi in thelungs. As a result, less oxygen gets into the blood andpatients feel short of breath. Tumors may also block thenormal movement of mucus into the throat. As a result,mucus builds up in the lungs and infection may developbehind the tumor.\nLung cancer is a growing global epidemic. World-\nwide, lung cancer is the second most common canceramong both men and women and is the leading cause ofcancer death in both sexes. The worldwide mortality rate\nfor patients with lung cancer is 86%. Of the 160,000deaths from lung cancer that occur annually in the UnitedStates, about 40,000 are caused by small cell lung cancer.Although there are differences in mortality rates betweenethnic groups, this is mainly due to differences in smok-\ninghabits.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2046Lung cancer, small cellCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nTobacco smoking accounts for nearly 90% of all lung\ncancers. The risk of developing lung cancer is increasedfor smokers who start at a young age, and for those whohave smoked for a long time. The risk also increases asmore cigarettes are smoked, and when cigarettes withhigher tar content are smoked. Smoking marijuana ciga-rettes is also a risk factor for lung cancer. These cigaretteshave a higher tar content than tobacco cigarettes.\nCertain hazardous materials that people may be\nexposed to in their jobs have been shown to cause lungcancer. These include asbestos, coal products, and radioac-tive substances. Air pollution may also be a contributingfactor. Exposure to radon, a colorless, odorless gas thatsometimes accumulates in the basement of homes, maycause lung cancer in some patients. In addition, patientswhose lungs are scarred from other lung conditions mayhave an increased risk of developing lung cancer.\nAlthough the exact cause of lung cancer is not known,\npeople with a family history of lung cancer appear to havea slightly higher risk of contracting the disease.Symptoms\nSmall cell lung cancer is an aggressive disease that\nspreads quickly. Symptoms depend on the tumor’s loca-tion within the lung, and on whether the cancer hasspread to other parts of the body. More than 80% ofsmall cell lung cancer patients have symptoms for onlythree months or less, and few cases are detected early.The following symptoms are the most commonly report-ed by small cell lung cancer patients at the time of theirdiagnosis:\n•a  cough that does not go away\n• chest pain\n•shortness of breath and wheezing\n• persistent hoarseness• fatigue and loss of appetite\nAlthough some patients may experience bloody spit\nor phlegm, this symptom is more commonly seen inpatients with other types of lung cancer.\nSmall cell tumors often press against a large blood\nvessel near the lungs called the superior vena cava (SVC),causing a condition known as SCV syndrome. This condi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2047Lung cancer, small cell\nA normal lung (left) and the lung of a cigarette smoker (right). (Photograph by A. Glauberman, Photo Researchers, Inc. Repro-\nduced by permission.)tion may cause patients to retain water, cough, and have\nshortness of breath. Because small cell lung cancer oftenspreads quickly to the bones and central nervous system,patients may also have bone pain, headaches, and seizures.\nDiagnosis\nIf lung cancer is suspected, the doctor will take a\ndetailed medical history that checks both symptoms andrisk factors. During a complete physical examination ,\nthe doctor will examine the patient’s throat to rule outother possible causes of hoarseness or coughing, and lis-ten to the patient’s breathing and the sounds made whenthe patient’s chest and upper back are tapped. A chest x\nraymay be ordered to check for masses in the lungs.\nSpecial imaging techniques, such as computed tomogra-phy (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\nmay provide more precise information about the size,shape, and location of any tumors.Sputum analysis involves microscopic examination\nof the cells that are either coughed up from the lungs, orare collected through a special instrument called a bron-choscope. The sputum test does not, however, provideany information about the location of the tumor and mustbe followed by other tests.\nLung biopsy is the most definitive diagnostic tool\nfor cancer. It can be performed in several different ways.The doctor can perform a bronchoscopy , which involves\nthe insertion of a slender, lighted tube, called a broncho-scope, down the patient’s throat and into the lungs. Inaddition to viewing the passageways of the lungs, thedoctor can use the bronchoscope to obtain samples of thelung tissue. In another procedure known as a needlebiopsy, the location of the tumor is first identified using aCT scan or MRI. The doctor then inserts a needlethrough the chest wall and collects a sample of tissuefrom the tumor. In the third procedure, known as surgicalbiopsy, the chest wall is opened up and a part of thetumor, or all of it, is removed for examination.\nTreatment\nStaging\nStaging procedures are important in lung cancer\nbecause they tell doctors whether patients have diseaseonly in their lungs, or whether the cancer has spread toother parts of the body. To establish the cancer stage,doctors have to perform various tests. These may includebone marrow aspiration and biopsy , CT scans of the\nchest and abdomen, MRI scans of the brain, and radionu-clide bone scans. All of these tests determine the extentto which the cancer has spread. Once the stage is deter-mined, doctors can decide on a course of treatment, andcan have a better idea of the patient’s prognosis.\nUnlike other types of lung cancer, the staging of\nsmall cell lung cancer is relatively simple. This isbecause approximately 70% of patients already havemetastatic disease when they are diagnosed, and smalldifferences in the amount of tumor found in the lungs donot change the prognosis. Small cell lung cancer is usual-ly divided into three stages:\n• Limited stage: The cancer is found only in one lung and\nin lymph nodes close to the lung.\n• Extensive stage: The cancer has spread beyond the\nlungs to other parts of the body.\n• Recurrent stage: The cancer has returned following\ntreatment.\nWithout treatment, small cell lung cancer has the\nmost aggressive clinical course of any type of pulmonarytumor, with median survival from diagnosis of only 2–4\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2048Lung cancer, small cell\nAn x-ray image showing an oval-shaped carcinoma in the\nleft lung (right of image). (Custom Medical Stock Photo.\nReproduced by permission.)months. Compared with other cell types of lung cancer,\nsmall cell lung cancer has a greater tendency to be wide-ly disseminated by the time of diagnosis, but is muchmore responsive to chemotherapy and irradiation.\nTreatment of small cell lung cancer depends on\nwhether the patient has limited, extensive, or recurrentdisease. Treatment usually involves radiotherapy andchemotherapy. Surgery is rarely used for this type of lungcancer because the tumor is usually too advanced.\nPatients with limited-stage disease are usually treat-\ned with chemotherapy. Combinations of two or moredrugs have a better effect than treatment with a singledrug. Up to 90% of patients with this stage of diseasewill respond to chemotherapy. The chemotherapy mostcommonly prescribed is a combination of the drugsetoposide (Vepesid) and cisplatin (Platinol). Combiningchemotherapy with chest radiotherapy and/or occasion-ally surgery has also prolonged survival for limited-stage patients.\nIn addition to chest radiotherapy, some patients are\nalso treated with radiation therapy to the brain, even if\nno cancer is found there. This treatment, called prophy-lactic cranial irradiation (PCI), is given to prevent tumorsfrom forming in the brain. The combination of etoposideand cisplatin chemotherapy with chest radiation therapyand PCI has increased the two-year survival of limited-stage small cell lung cancer patients to almost 50%.\nCombinations of different chemotherapy agents are\nalso used for treating extensive-stage small cell lung can-cer. However, compared with limited-stage patients, thepercentage of extensive-stage patients who respond totherapy is lower. Commonly used drug combinationsinclude cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), doxorubicin(Adriamycin), and vincristine (Oncovin), or etoposideand cisplatin. The addition of radiation therapy tochemotherapy does not improve survival in thesepatients. However, radiation therapy is used for the pal-liative (pain relief) treatment of symptoms of metastaticlung cancer, particularly brain and bone tumors.\nPatients who have recurrent small cell lung cancer\noften become resistant to chemotherapy. These patientsare treated with palliative radiotherapy. Their doctor mayalso recommend that they take part in a clinical trial of anew therapy. Patients whose relapse occurs more than sixmonths after their initial treatment, however, may stillrespond to traditional chemotherapy.\nAlternative treatment\nMany cancer patients have tried using shark carti-\nlage to treat their disease.

Some of thesetherapies may interfere with conventional treatment.\nPrognosis\nSmall cell lung cancer is a very aggressive disease.\nWithout treatment, limited-stage patients will survive forthree to six months, while extensive-stage patients willsurvive six to 12 weeks. However, small cell lung canceris much more responsive to chemotherapy and radiationtherapy than other types of lung cancer. Among patientstreated with chemotherapy, 70–90% have a majorresponse to treatment.\nSurvival in patients responding to therapy is four to\nfive times longer than in patients without treatment. Inaddition, two years after the start of therapy, about 10% ofpatients remain free of disease. In general, women tend tohave a better prognosis than men. Patients whose diseasehas spread to the central nervous system or liver have amuch worse prognosis. Although the overall survival atfive years is 5% to 10%, survival is higher in patients withlimited stage disease. About 70% of patients who are dis-ease free after two years do not relapse. After five to 10disease-free years, relapses are rare.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent lung cancer is either not\nstart smoking, or quit smoking. Secondhand smoke fromother people’s tobacco should also be avoided. Appropri-ate precautions should be taken when working with sub-stances that can cause cancer (carcinogens). Testinghouses for the presence of radon gas, and removing\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2049Lung cancer, small cellasbestos from buildings have also been suggested as pre-\nventive strategies.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPass, Harvey I. et al.

Mucus present in the airways blocks for-eign particles of a certain size, however it is unable to fil-ter all airborne particulates. There are hundreds of sub-stances that can pollute air and harm lungs. Harmfulgases and chemicals are just one type of airborne pollu-tant that can adversely effect the lungs. They include:• vehicle exhaust\n• localized pollutants such as arsenic, asbestos, lead, and\nmercury\n• outdoor pollutants caused by industry and intensified\nby weather conditions\n• household heating, such as wood-burning stoves• household chemical products• tobacco smoke\nLungs respond to irritants in four ways, each of\nwhich can occur separately or, more often, trigger otherresponses.\n•Asthma occurs when irritation causes the smooth mus-\ncles surrounding the airways to constrict.\n• Increased mucus comes from irritated mucus glands\nlining the airway. Excess mucus clogs the airway andprevents air from circulating.\n• Constriction of the lungs results from scarring when the\nsupporting tissues are damaged.\n•Cancer is caused by certain irritants, like asbestos and\ntobacco smoke.\nThe major categories that airborne irritants fall into\nare allergic, organic, inorganic, and poisonous, withmany agents occupying more than one category.\n• Allergic irritants bother only people who are sensitive\nto them. Cat hair, insect parts, and pollen are commonallergens. Chemicals called sulfites, which are widelyused as food preservatives, also cause asthma.\n• There are many organic dusts that irritate the lungs.\nMost of them occur on the job and cause occupationallung disease. Grain dust causes silo filler’s disease.Cotton and other textile dusts cause byssinosis . Mold\nspores in hay cause farmer’s lung.\n• Inorganic dusts and aerosolized chemicals are also\nfound mostly on the job. Classic among them areasbestos and coal dust. Many metals (cadmium,arsenic, chromium, and phosphorus), various other fineparticles (cement, mica, rock), acid fumes, ammonia,ozone, and automobile and industrial emissions are partof a very long list.\n• Most intentional poisons (cyanide, nerve gas) that enter\nthrough the lungs pass through and damage other partsof the body. Mustard gas, used during World War I andbanned since, directly and immediately destroys lungs.\n• Tobacco use scars the lungs and causes emphysema\nand lung cancer.\nCauses and symptoms\nLung disease generates three major symptoms—\ncoughing, wheezing , and shortness of breath . It also\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2050Lung diseases due to gas or chemical exposurepredisposes the lungs to infections such as bronchitis\nand pneumonia . Cancer is a late effect, requiring pro-\nlonged exposure to an irritant. In the case of tobacco, anaverage of a pack of cigarettes a day for forty years, ortwo packs a day for twenty years, will greatly increasethe risk of lung cancer.\nDiagnosis\nA history of exposure combined with a chest x ray\nand lung function studies completes the diagnostic evalu-ation in most cases. Lung function measures the amountof air breathed in and out, the speed it moves, and theeffectiveness of oxygen exchange with the blood. If thecause is still unclear, a lung biopsy reveals the answer.\nTreatment\nEliminating the offending irritant and early antibi-\notics for infection are primary. There are many tech-\nniques available to remove excess mucus from the lungs.Respiratory therapists are experts in these methods.Finally, there are several machines available to enrich theoxygen content of breathed air.\nA new surgical treatment called “lung reduction\nsurgery” is just emerging from the experimental stage. Itpromises substantial return of lung function for selectedpatients with advanced emphysema.\nPrognosis\nMany of these diseases are progressive, because the\nirritants stay in the lungs forever. Others remain stableafter the offensive agents are removed from the environ-ment. Lungs do not heal from destructive damage, butthey can clean out infection and excess mucus, and func-tion better.\nPrevention\nIndustrial air filters, adequate ventilation, and respi-\nrators in polluted work sites are now mandatory. Tobaccosmoke is the world’s leading cause of lung disease andmany other afflictions. Smoking cessation programs are\nwidely available.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBeckett, William S., W. Morgan, and C.

A lung\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2051Lung perfusion and ventilation scanventilation scan measures the ability of the lungs to take\nin air and uses radiopharmaceuticals to produce a pictureof how air is distributed in the lungs.\nPurpose\nLung perfusion scans and lung ventilation scans are\nusually performed in the same session. They are done todetect pulmonary embolisms, determine how muchblood is flowing to lungs, determine which areas of thelungs are capable of ventilation, and assess how well thelungs are functioning after surgery. These tests are calledby different names, including perfusion lung scan,aerosol lung scan, radionucleotide ventilation lung scan,ventilation lung scan, xenon lung scan, ventilation/perfu-sion scanning (VPS), pulmonary scintiphotography, or,most commonly, V/Q scan.\nPrecautions\nThe amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to\nduring these tests is very low and is not harmful. Howev-er, if the patient has had other recent radionuclear tests, itmay be necessary to wait until other radiopharmaceuti-cals have been cleared from the body so that they do notinterfere with these tests.\nDescription\nIn a lung perfusion scan, a small amount of the pro-\ntein labeled with a radioisotope is injected into thepatient’s hand or arm vein. The patient is positioned undera special camera that can detect radioactive material, anda series of photographs are made of the chest. When theseimages are projected onto a screen (oscilloscope), theyshow how the radioactive protein has been distributed bythe blood vessels running through the lungs.\nIn a lung ventilation scan, a mask is placed over the\nnose and mouth, and the patient is asked to inhale andexhale a combination of air and radioactive gas. Picturesare then taken that show the distribution of the gas in thelungs. Each test takes 15-30 minutes.\nPreparation\nThere is little preparation needed for these tests. The\npatient may eat and drink normally before the procedure.Tests to check for pulmonary embolism are often per-\nformed on an emergency basis.\nAftercare\nNo special aftercare is needed. The patient may\nresume normal activities immediately.KEY TERMS\nPulmonary embolism —A blood clot in the arteries\ngoing to the lungs.\nRisks\nThere are practically no risks associated with these\ntests.\nNormal results\nNormal results in both tests show an even distribu-\ntion of radioactive material in all parts of the lungs.\nAbnormal results\nIn the lung perfusion scan, an absence of radioactive\nmarker material suggests decreased blood flow to thatpart of the lung, and possibly a pulmonary embolism .\nHowever, pneumonia ,emphysema , or lung tumors can\ncreate readings on the lung perfusion scan that falselysuggest a pulmonary embolism is present.\nIn the lung ventilation scan, absence of marker\nmaterial when the lung perfusion scan for the area is nor-mal suggests lung disease.\nCertain combinations of abnormalities in lung perfu-\nsion and ventilation scans suggest pulmonary embolism.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPagana, Kathleen Deska.

    "content": "Lung surgery\nDefinition\nLung surgery includes a variety of procedures used\nto diagnose or treat diseases of the lungs. Biopsies areperformed to extract a small amount of tissue for diagno-sis, resections remove a portion of lung tissue, and other\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2052Lung surgerysurgeries are aimed at reducing the volume of the lungs,\nremoving cancerous tumors, or improving lung function.\nPurpose\nThe type of lung surgery performed will depend\nupon the underlying disease or condition, as well as otherfactors.\n• Pneumonectomy usually refers to the removal of a\nlung, or sometimes one or more lobes (sections con-taining lung tissue, air sacs, ducts, and respiratory bron-chiole). It is most commonly indicated in certain formsand stages of lung cancer .\n• Thoracotomy, or surgical incision of the chest wall, is\nused primarily as a diagnostic tool when other proce-dures have failed to provide adequate diagnostic infor-mation.\n• Lobectomy is the term used to describe removal of one\nlobe of a lung. It is most commonly indicated for lungcancer, but may also be used for cystic fibrosis patients\nif other treatments have failed.\n• Other surgical procedures include segmental resection or\nwedge resection. A resection is the removal of a part ofthe lung, often in order to remove a tumor. Wedge resec-tion is removal of a wedge-shaped portion of lung tissue.\n• V olume reduction surgery is a newer surgery used to\nhelp relieve shortness of breath and increase tolerance\nfor exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease, such as emphysema .\n• Other surgeries are continuously improved upon to\nmake biopsy less invasive and surgery more effective,such as video-assisted lobectomy. Other purposes forlung surgery may include severe abscess , areas of long-\nterm infection, or permanently enlarged or collapsedlung tissue.\nPrecautions\nThoracotomy should not be performed on patients\nwhose general health status will not tolerate majorsurgery. Any surgery carries with it risks associated withgeneral anesthesia and possibility of infection. Patientswhose risk for these complications outweighs benefitmay not be considered candidates for lung surgery. Eachindividual patient’s condition will be reviewed prior tothe treatment decision.\nDescription\nLung surgery procedures will vary depending on the\nunderlying cause of the surgical test or intervention. Apatient will be placed under general anesthesia during thesurgery. An incision is made to examine the lungs. Dis-eased tissue is removed and may be sent for biopsy. Fol-\nlowing the surgery, drainage tubes may be placed in thechest to drain fluids, blood, and air from the chest cavity.Tubes will most likely remain in place for one to two days,depending on the surgery and the patient’s condition. Thechest cavity, ribs, and skin are closed and the incision willbe sutured. Hospital stay averages from three to 10 days.\nPneumonectomy consists of removal of all of one\nlung. It may often be indicated only when a lobectomydoes not successfully remove the cancerous or damagedtissue. Thoracotomy consists of reaching the lung tissuethrough incision and obtaining tissue for a biopsy. Thebiopsy is used to diagnose or stage cancer, and thoraco-tomy may be avoided until other less invasive methodshave failed. V olume reduction surgery involves incisionand removal of those parts of the lung or lungs that arethe most destroyed, in order to allow for full function ofthe remaining lung structure. This procedure is stillbeing studied.\nLobectomy is performed in the same general manner\nas other lung surgeries, but will involve removal of anentire lobe of the lung. Most patients with Stage I or IInon-small cell lung cancer will receive this treatment for\ntheir disease, or a less extensive resection. Lobectomymay only be performed if a wedge or segmental resectionis ineffective, but is generally preferred as treatment forprimary lung cancer in any patient who can tolerate theprocedure. Wedge and segmental resections are still majorsurgery, but remove less tissue and may be the first choicefor some patients, such as those with Stage I and Stage IInon-small cell lung cancer. Patients who do not haveenough pulmonary function to undergo a lobectomy willreceive a wedge or segmental resection instead. This maylead to a higher recurrence rate of cancer. In general, thesurgery method chosen will depend on specific circum-stances and consideration of benefit versus risk.\nPreparation\nPreparation for lung surgery is much like that for\nany major surgery. Patients will receive instructions froma physician concerning limit of food or water intake priorto the surgery, as well as risks and expected recovery.Patients should continue to follow treatment for theunderlying condition, unless instructed otherwise by thephysician, and should discuss medications and changesin condition with their physician prior to the surgery.\nAftercare\nThe chest tube inserted at the end of surgery will\nremain in place until the lung has fully expanded. Patientswill be carefully monitored in the hospital for complica-tions and infection. Deep breathing is recommended to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2053Lung surgeryhelp lessen the risk of pneumonia and infection. Breath-\ning exercises will also help expand the lung. After dis-charge from the hospital, the patient may still receivesome pain or infection-fighting medications and should\nrecover within one to three months of the operation.\nRisks\nRisks of lung surgery follows those of any major\nsurgery involving general anesthesia. These risks includereactions to anesthetics or medications, bleeding, infec-tion, and problems restoring breathing. Lung surgery, inparticular, offers the risk of pneumonia and blood clots.Thoracotomy, as a biopsy procedure, offers greater riskthan most biopsy procedures.\nNormal results\nOutcome for any lung surgery depends on many fac-\ntors and the severity of disease. In general, the predictedbenefits, which justified the surgery, are normal expectedresults. Thoracotomy results in a definitive diagnosis inmore than 90% of patients. V olume reduction surgery hasbeen shown to result in relief of some symptoms andimprovement in quality of life for selected patients withsevere emphysema and have shown short-term promise.\nMortality from lung surgery improves as procedures\nmove from the more complete pneumonectomy to lobec-tomy, and the lowest rate for segmental resection.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nNorman, M., et al. “Improved Lung Function and Quality of\nLife Following Increased Elastic Recoil After Lung V ol-ume Reduction Surgery in Emphysema.” Respiratory\nMedicine 92 (1998): 653-658.\nORGANIZATIONS\nAmerican Cancer Society. 1599 Clifton Rd., NE, Atlanta, GA\n30329-4251.

    "content": "Lung transplantation\nDefinition\nLung transplantation involves removal of one or\nboth diseased lungs from a patient and the replacementof the lungs with healthy organs from a donor. Lungtransplantation may refer to single, double, or even heart-lung transplantation.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of lung transplantation is to replace a\nlung that no longer functions, or is cancerous, with ahealthy lung. In order to qualify for lung transplantation, apatient must suffer from severe lung disease which limitsactivities of daily living. There should be potential forrehabilitated breathing function. Attempts at other medicaltreatments should be exhausted before transplantion isconsidered. Many candidates for this procedure have end-stage fibrotic lung disease, are dependent on oxygen thera-py, and are likely to die of their disease in 12-18 months.\nPatients with emphysema or chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD) should be under 60 years ofage, have a life expectancy without transplantation oftwo years or less, progressive deterioration, and emotion-al stability in order to be considered for lung transplanta-tion. Young patients with end-stage silicosis (a progres-\nsive lung disease) may be candidates for lung or heart-lung transplantation. Patients with Stage III or Stage IVsarcoidosis (a chronic lung disease) with cor pulmonale\nshould be considered as early as possible for lung trans-plantation. Other indicators of lung transplantationinclude pulmonary vascular disease and chronic pul-monary infection.\nPrecautions\nPatients who have diseases or conditions which may\nmake them more susceptible to organ rejection should notreceive a lung transplant.

There are a variety of protocols that are used todetermine if a patient will be placed on a transplant recipi-ent list, and criteria may vary depending on location.\nDescription\nOnce a patient has been selected as a possible organ\nrecipient, the process of waiting for a donor organ matchbegins. The donor organ must meet clear requirementsfor tissue match in order to reduce the chance of organrejection. It is estimated that it takes an average of oneto two years to receive a suitable donor lung, and thewait is made less predictable by the necessity for tissuematch. Patients on a recipient list must be available andready to come to the hospital immediately when a donormatch is found, since the life of the lungs outside thebody is brief.\nSingle lung transplantation is performed via a stan-\ndard thoracotomy (incision in the chest wall) with thepatient under general anesthesia. Cardiopulmonarybypass (diversion of blood flow from the heart) is notalways necessary for a single lung transplant. If bypass isnecessary, it involves re-routing of the blood throughtubes to a heart-lung bypass machine. Double lung trans-plantation involves implanting the lungs as two separatelungs, and cardiopulmonary bypass is usually required.The patient’s lung or lungs are removed and the donorlungs are stitched into place. Drainage tubes are insertedinto the chest area to help drain fluid, blood, and air outof the chest. They may remain in place for several days.Transplantation requires a long hospital stay and recov-ery can last up to six months.\nHeart-lung transplants always require the use of car-\ndiopulmonary bypass. An incision is made through the mid-dle of the sternum. The heart, lung, and supporting struc-tures are transplanted into the recipient at the same time.\nPreparation\nIn addition to tests and criteria for selection as a can-\ndidate for transplantation, patients will be prepared bydiscussing the procedure, risks, and expected prognosisat length with their doctor. Patients should continue tofollow all therapies and medications for treatment of theunderlying disease unless otherwise instructed by theirphysician. Since lung transplantation takes place undergeneral anesthesia, normal surgical and anesthesia prepa-ration should be taken when possible. These include nofood or drink from midnight before the surgery, discus-sion of current medications with the physician, andinforming the physician of any changes in conditionwhile on the recipient waiting list.KEY TERMS\nPulmonary —Refers to the respiratory system, or\nbreathing function and system.\nSarcoidosis —A chronic disease with unknown\ncause that involves formation of nodules in bones,skin, lymph nodes, and lungs.\nSilicosis —A progressive disease that results in\nimpairment of lung function and is caused byinhalation of dust containing silica.\nAftercare\nCareful monitoring will take place in a recovery\nroom immediately following the surgery and in thepatient’s hospital room. Patients must take immunosup-pression, or anti-rejection, drugs to reduce the risk ofrejection of the transplanted organ. The body considersthe new organ an invader and will fight its presence. Theanti-rejection drugs lower the body’s immune function inorder to improve acceptance of the new organs. This alsomakes the patient more susceptible to infection.\nFrequent check-ups with a physician, including x\nray and blood tests, will be necessary following surgery,probably for a period of several years.\nRisks\nLung transplantation is a complicated and risky pro-\ncedure, partly because of the organs and systemsinvolved, and also because of the risk of rejection by therecipient’s body. Acute rejection most often occurs withinthe first four months following surgery, but may occuryears later. Infection is a substantial risk for organ recipi-ents. An early complication of the surgery can be poorhealing of the bronchial and tracheal openings createdduring the surgery. A late complication and risk is chronicrejection.

    "content": "Luteinizing hormone test\nDefinition\nThe luteinizing hormone (LH) test is a test of the\nblood or urine to measure the level of luteinizing hormone(lutropin). This hormone level is highest immediatelybefore a woman ovulates during her menstrual cycle.\nPurpose\nThe LH test is frequently used to determine the tim-\ning of ovulation. Couples who are trying to become preg-nant may use information about the timing of ovulationto improve their chance of conception. The LH test andother hormone tests may be used during infertility\nscreening to chart a woman’s menstrual cycle. It mayalso be used during preparation for in vitro fertilization ,\nto determine when eggs are mature and ready to beremoved from the ovary.\nDescription\nLutenizing hormone is a hormone released by the\npituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain. Thehormone stimulates the ovaries to produce and releaseeggs each month during the menstrual cycle. The level ofLH in the blood is highest before ovulation. This increasein hormone level is sometimes called a “surge.” A urineor blood sample can be analyzed by a laboratory for thelevel of LH present. An LH test may be used as part of aninfertility screening to determine if there is a hormonalimbalance that might make it difficult to become preg-nant. If fertility drugs are given to stimulate ovulation, anLH test can help determine the best time for sexual inter-course. The LH test may also be used to determine wheneggs are mature enough to be surgically removed fromthe ovary as part of the in vitro fertilization process. LHtests may also aid in the diagnoses of polycystic ovarydisease, premature ovarian failure, and menopause .\nA urine LH detection kit is also available for use at\nhome. These are sometimes called “ovulation tests” andare similar to home pregnancy test kits. A sample of the\nwoman’s first morning urine is tested with the materialsprovided in the kit. These home tests are often used bywomen who want to become pregnant. By monitoringlevels of LH and watching for the “surge,” they can timesexual intercourse to coincide with ovulation, increasingthe chance that the egg will be fertilized.\nPreparation\nIf a blood sample is taken, the skin around the vein\nwhere the needle will be inserted is swabbed with anantiseptic. No special preparation is necessary for collec-tion of a urine sample.\nAftercare\nNo special aftercare is required. If the blood is test-\ned, as with any blood sampling, the area where the nee-dle was inserted should be kept clean.\nRisks\nThere are no significant risks associated with either\nthe blood or urine test for LH.\nNormal results\nThe level of LH in the blood or urine will vary\ndepending on when the sample was taken during themenstrual cycle. LH levels will be highest around thetime of ovulation, about halfway between a woman’smenstrual periods. Levels will be lower during the rest ofthe month. Women who have already experiencedmenopause will normally have lower LH levels.\nAbnormal results\nLH levels that remain low throughout the menstrual\ncycle may indicate a hormonal imbalance that could pre-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2056Luteinizing hormone testvent ovulation.

    "content": "Lyme disease\nDefinition\nLyme disease is an infection transmitted by the bite\nof ticks carrying the spiral-shaped bacterium Borrelia\nburgdorferi . The disease was named for Lyme, Connecti-\ncut, the town where it was first diagnosed in 1975 after apuzzling outbreak of arthritis. The organism was namedfor its discoverer, Willy Burgdorfer. The effects of thisdisease can be long-term and disabling unless it is recog-nized and treated properly with antibiotics .\nDescription\nLyme disease, which is also called Lyme borreliosis,\nis a vector-borne disease. This term means that it is deliv-ered from one host to another. In this case, a tick bearingthe Borrelia burgdorferi organism literally inserts it into\na host’s bloodstream when it bites the host to feed on itsblood. It is important to note that neither Borrelia\nburgdorferi nor Lyme disease can be transmitted directly\nfrom one person to another, or from pets to humans.\nIn the United States, Lyme disease accounts for\nmore than 90% of all reported vector-borne illnesses. It isKEY TERMS\nLutropin —Another term for luteinizing hormone,\nthis hormone stimulates the development andrelease of the egg from the ovary.a significant public health problem and continues to be\ndiagnosed in significant numbers. More than 99,000cases were reported between 1982 and 1996. When thenumbers for 1996 Lyme disease cases reported were tal-lied, there were 16,455 new cases , a record high follow-\ning a drop in reported cases from 1994 (13,043 cases) to1995 (11,700 cases). Controversy clouds the true inci-dence of Lyme disease because no test is definitivelydiagnostic for the disease, and the broad spectrum ofLyme disease’s symptoms mimic those of so many otherdiseases. Originally, public health specialists thoughtLyme disease was limited geographically in the UnitedStates to the East Coast. We now know it occurs in moststates, with the highest number of cases in the easternthird of the country and a strip along the West Coast thatincludes California and Oregon. As of 2001, Lyme dis-ease is also found across Europe, in the countries of theformer Soviet Union, and in China and Japan.\nThe risk for acquiring Lyme disease varies, depend-\ning on what stage in its life cycle a tick has reached. Atick passes through three stages of development—larva,nymph, and adult—each of which is dependent on a livehost for food. In the United States, Borrelia burgdorferi\nis borne by ticks of several species in the genus Ixodes ,\nwhich usually feed on the white-footed mouse and deer(and are often called deer ticks). In the summer, the lar-val ticks hatch from eggs laid in the ground and feed byattaching themselves to small animals and birds. At thisstage they are not a problem for humans. It is the nextstage—the nymph—that causes most cases of Lyme dis-ease. Nymphs are very active from spring through earlysummer, at the height of outdoor activity for most peo-ple. Because they are still quite small (less than 2 mm),they are difficult to spot, giving them ample opportunityto transmit Borrelia burgdorferi while feeding.\nAlthough far more adult ticks than nymphs carry Borre-\nlia burgdorferi , the adult ticks are much larger, more\neasily noticed, and more likely to be removed before the24 hours or more of continuous feeding needed to trans-mit Borrelia burgdorferi .\nCauses and symptoms\nLyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi .\nOnce Borrelia burgdorferi gains entry to the body\nthrough a tick bite, it can move through the bloodstreamquickly. Only 12 hours after entering the bloodstream,Borrelia burgdorferi can be found in cerebrospinal fluid\n(which means it can affect the nervous system). TreatingLyme disease early and thoroughly is important becauselyme disease can hide for long periods within the body ina clinically latent state. That ability explains why symp-toms can recur in cycles and can flare up after months oryears, even over decades. It is important to note, howev-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2057Lyme diseaseer, that not many people who are exposed to Borrelia\nburgdorferi develops the disease.\nLyme disease is usually described in terms of length\nof infection (time since the person was bitten by a tickinfected with lyme disease) and whether Borrelia\nburgdorferi is localized or disseminated (spread through\nthe body by fluids and cells carrying Borrelia burgdor-\nferi). Furthermore, when and how symptoms of Lyme\ndisease appear can vary widely from patient to patient.People who experience recurrent bouts of symptoms overtime are said to have chronic lyme disease.\nEarly, localized Lyme disease\nThe most recognizable indicator of Lyme disease\nis a rash around the site of the tick bite. Often, the tickexposure has not been recognized. The eruption mightbe warm or itch. The rash—erythema migrans (EM)-generally develops within three to 30 days and usuallybegins as a round, red patch that expands outward.About 75% of patients with Lyme disease develop EM.Clearing may take place from the center out, leaving abull’s-eye effect; in some cases, the center gets redderinstead of clearing. The rash may look like a bruise onpeople with dark skin. Of those who develop lyme dis-\nease, about 50% notice flu-like symptoms, includingfatigue ,headache , chills and fever , muscle and joint\npain , and lymph node swelling. However, a rash at the\nsite can also be an allergic reaction to the tick salivarather than an indicator of lyme disease, particularly ifthe rash appears in lessthan three days and disappears\nonly days later.\nLate, disseminated disease and chronic Lyme\ndisease\nWeeks, months, or even years after an untreated tick\nbite, symptoms can appear in several forms, including:\n• fatigue, forgetfulness, confusion, mood swings, irri-\ntability, numbness\n• neurologic problems, such as pain (unexplained and not\ntriggered by an injury), Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis ,\nusually one-sided but may be on both sides), and amimicking of the inflammation of brain membranesknown as meningitis (fever, severe headache)\n• arthritis (short episodes of pain and swelling in joints)\nand other musculoskeletal complaints.

Lyme dis-ease may mimic other conditions, including chronic\nfatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and\nother diseases with many symptoms involving multiplebody systems. Differential diagnosis (distinguishingkyme disease from other diseases) is based on clinicalevaluation with laboratory tests used for clarificationwhen necessary. A two-test approach is common to con-firm the results. Because of the potential for misleadingresults (false-positive and false-negative), laboratorytests alone cannot establish the diagnosis.In February 1999 the Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) approved a new blood test for Lyme diseasecalled PreVue. The test, which searches for antigens(substances that stimulate the production of antibodies)produced by Borrelia burgdorferi , gives results within\none hour in the doctor’s office. A positive result fromthe PreVue test is confirmed by a second blood testknown as the Western blot, which must be done in alaboratory.\nDoctors generally know which disease-causing\norganisms are common in their geographic area. Themost helpful piece of information is whether a tick biteor rash was noticed and whether it happened locally orwhile traveling. Doctors may not consider Lyme diseaseif it is rare locally, but will take it into account if a patientmentions vacationing in an area where the disease iscommonly found.\nTreatment\nThe treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotic thera-\npy; however, overprescribing of antibiotics can lead toserious problems, so the decision to treat must be made\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2059Lyme disease\n18\n19\n6422 251\n19\n52\n27\n924 9241028\n323263\n2612\n1\n5596657281453013962\n00\n3\n1\n1\n97000\n5\n36\n42\nHI 1Reported number of Lyme disease cases by state\nUnited States, 1996*\n*n = 16,455CT 3104\nDE 173DC 3MD 447MA 321NH 47NJ 534VT 26  \nLyme disease accounts for more than 90% of all reported vector-borne illnesses in the United States.

Disease organisms can develop resistance to\nfamilies of medications over time, rendering the drugsuseless. Furthermore, testing and treatments can beexpensive. If a patient has strong indications of Lymedisease (symptoms and medical history), the doctor willprobably begin treatment on the presumption of thisdisease. The American College of Physicians recom-mends treatment for a patient with a rash resemblingEM or who has arthritis, a history of an EM-type rash,and a previous tick bite.\nThe benefits of treating early must be weighed\nagainst the risks of over treatment. The longer a patient isill with lyme disease before treatment, the longer thecourse of therapy must be, and the more aggressive thetreatment. The development of opportunistic organismsmay produce other symptoms. For example, after long-term antibiotic therapy, patients can become more sus-ceptible to yeast infections. Treatment may also be asso-ciated with adverse drug reactions.\nFor most patients, oral antibiotics (doxycycline or\namoxicillin) are prescribed for 21 days. When symptomsindicate nervous system involvement or a severe episodeof Lyme disease, intravenous antibiotic (ceftriaxone)may be given for 14-30 days. Some physicians considerintravenous ceftriaxone the best therapy for any latemanifestation of disease, but this is controversial. Corti-\ncosteroids (oral) may be prescribed if eye abnormalities\noccur, but they should not be used without first consult-ing an eye doctor.\nThe doctor may have to adjust the treatment regimen\nor change medications based on the patient’s response.Treatment can be difficult because Borrelia burgdorferi\ncomes in several strains (some may react to differentantibiotics than others) and may even have the ability toswitch forms during the course of infection. Also, Borrelia\nburgdorferi can shut itself up in cell niches, allowing it to\nhide from antibiotics. Finally, antibiotics can kill Borrelia\nburgdorferi only while it is active rather than dormant.\nAlternative treatment\nSupportive therapies may minimize symptoms of\nLD or improve the immune response. These include vita-min and nutritional supplements, mostly for chronicfatigue and increased susceptibility to infection. Forexample, yogurt and Lactobacillus acidophilus prepara-\ntions help fight yeast infections, which are common inpeople on long-term antibiotic therapy. In addition,botanical medicine and homeopathy can be considered\nto help bring the body’s systems back to a state of healthand well being. A Western herb, spilanthes ( Spilanthes\nspp.), may be effective in treating diseases like LD thatare caused by spirochetes (spiral-shaped bacteria).Prognosis\nIf aggressive antibiotic therapy is given early, and\nthe patient cooperates fully and sticks to the medicationschedule, recovery should be complete. Only a small per-centage of lyme disease patients fail to respond orrelapse (have recurring episodes). Most long-term effectsof the disease result when diagnosis and treatment isdelayed or missed. Co-infection with other infectiousorganisms spread by ticks in the same areas as Borrelia\nburgdorferi (babesiosis and ehrlichiosis , for instance)\nmay be responsible for treatment failures or more severesymptoms. Lyme disease has been responsible fordeaths, but they are rare.\nPrevention\nGet vaccinated\nA vaccine against Lyme disease was approved by the\nFDA in 1999. The vaccine, called LYMErix, appears towork by stimulating the production of antibodies inhuman blood that kill Lyme disease spirochetes in the gutof the tick when the tick feeds on a vaccinated person.The vaccine is given in three doses over a one-year peri-od; the first dose is followed by a second dose one monthlater, and a third dose a year after the first. The dosesshould be timed so that the second and third doses aregiven several weeks before the beginning of spring. It isnot known how long the vaccine protects people againstLyme disease.\nHousehold pets can get lyme disease and develop\nthe same joint pains and fever as humans, but dogs atleast can also be protected by vaccination . As of 1999,\nthere are three lyme vaccines available for dogs, calledLymeVax, Galaxy Lyme, and Canine Recombinant lyme.Healthy dogs nine weeks or older can be vaccinated.There is no vaccine available as yet for cats.\nAlthough LYMErix protects most people, it is not\n100% effective against Lyme disease. It should not beconsidered a substitute for other preventive measures.The best prevention strategy is through minimizing riskof exposure to ticks and using personal protection pre-cautions.\nMinimize risk of exposure\nPrecautions to avoid contact with ticks include mov-\ning leaves and brush away from living quarters. Mostimportant are personal protection techniques when out-doors, such as:\n• spraying tick repellent on clothing and exposed skin.\n• wearing light-colored clothing to maximize ability to\nsee ticks\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2060Lyme disease• tucking pant legs into socks or boot top\n• checking children and pets frequently for ticks\nIn highly tick-populated areas, each individual\nshould be inspected at the end of the day to look forticks.\nMinimize risk of disease\nThe two most important factors are removing the\ntick quickly and carefully, and seeking a doctor’s evalua-tion at the first sign of symptoms of Lyme disease. Whenin an area that may be tick-populated:\n• check for ticks, particularly in the area of the groin,\nunderarm, behind ears, and on the scalp\n• stay calm and grasp the tick as near to the skin as possi-\nble, using a tweezer\n• to minimize the risk of squeezing more bacteria into the\nbite, pull straight back steadily and slowly\n• do not try to make the tick back out by using vaseline,\nalcohol, or a lit match\n• place the tick in a closed container (for species identifi-\ncation later, should symptoms develop) or dispose of itby flushing\n• see a physician for any sort of rash or patchy discol-\noration that appears three to 30 days after a tick bite\nMedical studies to date do not support the preventa-\ntive use of antibiotics after a tick bite, even if the tick hasbeen identified as a deer tick. The risk of Lyme diseaseafter a deer tick exposure appears to be quite low.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Bacterial Diseases: Lyme Disease.” In The Merck Manual of\nDiagnosis and Therapy , edited by Mark H.

    "content": "Lymph node biopsy\nDefinition\nA lymph node biopsy is a procedure in which all or\npart of a lymph node is removed and examined to deter-mine if there is cancer within the node.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2061Lymph node biopsyPurpose\nThe lymph system is the body’s primary defense\nagainst infection. It consists of the spleen, tonsils, thy-mus, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and the clear, slightlyyellow fluid called lymph. These components produceand transport white blood cells called lymphocytes andmacrophages that rid the body of infection. The lymphsystem is also involved in the production of antibodies.Antibodies are proteins that fight bacteria, viruses, andother foreign materials that enter the body.\nThe lymph vessels are similar to veins, only instead\nof carrying blood as veins do, they circulate lymph tomost tissues in the body. Lymph nodes are about 600small, bean-shaped collections of tissue found along thelymph vessel. They produce cells and proteins that fightinfection, and clean and filter lymph. Lymph nodes aresometimes called lymph glands, although they are nottrue glands. When someone talks about having swollenglands, they are actually referring to lymph nodes.\nNormal lymph glands are no larger than 0.5 in (1.3\ncm) in diameter and are difficult to feel. However, lymphnodes can enlarge to greater than 2.5 in (6 cm) and canbecome sore. Most often the swelling is caused by an\ninfection, but it can also be caused by cancer.\nCancers can metastasize (spread) through the lymph\nsystem from the site of the original tumor to distant partsof the body where secondary tumors are formed. The pur-pose of a lymph node biopsy is to determine the cause ofthe swelling and/or to see if cancer has begun to spreadthrough the lymph system. This information is importantin staging the cancer and devising a treatment plan.\nPrecautions\nWomen who are pregnant should inform their doctor\nbefore a lymph node biopsy, although pregnancy will\nnot affect the results.\nDescription\nThere are three kinds of lymph node biopsy. Sentinel\nlymph node mapping and biopsy is a promising newtechnique that is discussed in its own entry. Fine needleaspiration (FNA) biopsy, often just called needle biopsy,is done when the lymph node of interest is near the sur-face of the body. A hematologist (a doctor who special-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2062Lymph node biopsyEpithelioid cells\nL YMPH NODEGranuloma Lymphocytes\nGiant cells\nLymph node biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of lymph node tissue is removed for laboratory analysis. It is generally\nperformed on an outpatient basis. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)izes in blood diseases) usually performs the test. In FNA\nbiopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin and into thelymph node, and a sample of tissue is drawn out of thenode. This material is preserved and sent to the laborato-ry for examination.\nAdvantages of a needle biopsy are that the test is\nminimally invasive. Only a local anesthetic is used, theprocedure generally takes less than half an hour, andthere is little pain afterwards. The disadvantage is that\ncancer may not be detected in the small sample of cellsremoved by the needle.\nOpen lymph node biopsy is a surgical procedure. It\nis done by a surgeon under general anesthesia on lymphnodes in the interior of the body and under local anesthe-sia on surface lymph nodes where FNA biopsy is consid-ered inadequate. Once there is adequate anesthesia, thesurgeon makes a small cut and removes either the entirelymph node or a slice of tissue that is then sent to the lab-oratory for examination. Results in both kinds of biop-sies take one to three days.\nOpen biopsy can be advantageous in that it is easier\nto detect and identify the type of cancer in a large pieceof tissue. Also, lymph nodes deep in the body can besampled. Disadvantages include a longer recovery time,soreness at the biopsy site for several days, and the use ofdeeper anesthesia, increasing the risks to the patient. Theprocedure is done in a hospital or outpatient surgery cen-ter and takes about an hour, with additional time torecover from general anesthesia.\nPreparation\nNo particular preparation is necessary for a needle\nbiopsy. For an open biopsy, patients need standard pre-operative blood tests and other tests to evaluate generalhealth. The doctor should be informed about any medica-tions (prescription, non-prescription, or herbal) thepatient is taking, as well as past bleeding problems orallergies to medication or anesthesia.\nAftercare\nLittle aftercare is needed in a needle biopsy other\nthan a bandage to keep the biopsy site clean. Patientswho have general anesthesia for an open biopsy oftenfeel drowsy and tired for several days following the pro-cedure, and should not plan to drive home after biopsy.The incision site must be kept clean and dry, and a fol-low-up visit to check on healing is usually necessary.\nRisks\nThere are few risks associated with lymph node\nbiopsy.

    "title": "Lymphadenitis",
    "content": "Lymphadenitis\nDefinition\nLymphadenitis is the inflammation of a lymph node.\nIt is often a complication of a bacterial infection of awound, although it can also be caused by viruses or otherdisease agents. Lymphadenitis may be either generalized,involving a number of lymph nodes; or limited to a fewnodes in the area of a localized infection. Lymphadenitisis sometimes accompanied by lymphangitis, which is theinflammation of the lymphatic vessels that connect thelymph nodes.\nDescription\nLymphadenitis is marked by swollen lymph nodes\nthat are painful, in most cases, when the doctor touchesthem. If the lymphadenitis is related to an infectedwound, the skin over the nodes may be red and warm tothe touch. If the lymphatic vessels are also infected, therewill be red streaks extending from the wound in thedirection of the lymph nodes. In most cases, the infec-tious organisms are hemolytic Streptococci or Staphylo-\ncocci . Hemolytic means that the bacteria produce a toxin\nthat destroys red blood cells.\nThe extensive network of lymphatic vessels through-\nout the body and their relation to the lymph nodes helpsto explain why bacterial infection of the nodes canspread rapidly to or from other parts of the body. Lym-phadenitis in children often occurs in the neck areabecause these lymph nodes are close to the ears andthroat, which are frequent locations of bacterial infec-tions in children.\nCauses and symptoms\nStreptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria are the\nmost common causes of lymphadenitis, although viruses,protozoa, rickettsiae, fungi, and the tuberculosis bacillus\ncan also infect the lymph nodes. Diseases or disordersthat involve lymph nodes in specific areas of the bodyinclude rabbit fever (tularemia ),cat-scratch disease ,\nlymphogranuloma venereum ,chancroid ,genital her-\npes, infected acne , dental abscesses, and bubonic\nplague . In children, tonsillitis or bacterial sore throats\nare the most common causes of lymphadenitis in theneck area. Diseases that involve lymph nodes throughoutthe body include mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus\ninfection ,toxoplasmosis , and brucellosis .\nThe early symptoms of lymphadenitis are swelling\nof the nodes caused by a buildup of tissue fluid and anincreased number of white blood cells resulting from thebody’s response to the infection. Further developmentsinclude fever, often as high as 101-102°F (38-39°C)together with chills, loss of appetite, heavy perspiration,a rapid pulse, and general weakness.\nDiagnosis\nPhysical examination\nThe diagnosis of lymphadenitis is usually based on a\ncombination of the patient’s history, the external symp-toms, and laboratory cultures. The doctor will press (pal-pate) the affected lymph nodes to see if they are sore ortender. Swollen nodes without soreness are often causedby cat-scratch disease. In children, the doctor will needto rule out mumps , tumors in the neck region, and con-\ngenital cysts that resemble swollen lymph nodes.\nAlthough lymphadenitis is usually diagnosed in\nlymph nodes in the neck, arms, or legs, it can also occur\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2064Lymphadenitisin lymph nodes in the chest or abdomen. If the patient\nhas acutely swollen lymph nodes in the groin, the doctorwill need to rule out a hernia in the groin that has failed\nto reduce (incarcerated inguinal hernia). Hernias occur in1% of the general population; 85% of patients with her-nias are male.\nLaboratory tests\nThe most significant tests are a white blood cell\ncount (WBC) and a blood culture to identify the organ-\nism. A high proportion of immature white blood cellsindicates a bacterial infection. Blood cultures may bepositive, most often for a species of staphylococcus orstreptococcus. In some cases, the doctor may order abiopsy of the lymph node.\nTreatment\nMedications\nThe medications given for lymphadenitis vary\naccording to the bacterium or virus that is causing it. Ifthe patient also has lymphangitis, he or she will be treat-ed with antibiotics , usually penicillin G (Pfizerpen, Pen-\ntids), nafcillin (Nafcil, Unipen), or cephalosporins . Ery-\nthromycin (Eryc, E-Mycin, Erythrocin) is given topatients who are allergic to penicillin.\nSupportive care\nSupportive care of lymphadenitis includes resting\nthe affected limb and treating the area with hot moistcompresses.\nSurgery\nCellulitis associated with lymphadenitis should not\nbe treated surgically because of the risk of spreading theinfection. Pus is drained only if there is an abscess and\nusually after the patient has been started on antibiotictreatment. In some cases, a biopsy of an inflamed lymphnode is necessary if no diagnosis has been made and noresponse to treatment has occurred.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery is good if the patient is\ntreated promptly with antibiotics. In most cases, theinfection can be brought under control in three or fourdays. Patients with untreated lymphadenitis may developblood poisoning (septicemia), which is sometimes fatal.\nPrevention\nPrevention of lymphadenitis depends on prompt\ntreatment of bacterial and viral infections.Resources\nBOOKS\nBerman, Stephen, and Ken Chan. “Ear, Nose, & Throat.” In\nCurrent Pediatric Diagnosis & Treatment , ed.

The watery fluidcalled lymph seeps out of the blood into tissues, andwhile journeying back to the heart, it picks up germs,cancer cells, and some waste products. Lymph passes\nthrough the lymph nodes, which are major arsenals ofimmune defense that attack germs carried in the lymph.Cancer cells are also subject to attack in lymph nodes.\nCancers of the lymph system, such as Hodgkin’s\ndisease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, spread through-\nout the body. Treatment often depends upon finding allthe disease and directing radiation to each location. Plan-ning other kinds of treatment, such as surgery orchemotherapy , may also require that the full extent of\nthe disease be known.\nThe lymphatic circulation may become clogged by\ninfection, injury, or several other types of cancer thathave spread through lymphatic channels. Swelling,sometimes massive, can result from blocked lymphatics.The most outstanding example of this is the tropical dis-ease filariasis , which results in the swelling of the legs\ntermed elephangiasis.\nLymphangiography gives precise information on the\nextent and location of lymph vessels and lymph nodes.Oftentimes, it is performed to evaluate the extent of alymphatic cancer. Rarely, it is a tool, which aids surgeonsattempting to reconstruct the lymphatics.\nPrecautions\nLymphangiography should not be performed on\npatients with dye or shellfish allergies or on patients\nwith chronic lung disease, kidney disease, heart disease,or liver disease.\nDescription\nA lymphangiogram begins by injecting a blue dye\ninto a hand or foot. The lymph system picks up dye,which in turn will highlight the lymph vessels. Thisprocess may take a full day.

X rays\noutline the journey of the contrast agent as it travels tothe heart through lymph vessels and nodes.\nPreparation\nUnless a dye allergy is suspected, no special prepa-\nration is need. If an allergy is suspected, a non-ionic con-trast agent can be administered instead.\nAftercare\nPrior to suture removal seven to 10 days after the\nprocedure, the patient should watch for any sign of infec-tion around the site.\nRisks\nLipid pneumonia can occur if the contrast agent\npenetrates the thoracic duct. An allergic reaction to thecontrast agent is possible, causing a range of symptomsthat can range from innocuous to life threatening.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMerrill, Vinta. “Lymphangiography.” In Atlas of Roentgeno-\ngraphic Positions and Standard Radiologic Procedures.Saint Louis: The C.

    "title": "Lymphedema",
    "content": "Lymphedema\nDefinition\nLymphedema is the swelling of tissues ( edema ),\nusually the feet and legs, due to lymphatic obstruction.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2066LymphangiographyDescription\nLymphatic fluid seeps out of the blood circulation\ninto the tissues. It returns to the heart through separatechannels called lymphatics, carrying waste products andgerms. On its way to the heart, it passes through lymphnodes, where infecting germs (including some cancers)are attacked by the body’s defense mechanisms.\nIf lymphatic channels are obstructed or inadequate,\nfluid backs up and causes edema. Tissue fluid can alsoreturn to the circulation through tissues, without usingthe lymphatics, but gravity hinders this flow. So lym-phedema is usually confined to the feet and legs.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are several types of congenital abnormalities\nassociated with other birth defects of the lymphatics,\nwhich cause this condition. One in 10,000 people havethis type of lymphedema.\nLymphatics can be damaged or obstructed by many\ndifferent agents. Repeated bouts of blood poisoning can\nscar the vessels. Surgery to remove cancerous lymphnodes or radiation therapy can damage them. Cancer\nitself, as it invades the lymph system, as well as severalother infectious and inflammatory conditions, can resultin blockage of lymph flow. The most common world-wide cause of lymphedema is a group of worms knownas filaria. Filaria can be found in most of the developingregions of the world. They enter humans through insectbites, mostly mosquitoes, and take up residence in lym-phatic channels, irritating them enough to scar them andimpair their ability to carry lymph. Long-standing lym-phatic filariasis can cause massive swelling of the legs,\nearning the name elephantiasis .\nDiagnosis\nSince other types of swelling may look similar to\nlymphedema, precise diagnostic tools must be used.Ultrasound, computed tomography scans (CT), and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may help\nwith diagnosis. Lymphangiography may be needed to\nclarify the cause.\nTreatment\nPhysical activity can pump some of the fluid out of\nthe tissues. Compression stockings are of some value, asare devices that actively squeeze fluid out of tissues.Diuretics may alleviate some of the edema. Because the\nability of the skin to defend itself is hampered by theswelling, infections are more common. It is thereforeimportant to care for wounds and to treat infections early.KEY TERMS\nBlood poisoning —Infection that has escaped local\ndefenses and spread into the circulation.\nWhen caused by infection, lymphedema can be\ntreated by eliminating the underlying infection withantibiotics .\nReconstructing lymphatic channels using microvas-\ncular surgery has recently achieved some success.\nPrognosis\nIf congenital, lymphedema is a progressive and life-\nlong condition. If secondary or caused by an underlyingdisease or infection, lymphedema can be treated by treat-ing the disease.\nPrevention\nWhen traveling in regions known to have filaria,\navoidance of insect bites is crucial. Prompt and effectivetreatment of the infection will prevent the consequences.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCreager, Mark A., and Victor A.

    "title": "Lymphocyte typing",
    "content": "Lymphocyte typing\nDefinition\nLymphocyte typing focuses on identifying the num-\nbers and relative percentages of lymphocytes in an indi-vidual’s bloodstream. Lymphocytes, primarily T cellsand B cells, are types of white blood cells, the underlyingsupports of the immune system in the bloodstream.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2067Lymphocyte typingPurpose\nDetermining the numbers and relative percentages\nof T cells and B cells provides information on the state ofa person’s immune system. By comparing these values tonormal numbers and percentages, the presence of diseaseand the side effects of certain drugs can be revealed.Lymphocyte typing can also show whether a person hasbeen exposed to certain poisonous substances.\nDescription\nTo do a white blood cell count, a small amount of\nblood is drawn from a vein. The total number of whiteblood cells is calculated, either through microscopicexamination of a blood smear or by using automatedcounting equipment. For a white blood cell count withdifferential, 100 white blood cells are counted and theproportion of each type is calculated. Since T cells and Bcells have similar appearances, a differential can onlygive the proportion of lymphocytes in the blood, not theproportion of specific lymphocyte types.\nFor more specific information on B cells and T cells,\nit is necessary to divide the blood into its separate com-ponents. In this procedure, a tube of blood is placed in acentrifuge, a piece of equipment that spins the tube incircles at high speed. The force generated by the spin-ning causes the various elements in the bloodstream tosettle at different levels of the tube.\nThe lymphocytes are extracted from the tube and\ntreated with special dyes, or stains. Each stain isequipped with an antibody portion that adheres to a spe-cific type of lymphocyte, such as a B cell or a T cell. Thestains make the cells visible to an automated countingmachine, called a flow cytometer. Based on the number\nof times the machine detects a particular stain, it can cal-culate the number of the associated cell type. This proce-dure can also be used to classify T cells and B cells intotheir subtypes.\nPreparation\nIf possible, a person should avoid eating a heavy\nmeal within hours of the test or engaging in strenuousexercise for the 24 hours preceding the blood test.\nNormal results\nIn general, normal levels of white blood cells vary\nslightly by age and gender. Normal values are lower inchildren under the age of 15 and in young adults betweenthe ages of 20 and 30. After age 30, men have slightlyhigher levels of white blood cells than women.\nNormal adult levels of white blood cells are 4,500-\n11,000 cells per microliter of blood. Lymphocytesaccount for approximately 25-45% of the total whiteblood cell count; the normal range is 1,000-4,800 lym-phocytes per microliter of blood. Of the total lympho-cytes, 60-80% are T cells and approximately 15% are Bcells. (There are two other types of lymphocytes; naturalkiller and K-type; that constitute a minor proportion ofthe total lymphocyte numbers.)\nAbnormal results\nA higher-than-normal level of lymphocytes is called\nlymphocytosis. Lymphocytosis occurs if a person has aviral, bacterial, or other type of infection. It can alsooccur with certain blood disorders, such as leukemia.\nLower-than-normal levels of lymphocytes is called\nlymphopenia. Lymphopenia can be an indicator of cer-tain cancers, bone marrow failure, or immune systemdeficiency. Medical treatments, such as chemotherapy\nand radiation therapy , can also deplete the body’s sup-\nply of lymphocytes, as can exposure to poisonous sub-stances.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCorbett, Jane Vincent.

Many cases are probably noteven identified because the symptoms range fromextremely mild to those resembling severe flu. A fewpatients develop symptoms of meningitis . In some rare\ncases, the LCM viral infection can spread throughout thecentral nervous system, and may even be fatal.\nCauses and symptoms\nLCM is caused by an arenavirus, which is an RNA\nvirus and is a mild cousin in the family containing themuch more threatening arenaviruses that cause hemmor-rhagic fever . Humans acquire LCM virus from infected\nrodents by coming in contact with the animals or theirexcretions. Exposure to the virus is not as unlikely tooccur as it seems, because the viral hosts can be commonhouse mice and even pets, such as hamsters and chin-chillas.

The\nfirst (prodrome) stage can produce fever, chills, muscleaches, cough , and vomiting. In the second phase, charac-\nteristic meningitis symptoms of headache , stiff neck,\nlistlessness, and nausea and vomiting may occur. In\nadults, complications are rare and recovery may evenoccur before the second phase.\nThe virus is not spread from person to person,\nexcept through pregnancy . LCM virus is one of the few\nviruses that can cross the placenta from mother to childduring pregnancy and may be an underrecognized causeof congenital infection in newborns. Infection withcytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, or LCM virus can\nappear similar enough in infants to be confused whendiagnosed. In cases that have been recognized amonginfants, LCM viral infection has a high mortality rate(about one-third of the babies studied died).\nDiagnosis\nLCM can be distinguished from bacterial meningitis\nby the history of prodrome symptoms and the period oftime before meningitis symptoms begin, which is about15-21 days for LCM.\nTreatment\nNo antiviral agents exist for LCM virus.

Lym-phocytes are a specific type of white blood cell withimportant functions in the immune system.\nDescription\nLymphocytes normally account for 15-40% of all\nwhite cells in the bloodstream. They help to protect thebody from infections caused by viruses or fungi. Theyalso coordinate the activities of other cells in the immunesystem. In addition, lymphocytes fight cancer and devel-\nop into antibody-producing cells that neutralize the effectof foreign substances in the blood.\nLymphocytopenia is the result of abnormalities in the\nway lymphocytes are produced, make their way throughthe bloodstream, or are lost or destroyed. These condi-tions can result from congenital or drug-induced decreas-es in the body’s ability to recognize and attack invaders.\nCauses and symptoms\nLymphocytopenia has a wide range of possible causes:\n•AIDS and other viral, bacterial, and fungal infections\n• chronic failure of the right ventricle of the heart (This\nchamber of the heart pumps blood to the lungs.)\n• hodgkin’s disease and cancers of the lymphatic system\n• a leak or rupture in the thoracic duct (The thoracic duct\nremoves lymphatic fluid from the legs and abdomen.)\n• leukemia• side effects of prescription medications• malnutrition ( Diets that are low in protein and overall\ncalorie intake may cause lymphocytopenia.)\n• radiation therapy\n• high stress levels\n• trauma\nThe symptoms of lymphocytopenia vary. Lympho-\ncytes constitute only a fraction of the body’s white bloodcells, and a decline in their number may not produce anysymptoms. A patient who has lymphocytopenia mayhave symptoms of the condition responsible for thedepressed level of lymphocytes.\nDiagnosis\nLymphocytopenia is most often detected when blood\ntests are performed to diagnose other diseases.KEY TERMS\nB lymphocyte —A type of lymphocyte that circu-\nlates in the blood and lymph and produces anti-bodies when it encounters specific antigens. Blymphocytes are also called B cells.\nLymph —A clear yellowish fluid circulated by the\nlymphatic system.

When the number of B lym-phocytes is low, the patient may be treated with antibi-\notics , antifungal medications, antiviral agents, or a sub-\nstance containing a high concentration of antibodies(gamma globulin) to prevent infection.\nIt is not usually possible to restore normal lympho-\ncyte levels in AIDS patients. Drugs like AZT (azi-dothymidine, sold under the trade name Retrovir) canincrease the number of helper T cells, which help othercells wipe out disease organisms.\nPrognosis\nVery low levels of lymphocytes make patients vul-\nnerable to life-threatening infection. Researchers arestudying the effectiveness of transplanting bone marrowand other cells to restore normal lymphocyte levels.Gene therapy , which uses the body’s own resources or\nartificial substances to counter diseases or disorders, isalso being evaluated as a treatment for lymphocytopenia.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J.

Itaffects the lymph nodes and rectal area, as well as thegenitals, in humans. The name comes from two Latinwords that mean a swelling of granulation tissue in thelymph nodes resulting from sexual intercourse. Granula-tion tissue is tissue that forms during wound or ulcerhealing that has a rough or lumpy surface.\nDescription\nAlthough LGV is easily treated in its early stages, it\ncan produce serious complications in its later stages. LGVis most likely to occur among people living in tropical orsubtropical countries and among military personnel ortourists in countries or large cities with high rates of thedisease. Prostitutes play a major role in carrying and trans-mitting LGV , as was documented during an outbreak inFlorida in the late 1980s. There are about 1,000 document-ed cases of LGV in the United States in an average year.\nCauses and symptoms\nLGV is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , a globe-\nshaped parasitic organism that reproduces only inside ofliving cells. C. trachomatis has 17 subtypes and is\nresponsible for a wide range of infections in both menand women; however, only subtypes L1, L2, and L3cause lymphogranuloma venereum. The parasite has atwo-part lifecycle. In the first stage, it is inert and cansurvive outside of cells. In its second stage, it lacks acell wall and actively reproduces after gaining entry to acell. As the chlamydia organism reproduces inside thecell, it pushes the nucleus aside and forms an inclusionthat can be identified with tissue staining. LGV differsfrom other diseases caused by C. trachomatis in that it\naffects the body’s lymphatic system and not just themoist tissues of the genital region. In humans, thechlamydia organism is transmitted through vaginal oranal intercourse, oral sex, or contact with fluid fromopen ulcers or infected tissues.\nLymphogranuloma venereum has three stages. In its\nprimary stage, the disease is more likely to be detectedin men; it may go unnoticed in women. After an incuba-tion period of four to 30 days, a small painless ulcer orblister develops in the genital area. Second-stage LGVdevelops between one and six weeks later. In this stage,the infection spreads to the lymphatic system, formingbuboes (swellings) in the lymph nodes of the groin area.The buboes often merge, soften, and rupture, formingsinuses and fistulas (hollow passages and ducts) thatcarry an infectious bloody discharge to the outside of thebody. Patients with second-stage LGV may also havefever , nausea, headaches, pains in their joints, skin\nrashes , and enlargement of the spleen or liver. Third-\nstage LGV , which is sometimes called anogenitorectalsyndrome, develops in about 25% of patients. In men,this stage is usually seen in homosexuals. Third-stageLGV is marked by rectal pain ,constipation , a dis-\ncharge containing pus or bloody mucus, and the devel-opment of strictures (narrowing or tightening of a bodypassage) in the rectum or vagina.\nLGV can have a number of serious complications.\nC. trachomatis infections of any subtype are associated\nwith long-term fertility problems in women. Strictures inthe rectum can completely close off the lower bowel,producing eventual rupture of the bowel and inflamma-tion of the abdominal cavity. The patient can developchronic abscesses or fistulae in the anal area or in thevagina in women. Long-term blockages in the lymphnodes can produce elephantiasis , a condition in which\nthe patient’s upper legs and groin area become greatlyenlarged. Patients with chronic LGV infection have ahigher risk of developing cancer in the inflamed areas.\nChronic LGV can be reactivated in patients who\nbecome infected with the AIDS virus. These patients\ndevelop open ulcers in the groin that are difficult to treat.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2071Lymphogranuloma venereum\nThis man suffers from lymphogranuloma venereum, a vene-\nreal disease that is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia tra-\nchomatis. (Photograph by Milton Reisch, M.D., Corbis Images.\nReproduced by permission.)Diagnosis\nThe diagnosis of LGV is usually made on the basis of\nthe patient’s history, careful examination of the genitalarea and lymph nodes, and blood tests or cultures to con-firm the diagnosis. In the early stages of the disease, thedoctor will need to distinguish between LGV and suchother STDs as syphilis and herpes. If the patient has devel-\noped buboes, the doctor will need to rule out tuberculosis ,\ncat-scratch disease , bubonic plague , or tularemia (a dis-\nease similar to plague that is carried by rabbits and squir-rels). If the patient has developed rectal strictures, the doc-tor will need to rule out tumors or colitis.\nThere are several blood tests that can be used to con-\nfirm the diagnosis of LGV . The most commonly used arethe complement fixation (CF) test and the microimmuno-fluorescence (micro-IF) tests. Although the micro-IF testis considered more sensitive than the CF test, it is lesswidely available. An antibody titer (concentration) of 1:64or greater on the CF test or 1:512 or greater on the micro-IF test is needed to make the diagnosis of LGV . In somecases, the diagnosis can be made from culturing C. tra-\nchomatis taken from samples of tissue fluid from ulcers or\nbuboes, or from a tissue sample from the patient’s rectum.\nTreatment\nLGV is treated with oral antibiotics , usually tetracy-\ncline or doxycycline for 10-20 days, or erythromycin ortrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole for 14 days. Pregnantwomen are usually treated with erythromycin rather thanthe tetracyclines , because this class of medications can\nharm the fetus.\nPatients who have developed second- and third-stage\ncomplications may need surgical treatment. The doctorcan treat buboes by withdrawing fluid from them througha hollow needle into a suction syringe. This procedure iscalled aspiration. Fistulas and abscesses also can betreated surgically. Patients who develop elephantiasis areusually treated by plastic surgeons. Patients with rectalstrictures may need surgery to prevent bowel obstructionand rupture into the abdomen.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery for most patients is\ngood, with the exception of AIDS patients. Prompt treat-ment of the early stages of LGV is essential to preventtransmission of the disease as well as fertility problemsand other serious complications of the later stages.\nPrevention\nPrevention of lymphogranuloma venereum has four\nimportant aspects:KEY TERMS\nAnogenitorectal syndrome —Another name for\nthird-stage LGV.\nAspiration —A procedure in which pus or other\nfluid is removed from a body cavity through a hol-low needle connected to a syringe.\nBubo —An inflamed swelling inside a lymph node,\ncharacteristic of second-stage LGV.\nElephantiasis —Abnormal enlargement of the legs\nand groin area caused by blockage of the lymphat-ic system, as a complication of LGV.\nFistula —A passageway formed by a disease or\ninjury that drains fluid from an infected area to theoutside or to other parts of the body.\nLymph —A clear yellowish fluid that circulates\nthroughout the body, carrying white blood cellsand fats.

    "content": "Lysergic acid diethylamide\nDefinition\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also known as\n“acid,” belongs to a class of drugs known as hallucino-gens, which distort perceptions of reality. LSD is themost potent mood- and perception-altering drug known:doses as small as 30 micrograms can produce effectslasting six to 12 hours.\nPurpose\nIn the United States, LSD has no accepted medical\nuse and its manufacture is illegal.\nDescription\nLSD is produced synthetically from a fungus that\ngrows on rye grass. This odorless, colorless, and slightlybitter-tasting chemical is generally ingested orally andabsorbed from the gastrointestinal system. Manufactur-ers commonly distribute LSD in small squares ofabsorbent paper soaked with the drug, which users chewand swallow. Use of LSD and other hallucinogens bysecondary school students has decreased since 1998, buthas increased among older teens and young adultsattending dance clubs and all-night raves, according tothe National Institute on Drug Abuse.\nLSD alters perceptions by disrupting the action of\nthe neurotransmitter serotonin, although precisely how itdoes this is unclear. Studies suggest LSD acts on certaingroups of serotonin receptors, and that its effects aremost prominent in two brain regions: the cerebral cortexand the locus ceruleus. The cerebral cortex is involved inmood and perception, and the locus ceruleus receivessensory signals from all areas of the body. Natural hallu-cinogens resembling LSD, such as mescaline and psilo-cybin, have been used in social and religious rituals forthousands of years.\nAfter its discovery in 1938, LSD was used experi-\nmentally to treat neuroses, narcotic addiction ,autism ,\nalcoholism , and terminally ill cancer patients, and to\nstudy the mechanisms of psychotic diseases like schizo-\nphrenia . Nearly 30 years after its discovery, manufac-\nture, possession, sale, and use of LSD was restricted inthe United States under the Drug Abuse Control Amend-ment of 1965.\nLSD’s effects generally begin within an hour of\ntaking the drug and last for up to 12 hours. The drug isabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and circulatedthroughout the body and to the brain. It is metabolizedin the liver and excreted in the urine about 24 hoursafter ingestion. Physical effects of LSD may includeloss of appetite, sleeplessness, pupil dilation, dry\nmouth , salivation, palpitations , perspiration, nausea,\ndizziness , blurred vision, and anxiety , as well as\nincreased body temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure,and blood sugar.\nThe major effects of LSD are emotional and sensory.\nEmotions may shift instantaneously from euphoria toconfusion and despair, and users may feel as if they areexperiencing several emotions simultaneously. Colors,smells, and sounds may be highly intensified, and timemay appear to move very slowly. Sensory perceptionsmay blend in a phenomenon known as synesthesia, inwhich a person sees sounds, or smells colors, for exam-ple. Users may have out-of-body sensations, or may per-ceive their body has changed shape or merged withanother person or object.\nPrecautions\nUnlike cocaine , amphetamines, heroin, alcohol, and\nnicotine, LSD is not considered addictive, but it is con-sidered dangerous; users are at risk for several short- andlong-term side effects. LSD’s effects are unpredictableand may vary with the amount ingested and the user’spersonality, mood, expectations, and surroundings. Usersmay experience enjoyable sensations on some “trips,”and terrifying feelings of anxiety and despair on others.Most LSD-related deaths stem not from the LSD’s physi-cal effects on the body, but from the panicked reactionsensuing from intense LSD-triggered illusions.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2073Lysergic acid diethylamideSide Effects\nTwo long-term effects are associated with LSD use:\npsychosis , and hallucinogen persisting perception disor-\nder (HPPD), also known as “flashbacks.” The exact caus-es of these effects, including the mechanism by whichLSD may cause them, is unknown. Chronic hallucinogenusers or individuals with underlying personality prob-lems are most vulnerable to these effects, but individualswith no history of psychological disorders have alsoexperienced them. LSD-induced psychosis may includedramatic mood swings, loss of cognitive and communi-cation skills, and hallucinations . Flashbacks generally\ninvolve seeing bright flashes, or halos or trails attachedto moving objects after the LSD “trip” has ended. Flash-backs can last a few seconds or even several hours.KEY TERMS\nCerebral cortex —Brain region responsible for rea-\nsoning, mood, and perception.\nHallucinogen —A drug that distorts sensory per-\nceptions and disturbs emotion, judgment, andmemory.\nHallucinogen persisting perception disorder\n(HPPD) —The recurrence of LSD effects after the\ndrug experience has ended.\nLocus ceruleus —Brain region that processes sen-\nsory signals from all areas of the body.\nNeurotransmitter —Chemical compound in the\nbrain that transmits signals from one nerve cell toanother.\nSerotonin —A neurotransmitter that modulates the\nactions of other neurotransmitters in the brain.According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network\n(DAWN), the number of LSD-related hospital emergen-cies is low compared to those related to cocaine, heroin,marijuana, methamphetamine, and other illicit drugs.\nOne reason for this trend may be that LSD currently soldon the black market is less potent than in the past. LSDdose strengths tend to range from 20 to 80 microgramstoday, compared to 100 to 200 micrograms reported dur-ing the 1960s and early 1970s.\nInteractions\nLSD flashbacks can be spurred by use of drugs such\nas marijuana. Preliminary evidence suggests serotoninreuptake inhibitors like Prozac and Zoloft may also exac-erbate the LSD flashback syndrome.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nAghajanian, G. K. and G. J.

This disorder leads to irreversibleloss of central vision, although peripheral vision isretained. In the early stages, vision may be gray, hazy, ordistorted.\nDescription\nMacular degeneration is the most common cause of\nlegal blindness in people over 60, and accounts forapproximately 11.7% of blindness in the United States.About 28% of the population over age 74 is affected bythis disease.\nAge-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the\nmost common form of macular degeneration. It is alsoknown as age-related maculopathy (ARM), aged maculardegeneration, and senile macular degeneration. Approxi-mately 10 million Americans have some vision loss thatis due to ARMD.\nARMD is subdivided into a dry (atrophic) and a wet\n(exudative) form. The dry form is more common andaccounts for 70-90% of cases of ARMD. It progressesmore slowly than the wet form and vision loss is lesssevere. In the dry form, the macula thins over time as partof the aging process and the pigmented retinal epitheli-\num (a dark-colored cell layer at the back of the eye) isgradually lost. Words may appear blurred or hazy andcolors may appear dim or gray.\nIn the wet form of ARMD, new blood vessels grow\nunderneath the retina and distort the retina. These bloodvessels can leak, causing scar tissue to form on the retina.The wet form may cause visual distortion and makestraight lines appear wavy. A central blind spot develops.The wet type progresses more rapidly and vision loss ismore pronounced. Treatments are available for some, butnot most, cases of the wet form.\nOther less common forms of macular degeneration\ninclude:\n• Cystoid macular degeneration. Loss of vision in the\nmacula due to fluid-filled areas (cysts) in the macularregion. This may be a result of other disorders, such asaging, inflammation, or high myopia.\n• Diabetic macular degeneration. Deterioration of the\nmacula due to diabetes.\n• Senile disciform degeneration (also known as Kuhnt-\nJunius macular degeneration). A specific and severetype of the wet form of ARMD that involves leakingblood vessels (hemorrhaging) in the macular region. Itusually occurs in people over 40 years old.\nCauses and symptoms\nAge-related macular degeneration is part of the\naging process. There may be a hereditary component.Having a family member with ARMD increases a per-son’s risk for developing it. There is a slightly higherincidence in females. Whites and Asians are more sus-ceptible to developing ARMD than blacks, in whom thedisorder is rare.\nARMD is thought to be caused by hardening and\nblocking of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) in the bloodvessels supplying the retina. Some of the same thingsthat are bad for the heart are thought to contribute to thedevelopment of macular degeneration. These risk factorsinclude smoking and a diet that is rich in saturated fat.\nSmokers have a risk of developing ARMD that is approx-imately 2.4-3 times that of non-smokers. Smokingincreases the risk of developing wet-type ARMD, andmay increases the risk of developing dry-type as well.Dietary fat also increase the risk. In one study of older(age 45-84) Americans, signs of early ARMD were 80%more common in the group who ate the most saturatedfat compared to those who ate the least. Low consump-M\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2075tion of antioxidants, such as foods rich in vitamin A, is\nassociated with a higher risk for developing ARMD.Consumption of moderate amounts of red wine andfoods rich in vitamin A is associated with a lower risk. Itis generally believed that exposure to ultraviolet (UV)light may contribute to disease development, but this hasnot been proven.\nThe main symptom of macular degeneration is a\nchange in central vision. The patient may notice blurredcentral vision or a blank spot on the page when reading.The patient may notice visual distortion such as bendingof straight lines. Images may appear smaller. Somepatients notice a change in color perception and someexperience abnormal light sensations. These symptomsmay come on suddenly and become progressively moretroublesome. Sudden onset of symptoms, particularlyvision distortion, is an indication for immediate evalua-tion by an ophthalmologist.\nDiagnosis\nTo make the diagnosis of macular degeneration, the\ndoctor dilates the pupil with eye drops and examines theinterior of the eye, looking at the retina for the presence ofyellow bumps called drusen and for gross changes in themacula such as thinning. The doctor also administers a\nvisual field test, looking for blank spots in the centralvision. The doctor may call for fluorescein angiography\n(intravenous injection of fluorescent dye followed by visu-al examination and photography of the back of the eye) todetermine if blood vessels in the retina are leaking.\nA central visual field test called an Amsler grid is\nusually given to patients who are suspected of havingARMD. It is a grid printed on a sheet of paper (so it iseasy to take home). When looking at a central dot on thepage, the patient should call the doctor right away if anyof the lines appear to be wavy or missing. This may be anindication of fluid and the onset of wet ARMD. Patientsmay also be asked to come in for more frequent checkups.\nTreatment\nWhile loss of vision cannot be reversed, early detec-\ntion is important because treatments are available thatmay halt or slow the progression of the wet form ofARMD. Treatment for the dry form is not available as of1998, but cell transplantation studies are under study.\nIn wet-type ARMD and in senile disciform macular\ndegeneration, new capillaries grow in the macular regionand leak. This leaking of blood and fluid causes a portionof the retina to detach. Blood vessel growth, called neo-vascularization, can be treated with laser photocoagula-tion in some cases, depending upon the location andextent of the growth. Argon or krypton lasers can destroythe new tissue and flatten the retina. This treatment iseffective in about half the cases but results may be tem-porary. A concern with laser therapy is that the laser alsodestroys the photoreceptors in the treated area. If theblood vessels have grown into the fovea (a region of themacula responsible for fine vision), treatment may not bepossible. Because capillaries can grow very quickly, thisform of macular degeneration should be handled as anemergency and treated quickly. Patients who are experi-encing visual distortion should seek help immediately.\nAnother form of treatment for the wet form of\nARMD is radiation therapy with either x rays or a pro-\nton beam. Blood vessels that are proliferating (growing)are sensitive to treatment with low doses of ionizing radi-ation. Nerve cells in the retina are not growing and areinsensitive, so they are not harmed by this treatment.External beam radiation treatment has shown promisingresults at slowing progression in limited, early trials. Analternative treatment is internal beam radiation therapy.For this treatment, the patient is given a local anestheticand an applicator containing strontium 90 is inserted intothe affected eye. This brief and localized radiation thera-py prevents the growth of blood vessels.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2076Macular degeneration\nA slit-lamp view showing macular degeneration of the eye.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)Other therapies that are under study include treat-\nment with alpha-interferon, thalidomide, and other drugsthat slow the growth of blood vessels. Subretinal surgeryalso has shown promise in rapid-onset cases of wetARMD. This surgery carries the risk of retinal detach-\nment , hemorrhage, and acceleration of cataract forma-\ntion. Other experimental treatments include photody-namic therapy (PDT). For this treatment, a photosensitiz-ing dye is injected, followed by irradiation of the area ofnew blood vessel growth with a special, low-intensitydiode laser. This treatment damages the cells in the bloodvessel walls and causes them to stop growing.\nA controversial treatment called rheotherapy involves\npumping the patient’s blood through a device that removessome proteins and fats. As of 1998, this had not beenproven to be safe or effective.\nAlternative treatment\nConsumption of a diet rich in antioxidants (beta\ncarotene and the mixed carotenoids that are precursors ofvitamin A, vitamins C and E, selenium, and zinc), or taking\nantioxidant nutritional supplements, may help prevent mac-ular degeneration, particularly if started early in life. Gooddietary sources of antioxidants include citrus fruits, cauli-flower, broccoli, nuts, seeds, orange and yellow vegetables,cherries, blackberries, and blueberries. Research has shownthat nutritional therapy can prevent ARMD or slow its pro-gression once established. Some doctors recommend takingbeta carotene and zinc as a precautionary measure. Somevitamins are marketed specifically for the eyes.\nPrognosis\nThe dry form of ARMD is self-limiting and eventu-\nally stabilizes. The loss of vision is permanent. Thevision of patients with the wet form of ARMD often sta-bilizes or improves even without treatment, at least tem-porarily. However, after a few years, patients with thewet form of ARMD are usually left with only coarseperipheral vision remaining.\nMany patients with macular degeneration lose their\ncentral vision permanently and may become legallyblind. However, macular degeneration rarely causes totalloss of vision. Peripheral vision is retained. The patientcan compensate, to some extent, for the loss of centralvision, even though macular degeneration may renderthem legally blind. Improved lighting and special low-vision aids may help even if sharpness of vision (visualacuity) is poor. Vision aids include special magnifiersthat allow the patient to read and telescopic aids for long-distance vision. The use of these visual aids plus theretained peripheral vision usually allow the patient toremain independent.

The retinasends the images to the brain via the optic nerve.\nson will enable a patient to obtain special services and\nconsiderations.\nPrevention\nAvoiding the risk factors for macular degeneration\nmay help prevent it. This includes avoiding tobaccosmoke and eating a diet low in saturated fat. Some otherbehaviors that may help reduce the risk of wet-typeARMD are eating a diet rich in green, leafy vegetablesand yellow vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes,and winter squash; drinking moderate amounts of alco-hol, such as one or two glasses of red wine a day; andtaking an antioxidant vitamin supplement, especially vit-amin A. Some vitamins may be toxic in large doses, sopatients should speak with their doctors. Vitamins C andE have not been shown to reduce risk, nor did seleniumin one large study. The use of zinc is controversial: somestudies showed a benefit, others showed no benefit, andone actually showed an increased risk of ARMD withincreased levels of zinc in the blood. Some doctors sug-gest that wearing UV-blocking sunglasses reduces risk.Use of estrogen in postmenopausal women is associatedwith a lower risk of developing ARMD.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCaird, F.

    "content": "Magnesium imbalance\nDefinition\nA mineral found in the fluid that surrounds cells,\nmagnesium (Mg) is an essential component of more than300 enzymes that regulate many body functions. Imbal-ances occur when the blood contains more or less mag-nesium than it should.\nDescription\nMagnesium is necessary for the formation and func-\ntioning of healthy bones, teeth, muscles, and nerves. Itconverts food into energy, builds proteins, and is instru-mental in maintaining adequate levels of calcium in theblood. Magnesium helps prevent cardiovascular diseaseand irregular heartbeat, reduces the risk of bone loss(osteoporosis ), and increases an individual’s chance of\nsurviving a heart attack . It may also help prevent stroke\nand lessen the effects of existing osteoporosis.Fish, dairy products, leafy green vegetables, legumes,\nnuts, seeds, and grains are especially good sources of mag-nesium, but varying amounts of this mineral are found inall foods. Some is stored in the kidneys, and excessamounts are excreted in the urine or stools.\nMagnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) or excess\n(hypermagnesemia) is rare, but either condition can beserious.\nCauses and symptoms\nHypomagnesemia\nMagnesium deficiency most often occurs in people\nwho have been fed intravenously for a long time, whosediet doesn’t contain enough magnesium, or who areunable to absorb and excrete the mineral properly.\nSecreting too much aldosterone (the hormone that\nregulates the body’s salt-fluid balance), ADH (a hormonethat inhibits urine production), or thyroid hormone cancause hypomagnesemia.\nOther factors associated with hypomagnesemia\ninclude:\n• loss of body fluids as a result of stomach suctioning or\nchronic diarrhea\n• cisplatin (a chemotherapy drug)\n• long-term diuretic therapy• hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in\nthe blood)\n• diabetic acidosis (a condition in which the body’s tis-\nsues have a higher-than-normal acid content)\n• complications of bowel surgery• chronic alcoholism\n• malnutrition• starvation\n• severe dehydration\nPeople who have hypomagnesemia usually experi-\nence loss of weight and appetite, bloating, and musclepain , and they pass stools that have a high fat content.\nAlso, they may be listless, disoriented, confused, andvery irritable. Other symptoms of hypomagnesemia are:\n• nausea\n• vomiting• muscle weakness• tremor• irregular heart beat\n• delusions and hallucinations\n• leg and foot cramps\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2078Magnesium imbalance• muscle twitches\n• changes in blood pressure\nSevere magnesium deficiency can cause seizures,\nespecially in children.\nNeonatal hypomagnesemia can occur in premature\nbabies and in infants who have genetic parathyroid disor-ders or who have had blood transfusions. This conditionalso occurs in babies born to magnesium-deficient moth-ers or to women who have:\n• diabetes mellitus.\n• hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands)• toxemia (a pregnancy-related condition characterized\nby high blood pressure and fluid retention)\nHypermagnesemia\nHypermagnesemia is most common in patients whose\nkidneys cannot excrete the magnesium they derive fromfood or take as medication. This condition can also devel-op in patients who take magnesium salts, or in healthypeople who use large quantities of magnesium-containingantacids ,laxatives , or analgesics (pain relievers).\nMagnesium poisoning can cause severe diarrhea in\nyoung people, and mask the symptoms of other illnesses.Very high overdoses can lead to coma . The risk of com-\nplications of magnesium poisoning is greatest for:\n• elderly people with inefficient kidney function• patients with kidney problems or intestinal disorders• people who use antihistamines ,muscle relaxants ,o r\nnarcotics\nSevere dehydration or an overdose of supplements\ntaken to counteract hypomagnesemia can also cause thiscondition.\nPeople who have hypermagnesemia may feel\nflushed and drowsy, perspire heavily, and have diarrhea.Breathing becomes shallow, reflexes diminish, and thepatient becomes unresponsive. Muscle weakness andhallucinations are common. The patient’s heart beatslows dramatically and blood pressure plummets.Extreme toxicity, which can lead to coma and cardiacarrest, can be fatal.\nDiagnosis\nBlood tests are used to measure magnesium levels.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to identify and correct the\ncause of the imbalance. Oral magnesium supplements orKEY TERMS\nHypermagnesemia —An abnormally high concen-\ntration of magnesium in the blood.\nHypomagnesemia —An abnormally low concen-\ntration of magnesium in the blood.\ninjections are usually prescribed to correct mild magne-\nsium deficiency. If the deficiency is more severe or doesnot respond to treatment, magnesium sulfate or magne-sium chloride may be administered intravenously.\nDoctors usually prescribe diuretics (urine-produc-\ning drugs) for patients with hypermagnesemia and advisethem to drink more fluids to flush the excess mineralfrom the body. Patients whose magnesium levels areextremely high may need mechanical support to breatheand to circulate blood throughout their bodies.\nIntravenously administered calcium gluconate\nmay reverse damage caused by excess magnesium.Intravenous furosemide (Lasix) or ethacrynic acid(Edecrin) can increase magnesium excretion in patientswho get enough fluids and whose kidneys are function-ing properly.\nIn an emergency, dialysis can provide temporary\nrelief for patients whose kidney function is poor or whoare unable to excrete excess minerals .\nPrognosis\nBecause imbalances may recur if the underlying con-\ndition is not eliminated, monitoring of magnesium levelsshould continue after treatment has been completed.\nPrevention\nMost people consume adequate amounts of magne-\nsium in the food they eat.

    "title": "Magnetic field therapy",
    "content": "Magnetic field therapy\nDefinition\nMagnetic therapy is the use of magnets to relieve\npain in various areas of the body.\nPurpose\nSome of the benefits that magnetic therapy claims to\nprovide include:\n• pain relief• reduction of swelling\n• improved tissue alkalinization\n• more restful sleep• increased tissue oxygenation• relief of stress\n• increased levels of cellular oxygen\n• improved blood circulation• anti-infective activity\nDescription\nOrigins\nMagnetic therapy dates as far back as the ancient\nEgyptians. Magnets have long been believed to havehealing powers associated with muscle pain and stiff-ness. Chinese healers as early as 200 \nB.C. were said to\nuse magnetic lodestones on the body to correct unhealthyimbalances in the flow of qi,or energy. The ancient Chi-\nnese medical text known as The Yellow Emperor’s Canon\nof Internal Medicine describes this procedure. The\nVedas , or ancient Hindu scriptures, also mention the\ntreatment of diseases with lodestones. The word “lode-stone” or leading stone, came from the use of thesestones as compasses. The word “magnet” probably stemsfrom the Greek Magnes lithos , or “stone from Magne-\nsia,” a region of Greece rich in magnetic stones. TheGreek phrase later became magneta in Latin.\nSir William Gilbert’s 1600 treatise, De Magnete ,\nwas the first scholarly attempt to explain the nature ofmagnetism and how it differed from the attractive forceof static electricity. Gilbert allegedly used magnets torelieve the arthritic pains of Queen Elizabeth I. Contem-porary American interest in magnetic therapy began inthe 1990s, as several professional golfers and footballplayers offered testimony that the devices seemed to curetheir nagging aches and injuries.\nMany centuries ago, the earth was surrounded by a\nmuch stronger magnetic field than it is today. Over thepast 155 years, scientists have been studying the declineof this magnetic field and the effects it has had on humanhealth. When the first cosmonauts and astronauts weregoing into space, physicians noted that they experiencedbone calcium loss and muscle cramps when they wereout of the Earth’s magnetic field for any extended periodof time. After this discovery was made, artifical magneticfields were placed in the space capsules.\nThere are two theories that are used to explain mag-\nnetic therapy. One theory maintains that magnets pro-duce a slight electrical current. When magnets areapplied to a painful area of the body, the nerves in thatarea are stimulated, thus releasing the body’s naturalpainkillers. The other theory maintains that when mag-nets are applied to a painful area of the body, all the cellsin that area react to increase blood circulation, ionexchange, and oxygen flow to the area. Magnetic fieldsattract and repel charged particles in the bloodstream,increasing blood flow and producing heat. Increasedoxygen in the tissues and blood stream is thought tomake a considerable difference in the speed of healing.\nPreparations\nThere are no special preparations for using magnetic\ntherapy other than purchasing a product that is specificfor the painful area being treated. Products available in arange of prices include necklaces and bracelets; knee,back, shoulder and wrist braces; mattress pads; gloves;shoe inserts; and more.\nPrecautions\nThe primary precaution involved with magnetic\ntherapy is to recognize the expense of this therapy. Mag-nets have become big business; they can be found inmail-order catalogs and stores ranging from upscaledepartment stores to specialty stores. As is the case withmany popular self-administered therapies, many far-fetched claims are being made about the effectiveness of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2080Magnetic field therapymagnetic therapy. Consumers should adopt a “let the\nbuyer beware” approach to magnetic therapy. Personswho are interested in this form of treatment should tryout a small, inexpensive item to see if it works for thembefore investing in the more expensive products.\nSide effects\nThere are very few side effects from using magnetic\ntherapy. Generally, patients using this therapy find that iteither works for them or it does not. Patients using tran-scranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of depres-sion reported mild headache as their only side effect.\nResearch and general acceptance\nMagnetic therapy is becoming more and more wide-\nly accepted as an alternative method of pain relief. Sincethe late 1950s, hundreds of studies have demonstratedthe effectiveness of magnetic therapy. In 1997, a group ofphysicians at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,Texas studied the use of magnetic therapy in 50 patientswho had developed polio earlier in life. These patients\nhad muscle and joint pain that standard treatments failedto manage. In this study, 29 of the patients wore a magnettaped over a trouble spot, and 21 others wore a nonmag-netic device. Neither the researchers nor the patientswere told which treatment they were receiving (magneticor nonmagnetic). As is the case with most studies involv-ing a placebo, some of the patients responded to the non-magnetic therapy, but 75% of those using the magnetictherapy reported feeling much better.\nIn another study at New York Medical College in\nValhalla, New York, a neurologist tested magnetic thera-py on a group of 19 men and women complaining ofmoderate to severe burning, tingling, or numbness intheir feet. Their problems were caused by diabetes orother conditions present such as alcoholism . This group\nof patients wore a magnetic insole inside one of theirsocks or shoes for 24 hours a day over a two-month peri-od, except while bathing. They wore a nonmagneticinsert in their other sock or shoe. Then for two monthsthey wore magnetic inserts on both feet. By the end ofthe study, nine out of ten of the diabetic patients reportedrelief, while only three of nine nondiabetic patientsreported relief. The neurologist in charge of the studybelieves that this study opens the door to additionalresearch into magnetic therapy for diabetic patients. Heplans a larger follow-up study in the near future.\nAs of 2000, a federally funded study is underway at\nthe University of Virginia. This study is evaluating theeffectiveness of magnetic mattress pads in easing themuscle pain, stiffness and fatigue associated with\nfibromyalgia .KEY TERMS\nFibromyalgia —A chronic syndrome characterized\nby fatigue, widespread muscular pain, and pain atspecific points on the body.\nLodestone —A variety of magnetite that possesses\nmagnetic polarity.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation —A procedure\nused to treat patients with depression.\nMagnetic therapy is also being studied in the treat-\nment of depression in patients with bipolar disorder .

    "title": "Magnetic resonance imaging",
    "content": "Magnetic resonance imaging\nDefinition\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the newest,\nand perhaps most versatile, medical imaging technologyavailable. Doctors can get highly refined images of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2081Magnetic resonance imagingbody’s interior without surgery, using MRI. By using\nstrong magnets and pulses of radio waves to manipulatethe natural magnetic properties in the body, this tech-nique makes better images of organs and soft tissues thanthose of other scanning technologies. MRI is particularlyuseful for imaging the brain and spine, as well as the softtissues of joints and the interior structure of bones. Theentire body is visible to the technique, which poses fewknown health risks.\nPurpose\nMRI was developed in the 1980s. The latest addi-\ntions to MRI technology are angiography (MRA) and\nspectroscopy (MRS). MRA was developed to studyblood flow, while MRS can identify the chemical compo-sition of diseased tissue and produce color images ofbrain function. The many advantages of MRI include:\n• Detail. MRI creates precise images of the body based on\nthe varying proportions of magnetic elements in differ-ent tissues. Very minor fluctuations in chemical compo-sition can be determined. MRI images have greater nat-ural contrast than standard x rays, computed tomogra-phy scan (CT scan), or ultrasound, all of which dependon the differing physical properties of tissues. This sen-sitivity lets MRI distinguish fine variations in tissuesdeep within the body. It also is particularly useful forspotting and distinguishing diseased tissues (tumors andother lesions) early in their development. Often, doctorsprescribe an MRI scan to more fully investigate earlierfindings of the other imaging techniques.\n• Scope. The entire body can be scanned, from head to\ntoe and from the skin to the deepest recesses of thebrain. Moreover, MRI scans are not obstructed by bone,gas, or body waste, which can hinder other imagingtechniques. (Although the scans can be degraded bymotion such as breathing, heartbeat, and normal bowelactivity.) The MRI process produces cross-sectionalimages of the body that are as sharp in the middle as onthe edges, even of the brain through the skull. A closeseries of these two-dimensional images can provide athree-dimensional view of a targeted area.\n• Safety. MRI does not depend on potentially harmful\nionizing radiation, as do standard x-ray and CT scans.There are no known risks specific to the procedure,other than for people who might have metal objects intheir bodies.\nGiven all the advantages, doctors would undoubted-\nly prescribe MRI as frequently as ultrasound scanning,but the MRI process is complex and costly. The processrequires large, expensive, and complicated equipment; ahighly trained operator; and a doctor specializing in radi-ology. Generally, MRI is prescribed only when serioussymptoms and/or negative results from other tests indi-\ncate a need. Many times another test is appropriate forthe type of diagnosis needed.\nDoctors may prescribe an MRI scan of different\nareas of the body.\n• Brain and head. MRI technology was developed because\nof the need for brain imaging. It is one of the few imag-ing tools that can see through bone (the skull) and deliverhigh quality pictures of the brain’s delicate soft tissuestructures. MRI may be needed for patients with symp-toms of a brain tumor ,stroke , or infection (like menin-\ngitis). MRI also may be needed when cognitive and/or\npsychological symptoms suggest brain disease (likeAlzheimer’s or Huntington’s diseases, or multiple scle-\nrosis ), or when developmental retardation suggests a\nbirth defect. MRI can also provide pictures of the sinusesand other areas of the head beneath the face.\n• Spine. Spinal problems can create a host of seemingly\nunrelated symptoms. MRI is particularly useful foridentifying and evaluating degenerated or herniatedspinal discs. It can also be used to determine the condi-tion of nerve tissue within the spinal cord.\n• Joint. MRI scanning is most commonly used to diag-\nnose and assess joint problems. MRI can provide clearimages of the bone, cartilage, ligament, and tendon thatcomprise a joint. MRI can be used to diagnose jointinjuries due to sports, advancing age, or arthritis. MRIcan also be used to diagnose shoulder problems, like atorn rotator cuff. MRI can also detect the presence of anotherwise hidden tumor or infection in a joint, and canbe used to diagnose the nature of developmental jointabnormalities in children.\n• Skeleton. The properties of MRI that allow it to see\nthough the skull also allow it to view the inside ofbones. It can be used to detect bone cancer , inspect the\nmarrow for leukemia and other diseases, assess boneloss ( osteoporosis ), and examine complex fractures .\n• The rest of the body. While CT and ultrasound satisfy\nmost chest, abdominal, and general body imagingneeds, MRI may be needed in certain circumstances toprovide better pictures or when repeated scanning isrequired. The progress of some therapies, like liver\ncancer therapy, needs to be monitored, and the effect of\nrepeated x-ray exposure is a concern.\nPrecautions\nMRI scanning should not be used when there is the\npotential for an interaction between the strong MRI mag-net and metal objects that might be imbedded in apatient’s body. The force of magnetic attraction on cer-tain types of metal objects (including surgical steel)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2082Magnetic resonance imagingcould move them within the body and cause serious\ninjury. Metal may be imbedded in a person’s body forseveral reasons.\n• Medical. People with implanted cardiac pacemakers ,\nmetal aneurysm clips, or who have had broken bonesrepaired with metal pins, screws, rods, or plates musttell their radiologist prior to having an MRI scan. Insome cases (like a metal rod in a reconstructed leg) thedifficulty may be overcome.\n• Injury. Patients must tell their doctors if they have bul-\nlet fragments or other metal pieces in their body fromold wounds . The suspected presence of metal, whether\nfrom an old or recent wound, should be confirmedbefore scanning.\n• Occupational. People with significant work exposure to\nmetal particles (working with a metal grinder, for exam-ple) should discuss this with their doctor and radiologist.The patient may need prescan testing—usually a single,regular x ray of the eyes to see if any metal is present.\nChemical agents designed to improve the picture\nand/or allow for the imaging of blood or other fluid flowduring MRA may be injected. In rare cases, patients maybe allergic to or intolerant of these agents, and thesepatients should not receive them. If these chemicalagents are to be used, patients should discuss any con-cerns they have with their doctor and radiologist.\nThe potential side effects of magnetic and electric\nfields on human health remain a source of debate. In par-ticular, the possible effects on an unborn baby are notwell known. Any woman who is, or may be, pregnantshould carefully discuss this issue with her doctor andradiologist before undergoing a scan.\nAs with all medical imaging techniques, obesity\ngreatly interferes with the quality of MRI.\nDescription\nIn essence, MRI produces a map of hydrogen distri-\nbution in the body. Hydrogen is the simplest elementknown, the most abundant in biological tissue, and onethat can be magnetized. It will align itself within a strongmagnetic field, like the needle of a compass. The earth’smagnetic field is not strong enough to keep a person’shydrogen atoms pointing in the same direction, but thesuperconducting magnet of an MRI machine can. Thiscomprises the “magnetic” part of MRI.\nOnce a patient’s hydrogen atoms have been aligned\nin the magnet, pulses of very specific radio wave fre-quencies are used to knock them back out of alignment.The hydrogen atoms alternately absorb and emit radiowave energy, vibrating back and forth between their rest-ing (magnetized) state and their agitated (radio pulse)\nstate. This comprises the “resonance” part of MRI.\nThe MRI equipment records the duration, strength,\nand source location of the signals emitted by the atoms asthey relax and translates the data into an image on a tele-vision monitor. The state of hydrogen in diseased tissuediffers from healthy tissue of the same type, making MRIparticularly good at identifying tumors and other lesions.In some cases, chemical agents such as gadolinium canbe injected to improve the contrast between healthy anddiseased tissue.\nA single MRI exposure produces a two-dimensional\nimage of a slice through the entire target area. A series ofthese image slices closely spaced (usually less than half aninch) makes a virtual three-dimensional view of the area.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is different\nfrom MRI because MRS uses a continuous band of radiowave frequencies to excite hydrogen atoms in a varietyof chemical compounds other than water. These com-pounds absorb and emit radio energy at characteristicfrequencies, or spectra, which can be used to identifythem. Generally, a color image is created by assigning acolor to each distinctive spectral emission. This compris-es the “spectroscopy” part of MRS. MRS is still experi-mental and is available in only a few research centers.\nDoctors primarily use MRS to study the brain and\ndisorders, like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease , brain\ntumors, and the effects of drugs on brain growth and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2083Magnetic resonance imaging\nMRI body scans of a man, woman, and child. (Simon Fraser,\nPhoto Researchers. Reproduced by permission.)metabolism. The technique is also useful in evaluating\nmetabolic disorders of the muscles and nervous system.\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is another\nvariation on standard MRI. MRA, like other types ofangiography, looks specifically at fluid flow within theblood (vascular) system, but does so without the injec-tion of dyes or radioactive tracers. Standard MRI cannotmake a good picture of flowing blood, but MRA usesspecific radio pulse sequences to capture usable signals.The technique is generally used in combination withMRI to obtain images that show both vascular structureand flow within the brain and head in cases of stroke, orwhen a blood clot or aneurysm is suspected.\nRegardless of the exact type of MRI planned, or area\nof the body targeted, the procedure involved is basicallythe same and occurs in a special MRI suite. The patientlies back on a narrow table and is made as comfortable aspossible. Transmitters are positioned on the body and thecushioned table that the patient is lying on moves into along tube that houses the magnet. The tube is as long asan average adult lying down, and the tube is narrow andopen at both ends. Once the area to be examined hasbeen properly positioned, a radio pulse is applied. Then atwo-dimensional image corresponding to one slicethrough the area is made. The table then moves a fractionof an inch and the next image is made. Each image expo-sure takes several seconds and the entire exam will lastanywhere from 30-90 minutes. During this time, thepatient is not allowed to move. If the patient moves dur-ing the scan, the picture will not be clear.\nDepending on the area to be imaged, the radio-wave\ntransmitters will be positioned in different locations.\n• For the head and neck, a helmet-like hat is worn.• For the spine, chest, and abdomen, the patient will be\nlying on the transmitters.\n• For the knee, shoulder, or other joint, the transmitters\nwill be applied directly to the joint.\nAdditional probes will monitor vital signs (like\npulse, respiration, etc.).\nThe process is very noisy and confining. The patient\nhears a thumping sound for the duration of the proce-dure. Since the procedure is noisy, music supplied viaearphones is often provided. Some patients get anxiousor panic because they are in the small, enclosed tube.This is why vital signs are monitored and the patient andmedical team can communicate between each other. Ifthe chest or abdomen are to be imaged, the patient willbe asked to hold his/her breath as each exposure is made.Other instructions may be given to the patient, as needed.In many cases, the entire examination will be performedby an MRI operator who is not a doctor. However, thesupervising radiologist should be available to consult as\nnecessary during the exam, and will view and interpretthe results sometime later.\nPreparation\nIn some cases (such as for MRI brain scanning or an\nMRA), a chemical designed to increase image contrastmay be given by the radiologist immediately before theexam. If a patient suffers from anxiety or claustrophobia,\ndrugs may be given to help the patient relax.\nThe patient must remove all metal objects (watches,\njewelry, eye glasses, hair clips, etc). Any magnetizedobjects (like credit and bank machine cards, audio tapes,etc.) should be kept far away from the MRI equipmentbecause they can be erased. The patient cannnot bring theirwallet or keys into the MRI machine. The patient may beasked to wear clothing without metal snaps, buckles, orzippers, unless a medical gown is worn during the proce-dure. The patient may be asked to remove any hair spray,hair gel, or cosmetics that may interfere with the scan.\nAftercare\nNo aftercare is necessary, unless the patient received\nmedication or had a reaction to a contrast agent. Normal-ly, patients can immediately return to their daily activi-ties. If the exam reveals a serious condition that requiresmore testing and/or treatment, appropriate informationand counseling will be needed.\nRisks\nMRI poses no known health risks to the patient and\nproduces no physical side effects. Again, the potentialeffects of MRI on an unborn baby are not well known.Any woman who is, or may be, pregnant, should careful-ly discuss this issue with her doctor and radiologistbefore undergoing a scan.\nNormal results\nA normal MRI, MRA, or MRS result is one that\nshows the patient’s physical condition to fall within nor-mal ranges for the target area scanned.\nAbnormal results\nGenerally, MRI is prescribed only when serious\nsymptoms and/or negative results from other tests indi-cate a need. There often exists strong evidence of a con-dition that the scan is designed to detect and assess.Thus, the results will often be abnormal, confirming theearlier diagnosis. At that point, further testing and appro-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2084Magnetic resonance imagingpriate medical treatment is needed. For example, if the\nMRI indicates the presence of a brain tumor, an MRSmay be prescribed to determine the type of tumor so thataggressive treatment can begin immediately without theneed for a surgical biopsy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nEdelman, Robert R., et al., eds.

    "title": "Malabsorption syndrome",
    "content": "Malabsorption syndrome\nDefinition\nMalabsorption syndrome is an alteration in the abili-\nty of the intestine to absorb nutrients adequately into thebloodstream.\nCauses and symptoms\nProtein, fats, and carbohydrates (macronutrients)\nnormally are absorbed in the small intestine; the small\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2085Malabsorption syndromebowel also abso rbs about 80% of the eight to ten liters of\nfluid ingested daily. There are many different conditionsthat affect fluid and nutrient absorption by the intestine. Afault in the digestive process may result from failure of thebody to produce the enzymes needed to digest certainfoods. Congenital structural defects or diseases of the pan-creas, gall bladder, or liver may alter the digestive process.Inflammation, infection, injury, or surgical removal of por-tions of the intestine may also result in absorption prob-lems; reduced length or surface area of intestine availablefor fluid and nutrient absorption can result in malabsorp-tion. Radiation therapy may injure the mucosal lining of\nthe intestine, resulting in diarrhea that may not become\nevident until several years later. The use of some antibi-\notics can also affect the bacteria that normally live in the\nintestine and affect intestinal function.\nRisk factors for malabsorption syndrome include:\n• family history of malabsorption or cystic fibrosis\n• use of certain drugs, such as mineral oil or other laxa-\ntives\n• travel to foreign countries\n• intestinal surgery• excess alcohol consumption\nThe most common symptoms of malabsorption\ninclude:\n• anemia, with weakness and fatigue due to inadequate\nabsorption of vitamin B\n12, iron, and folic acid\n• diarrhea, steatorrhea (excessive amount of fat in the\nstool), and abdominal distention with cramps, bloating,and gas due to impaired water and carbohydrateabsorption, and irritation from unabsorbed fatty acids.The individual may also report explosive diarrhea withgreasy, foul-smelling stools.\n•edema (fluid retention in the body’s tissues) due to\ndecreased protein absorption\n• malnutrition and weight loss due to decreased fat, car-\nbohydrate, and protein absorption. Weight may be 80-90% of usual weight despite increased oral intake ofnutrients.\n• muscle cramping due to decreased vitamin D, calcium,\nand potassium levels\n• muscle wasting and atrophy due to decreased protein\nabsorption and metabolism\n• perianal skin burning, itching , or soreness due to fre-\nquent loose stools\nIrregular heart rhythms may also result from inade-\nquate levels of potassium and other electrolytes. Bloodclotting disorders may occur due to a vitamin K defi-\nciency . Children with malabsorption syndrome often\nexhibit a failure to grow and thrive.Several disorders can lead to malabsorption syn-\ndrome, including cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis ,\nlactose intolerance , and gluten enteropathy (non-tropi-\ncal sprue.)\nTropical sprue is a malabsorptive disorder that is\nuncommon in the United States, but seen more often inpeople from the Caribbean, India, or southeast Asia.Although its cause is unknown, it is thought to be related toenvironmental factors, including infection, intestinal para-sites, or possibly the consumption of certain food toxins.Symptoms often include a sore tongue, anemia, weightloss, along with diarrhea and passage of fatty stools.\nWhipple’s disease is a relatively rare malabsorptive\ndisorder, affecting mostly middle-aged men. The cause isthought to be related to bacterial infection, resulting innutritional deficiencies, chronic low-grade fever , diar-\nrhea, joint pain , weight loss, and darkening of the skin’s\npigmentation. Other organs of the body may be affected,including the brain, heart, lungs, and eyes.\nShort bowel syndromes—which may be present at\nbirth (congenital) or the result of surgery—reduce thesurface area of the bowel available to absorb nutrientsand can also result in malabsorption syndrome.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of malabsorption syndrome and identi-\nfication of the underlying cause can require extensivediagnostic testing. The first phase involves a thoroughmedical history and physical examination by a physician,\nwho will then determine the appropriate laboratory studiesand x rays to assist in diagnosis. A 72-hour stool collectionmay be ordered for fecal fat measurement; increased fecalfat in the stool collected indicates malabsorption. A biopsyof the small intestine may be done to assist in differentiat-ing between malabsorption syndrome and small boweldisease. Ultrasound, computed tomography scan (CTscan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), barium\nenema , or other x rays to identify abnormalities of the gas-\ntrointestinal tract and pancreas may also be ordered.\nLaboratory studies of the blood may include:\n• Serum cholesterol. May be low due to decreased fat\nabsorption and digestion.\n• Serum sodium, potassium, and chloride. May be low\ndue to electrolyte losses with diarrhea.\n• Serum calcium. May be low due to vitamin D and\namino acid malabsorption.\n• Serum protein and albumin. May be low due to protein\nlosses.\n• Serum vitamin A and carotene. May be low due to bile\nsalt deficiency and impaired fat absorption.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2086Malabsorption syndrome• D-xylose test. Decreased excretion may indicate malab-\nsorption.\n• Schilling test. May indicate malabsorption of vitamin\nB12.\nTreatment\nFluid and nutrient monitoring and replacement is\nessential for any individual with malabsorption syn-drome. Hospitalization may be required when severe fluidand electrolyte imbalances occur. Consultation with adietitian to assist with nutritional support and meal plan-ning is helpful. If the patient is able to eat, the diet andsupplements should provide bulk and be rich in carbohy-drates, proteins, fats, minerals , and vitamins . The patient\nshould be encouraged to eat several small, frequent mealsthroughout the day, avoiding fluids and foods that pro-mote diarrhea. Intake and output should be monitored,along with the number, color, and consistency of stools.\nThe individual with malabsorption syndrome must be\nmonitored for dehydration , including dry tongue, mouth\nand skin; increased thirst; low, concentrated urine output;or feeling weak or dizzy when standing. Pulse and bloodpressure should be monitored, observing for increased orirregular pulse rate, or hypotension (low blood pressure).\nThe individual should also be alert for signs of nutrient,vitamin, and mineral depletion, including nausea or vomit-ing; fissures at corner of mouth; fatigue or weakness; dry,pluckable hair; easy bruising; tingling in fingers or toes;and numbness or burning sensation in legs or feet. Fluidvolume excess, as a result of diminished protein stores,may require fluid intake restrictions. The physician shouldalso be notified of any shortness of breath .\nOther specific medical management for malabsorp-\ntion syndrome is dependent upon the cause. Treatment fortropical sprue consists of folic acid supplements and long-term antibiotics. Depending on the severity of the disor-der, this treatment may be continued for six months orlonger. Whipple’s disease also may require long-term useof antibiotics, such as tetracycline. Management of someindividuals with malabsorption syndrome may requireinjections of vitamin B\n12and oral iron supplements. The\ndoctor may also prescribe enzymes to replace missingintestinal enzymes, or antispasmodics to reduce abdomi-nal cramping and associated diarrhea. People with cysticfibrosis and chronic pancreatitis require pancreatic sup-plements. Those with lactose intolerance or glutenenteropathy (non-tropical sprue) will have to modify theirdiets to avoid foods that they cannot properly digest.\nPrognosis\nThe expected course for the individual with malab-\nsorption syndrome varies depending on the cause. TheKEY TERMS\nAnemia —A decrease in the number of red blood\ncells in the bloodstream, characterized by pallor,loss of energy, and generalized weakness.\nAtrophy —A wasting away of a tissue or organ,\noften because of insufficient nutrition.\nBiopsy —A tissue sample removed from the body\nfor examination under the microscope.\nCystic fibrosis —A hereditary genetic disorder that\noccurs most often in Caucasians. Thick, stickysecretions from mucus-producing glands causeblockages in the pancreatic ducts and the airways.\nEdema —From the Greek word meaning swelling,\nan excessive accumulation of fluid in the tissuespaces. Excessive generalized edema may also bereferred to as ascites.\nGluten enteropathy —A hereditary malabsorption\ndisorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, a proteinfound in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Also callednon-tropical sprue or celiac disease.\nIntestines —The intestines, also known as the bow-\nels, are divided into the large and small intestines.They extend from the stomach to the anus.\nShort bowel syndrome —A condition in which the\nbowel is not as long as normal, either because ofsurgery or because of a congenital defect. Becausethe bowel has less surface area to absorb nutri-ents, it can result in malabsorption syndrome.\nSteatorrhea —An excessive amount of fat in the\nstool.\nonset of symptoms may be slow and difficult to diag-\nnose. Treatment may be long, complicated, and changedoften for optimal effectiveness. Patience and a positiveattitude are important in controlling or curing the disor-der.

Itis characterized by recurrent symptoms of chills, fever ,\nand an enlarged spleen. The disease can be treated withmedication, but it often recurs. Malaria is endemic(occurs frequently in a particular locality) in many thirdworld countries. Isolated, small outbreaks sometimesoccur within the boundaries of the United States.\nDescription\nMalaria is not a serious problem in the United\nStates. Within the last 10 years, only about 1,200 caseshave been reported each year in this country, mostly bypeople who were infected elsewhere. Locally transmit-ted malaria has occurred in California, Florida, Texas,Michigan, New Jersey, and New York City. Whilemalaria can be transmitted in blood, the Americanblood supply is not screened for malaria. Widespreadmalarial epidemics are far less likely to occur in theUnited States, but small, localized epidemics couldreturn to the western world.\nThe picture is far more bleak outside the territori-\nal boundaries of the United States. A recent govern-ment panel warned that disaster looms over Africafrom the disease. Malaria infects between 300 and 500million people every year in Africa, India, southeastAsia, the Middle East, Oceania, and Central and SouthAmerica. About 2 million of the infected die eachyear. Most of the cases and almost all of the deathsoccur in sub-Saharan Africa. At the present time,malaria kills about twice as many people as doesAIDS . As many as half a billion people worldwide are\nleft with chronic anemia due to malaria infection. Insome parts of Africa, people battle up to 40 or moreseparate episodes of malaria in their lifetimes. Thespread of malaria is becoming even more serious asthe parasites that cause malaria develop resistance tothe drugs used to treat the condition.\nCauses and symptoms\nHuman malaria is caused by four different species of\na parasite called plasmodium: Plasmodium falciparum\n(the most deadly), P .vivax ,P . malariae, and P . ovale . The\nlast two are fairly uncommon. Many animals can getmalaria but human malaria does not spread to animals. Inturn, animal malaria does not spread to humans.\nA person gets malaria when bitten by a female mos-\nquito who is looking for a blood meal and is infectedwith the malaria parasite. The parasites enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver, where they multiply. Whenthey re-emerge into the blood, symptoms appear. By thetime a patient shows symptoms, the parasites have repro-duced very rapidly, clogging blood vessels and rupturingblood cells.\nMalaria cannot be casually transmitted directly from\none person to another. Instead, a mosquito bites aninfected person and then passes the infection on to thenext human it bites. It is also possible to spread malariavia contaminated needles or in blood transfusions. Thisis why all blood donors are carefully screened with ques-tionnaires for possible exposure to malaria.\nThe amount of time between the mosquito bite and\nthe appearance of symptoms varies, depending on thestrain of parasite involved. The incubation period is usu-ally between 8 and 12 days for falciparum malaria, but itcan be as long as a month for the other types. Symptomsfrom some strains of P .vivax may not appear until eight\nto 10 months after the mosquito bite occurred.\nThe primary symptom of all types of malaria is the\n“malaria ague” (chills and fever). In most cases, the feverhas three stages, beginning with uncontrollable shiveringfor an hour or two, followed by a rapid spike in tempera-ture (as high as 106°F), which lasts three to six hours.Then, just as suddenly, the patient begins to sweat pro-fusely, which will quickly bring down the fever. Othersymptoms may include fatigue , severe headache ,o r\nnausea and vomiting . As the sweating subsides, the\npatient typically feels exhausted and falls asleep. Inmany cases, this cycle of chills, fever, and sweatingoccurs every other day, or every third day, and may lastfor between a week and a month. Those with the chronicform of malaria may have a relapse as long as 50 yearsafter the initial infection.\nFalciparum malaria is far more severe than other\ntypes of malaria because the parasite attacks all red bloodcells, not just the young or old cells, as do other types. It\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2088Malariacauses the red blood cells to become very “sticky.” A\npatient with this type of malaria can die within hours ofthe first symptoms. The fever is prolonged. So many redblood cells are destroyed that they block the blood ves-sels in vital organs (especially the kidneys), and the\nspleen becomes enlarged. There may be brain damage,leading to coma and convulsions. The kidneys and liver\nmay fail.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2089Malaria\nStomachZygote\nOocyst\nSporogony\noccurs\nSporozoitesdevelopSporozoitesreleased andmigrate tosalivary gland\nSalivary gland\nSporozoiteMOSQUITO\nHUMANBlood vessel\nof human host\nSporozoite\nentering liver cell\nSporozoite becomesmerozoite\nCYCLE IN \nLIVER CELLSLiver\nInfect other\nliver cellsor enter redblood cells\nLiberation of\nmerozoitesCYCLE IN\nBLOOD CELLSTrophozoite\nAmeboid\nformGametocytes\nMerozoite entering\nred cellGametocytes \nbecome differentiated into egg and spermFertilization\nINCUBATION PERIOD CHILLS AND FEVER STAGE\nThe life cycle of Plasmodium vivax, the parasite that causes malaria. (Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)Malaria in pregnancy can lead to premature deliv-\nery,miscarriage , or stillbirth .\nCertain kinds of mosquitoes (called anopheles) can\npick up the parasite by biting an infected human. (Themore common kinds of mosquitoes in the United Statesdo not transmit the infection.) This is true for as long asthat human has parasites in his/her blood. Since strains ofmalaria do not protect against each other, it is possible tobe reinfected with the parasites again and again. It is alsopossible to develop a chronic infection without develop-ing an effective immune response.\nDiagnosis\nMalaria is diagnosed by examining blood under a\nmicroscope. The parasite can be seen in the blood smearson a slide. These blood smears may need to be repeatedover a 72-hour period in order to make a diagnosis. Anti-body tests are not usually helpful because many peopledeveloped antibodies from past infections, and the testsmay not be readily available.\nAnyone who becomes ill with chills and fever after\nbeing in an area where malaria exists must see a doctorand mention their recent travel to endemic areas. A per-son with the above symptoms who has been in a high-risk area should insist on a blood test for malaria. Thedoctor may believe the symptoms are just the commonflu virus. Malaria is often misdiagnosed by North Ameri-can doctors who are not used to seeing the disease.Delaying treatment of falciparum malaria can be fatal.\nTreatment\nFalciparum malaria is a medical emergency that\nmust be treated in the hospital. The type of drugs, themethod of giving them, and the length of the treatmentdepend on where the malaria was contracted and howsick the patient is.\nFor all strains except falciparum, the treatment for\nmalaria is usually chloroquine (Aralen) by mouth forthree days. Those falciparum strains suspected to beresistant to chloroquine are usually treated with a combi-nation of quinine and tetracycline. In countries wherequinine resistance is developing, other treatments mayinclude clindamycin (Cleocin), mefloquin (Lariam), orsulfadoxone/pyrimethamine (Fansidar). Most patientsreceive an antibiotic for seven days. Those who are veryill may need intensive care and intravenous (IV) malariatreatment for the first three days.\nAnyone who acquired falciparum malaria in the\nDominican Republic, Haiti, Central America west of thePanama Canal, the Middle East, or Egypt can still becured with chloroquine. Almost all strains of falciparummalaria in Africa, South Africa, India, and southeast Asia\nare now resistant to chloroquine. In Thailand and Cam-bodia, there are strains of falciparum malaria that havesome resistance to almost all known drugs.\nA patient with falciparum malaria needs to be hospi-\ntalized and given antimalarial drugs in different combi-\nnations and doses depending on the resistance of thestrain. The patient may need IV fluids, red blood celltransfusions, kidney dialysis , and assistance breathing.\nA drug called primaquine may prevent relapses after\nrecovery from P . vivax or P . ovale . These relapses are\ncaused by a form of the parasite that remains in the liverand can reactivate months or years later.\nAnother new drug, halofantrine, is available abroad.\nWhile it is licensed in the United States, it is not market-ed in this country and it is not recommended by the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\nAlternative treatment\nThe Chinese herb qiinghaosu (the western name is\nartemisinin) has been used in China and southeast Asia tofight severe malaria, and became available in Europe in1994. Because this treatment often fails, it is usuallycombined with another antimalarial drug (mefloquine) toboost its effectiveness. It is not available in the UnitedStates and other parts of the developed world due to fearsof its toxicity, in addition to licensing and other issues.\nA western herb called wormwood ( Artemesia annua )\nthat is taken as a daily dose can be effective againstmalaria. Protecting the liver with herbs like goldenseal(Hydrastis canadensis ), Chinese goldenthread ( Coptis\nchinensis ), and milk thistle ( Silybum marianum ) can be\nused as preventive treatment. Preventing mosquitoes frombiting you while in the tropics is another possible way toavoid malaria.\nPrognosis\nIf treated in the early stages, malaria can be cured.\nThose who live in areas where malaria is epidemic, how-ever, can contract the disease repeatedly, never fullyrecovering between bouts of acute infection.\nPrevention\nSeveral researchers are currently working on a\nmalarial vaccine, but the complex life cycle of the malar-ia parasite makes it difficult. A parasite has much moregenetic material than a virus or bacterium. For this rea-son, a successful vaccine has not yet been developed.\nMalaria is an especially difficult disease to vaccinate\nagainst because the parasite goes through several sepa-rate stages. One recent, promising vaccine appears to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2090Malariahave protected up to 60% of people exposed to maleria.\nThis was evident during field trials for the drug that wereconducted in South America and Africa. It is not yetcommercially available.\nThe World Health Association (WHO) has been trying\nto eliminate malaria for the past 30 years by controllingmosquitoes. Their efforts were successful as long as the pes-ticide DDT killed mosquitoes and antimalarial drugs curedthose who were infected. Today, however, the problem hasreturned a hundredfold, especially in Africa. Because boththe mosquito and parasite are now extremely resistant to theinsecticides designed to kill them, governments are now try-ing to teach people to take antimalarial drugs as a preventivemedicine and avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes.\nTravelers to high-risk areas should use insect repel-\nlant containing DEET for exposed skin. Because DEETis toxic in large amounts, children should not use a con-centration higher than 35%. DEET should not be inhaled.It should not be rubbed onto the eye area, on any brokenor irritated skin, or on children’s hands. It should be thor-oughly washed off after coming indoors.\nThose who use the following preventive measures\nget fewer infections than those who do not:\n• between dusk and dawn, remain indoors in well-\nscreened areas\n• sleep inside pyrethrin or permethrin repellent-soaked\nmosquito nets\n• wear clothes over the entire bodyKEY TERMS\nArteminisinins —An antimalarial family of products\nderived from an ancient Chinese herbal remedy.Two of the most popular varieties are artemetherand artesunate, used mainly in southeast Asia incombination with mefloquine.\nChloroquine —This antimalarial drug was first used\nin the 1940s, until the first evidence of quinineresistance appeared in the 1960s. It is now ineffec-tive against falciparum malaria almost everywhere.However, because it is inexpensive, it is still theantimalarial drug most widely used in Africa. Nativeindividuals with partial immunity may have betterresults with chloroquine than a traveler with no pre-vious exposure.\nMefloquine —An antimalarial drug that was devel-\noped by the United States Army in the early 1980s.Today, malaria resistance to this drug has become aproblem in some parts of Asia (especially Thailand\nand Cambodia).\nQuinine —One of the first treatments for malaria,\nquinine is a natural product made from the bark ofthe Cinchona tree. It was popular until being super-seded by the development of chloroquine in the1940s. In the wake of widespread chloroquineresistance, however, it has become popular again. Itor its close relative quinidine can be given intra-venously to treat severe falciparum malaria.\nSulfadoxone/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) —This anti-\nmalarial drug developed in the 1960s is the firstdrug tried in some parts of the world wherechloroquine resistance is widespread. It has beenassociated with severe allergic reactions due to itssulfa component.\nAnyone visiting endemic areas should take anti-\nmalarial drugs starting a day or two before they leave theUnited States. The drugs used are usually chloroquine ormefloquine. This treatment is continued through at leastfour weeks after leaving the endemic area. However,even those who take antimalarial drugs and are careful toavoid mosquito bites can still contract malaria.\nInternational travelers are at risk for becoming\ninfected. Most Americans who have acquired falciparummalaria were visiting sub-Saharan Africa; travelers inAsia and South America are less at risk. Travelers whostay in air conditioned hotels on tourist itineraries inurban or resort areas are at lower risk than backpackers,missionaries, and Peace Corps volunteers. Some peoplein western cities where malaria does not usually existmay acquire the infection from a mosquito carried onto ajet. This is called airport or runway malaria.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDesowitz, Robert S. The Malaria Capers: More Tales of Para-\nsites and People, Research and Reality. New York: W.

    "title": "Malignant lymphomas",
    "content": "Malignant lymphomas\nDefinition\nLymphomas are a group of cancers in which cells of\nthe lymphatic system become abnormal and start to growuncontrollably. Because there is lymph tissue in manyparts of the body, lymphomas can start in almost anyorgan of the body.\nDescription\nThe lymph system is made up of ducts or tubules\nthat carry lymph to all parts of the body. Lymph is amilky fluid that contains the lymphocytes or white bloodcells. These are the infection- fighting cells of the blood.Small pea-shaped organs are found along the network oflymph vessels. These are called the lymph nodes, andtheir main function is to make and store the lymphocytes.Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the pelvis region,underarm, neck, chest, and abdomen. The spleen (anorgan in the upper abdomen), the tonsils, and the thymus(a small organ found beneath the breastbone) are part ofthe lymphatic system.\nThe lymphocyte is the main cell of the lymphoid tis-\nsue. There are two main types of lymphocytes: the Tlymphocyte and the B lymphocyte. Lymphomas developfrom these two cell types. B cell lymphomas are morecommon among adults, while among children, the inci-dence of T and B cell lymphomas are almost equal.The T and the B cell perform different jobs within the\nimmune system. When an infectious bacterium enters thebody, the B cell makes proteins called “antibodies.” Theseantibodies attach themselves to the bacteria, and flagthem for destruction by other immune cells. The T cellshelp protect the body against viruses. When a virus entersthe cell, it generally produces certain proteins that areprojected on the surface of the infected cell. T cells recog-nize these proteins and produce certain substances(cytokines) that destroy the infected cells. Some of thecytokines made by the T cells attract other cell types,which are capable of digesting the virus-infected cell. TheT cells can also destroy some types of cancerous cells.\nLymphomas can be divided into two main types:\nHodgkin’s lymphoma or Hodgkin’s disease , and non-\nHodgkin’s lymphomas. There are at least 10 types ofnon-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. They are grouped (staged)by how aggressively they grow; slow growing (lowgrade), intermediate growing, and rapidly growing (highgrade); and how far they spread.\nA majority of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas begin in\nthe lymph nodes. About 20% start in other organs, suchas the lungs, liver or the gastrointestinal tract. Malignantlymphocytes multiply uncontrollably and do not performtheir normal functions. Hence, the body’s ability to fightinfections is affected. In addition, these malignant cellsmay crowd the bone marrow, and, depending on thestage, prevent the production of normal red blood cells,white blood cells, and platelets. A low red blood cellcount causes anemia, while a reduction in the number ofplatelets makes the person susceptible to excessivebleeding. Cancerous cells can also invade other organsthrough the circulatory system of the lymph, causingthose organs to malfunction.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas is not\nknown. However, the incidence has increased signifi-cantly in recent years. Part of the increase is due to theAIDS epidemic. Individuals infected with the AIDS\nvirus have a higher likelihood of developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. In general, males are at a higherrisk for having non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas than arefemales. The risk increases with age. Though it can strikepeople as young as 40, people between the ages of 60and 69 are at the highest risk.\nPeople exposed to certain pesticides and ionizing\nradiation have a higher than average chance of develop-ing this disease. For example, an increased incidence oflymphomas has been seen in survivors of the atomicbomb explosion in Hiroshima, and in people who haveundergone aggressive radiation therapy . People who\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2092Malignant lymphomassuffer from immune-deficient disorders, as well as those\nwho have been treated with immune suppressive drugsfor heart or kidney transplants, and for conditions such asrheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases, are at\nan increased risk for this disease.\nThere have been some studies that have shown a\nloose association between retroviruses, such as HTLV-I,and some rare forms of lymphoma. The Epstein-Barrvirus has been linked to Burkitt’s lymphoma in Africancountries. However, a direct cause-and-effect relation-ship has not been established.\nThe symptoms of lymphomas are often vague and\nnon-specific. Patients may experience loss of appetite,weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort,and indigestion . The patient may complain of a feeling\nof fullness, which is a result of enlarged lymph nodes inthe abdomen. Pressure or pain in the lower back is\nanother symptom. In the advanced stages, the patientmay have bone pain, headaches, constant coughing, andabnormal pressure and congestion in the face, neck, andupper chest. Some may have fevers and night sweats. Inmost cases, patients go to the doctor because of the pres-ence of swollen glands in the neck, armpits, or groinarea. Since all the symptoms are common to many otherillnesses, it is essential to seek medical attention if any ofthe conditions persist for two weeks or more. Only aqualified physician can correctly diagnose if the symp-toms are due to lymphoma or some other ailment.\nDiagnosis\nLike all cancers, lymphomas are best treated when\nfound early. However, it is often difficult to diagnose lym-phomas. There are no screening tests available, and, sincethe symptoms are non-specific, lymphomas are rarely rec-ognized in their early stages. Detection often occurs bychance during a routine physical examination .\nWhen the doctor suspects lymphoma, a complete\nmedical history is taken, and a thorough physical examina-tion is performed. Enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver,or spleen may suggest lymphomas. Blood tests will deter-mine the cell counts and obtain information on how wellthe organs, such as the kidney and liver, are functioning.\nA biopsy of the enlarged lymph node is the most\ndefinitive diagnostic tool for staging purposes. The doc-tor may perform a bone marrow biopsy. During the biop-sy, a cylindrical piece of bone and marrow fluid isremoved. They are generally taken out of the hipbone.These samples are sent to the laboratory for examination.In addition to diagnosis, the biopsy may also be repeatedduring the treatment phase of the disease to see if thelymphoma is responding to therapy.Once the exact form of lymphoma is known, it is then\nstaged to determine how aggressive it is, and how far it hasspread. Staging is necessary to plan appropriate treatment.\nConventional imaging tests, such as x rays, comput-\ned tomography scans (CT scans), magnetic resonance\nimaging , and abdominal sonograms, are used to deter-\nmine the extent of spread of the disease.\nLymphangiograms are x rays of the lymphatic sys-\ntem. In this procedure, a special dye is injected into thelymphatic channels through a small cut (incision) made ineach foot. The dye is injected slowly over a period ofthree to four hours. This dye clearly outlines the lymphat-ic system and allows it to stand out. Multiple x rays arethen taken and any abnormality, if present, is revealed.\nRarely, a lumbar puncture or a spinal tap is per-\nformed to check if malignant cells are present in the fluidsurrounding the brain. In this test, the physician inserts aneedle into the epidural space at the base of the spine andcollects a small amount of spinal fluid for microscopicexamination.\nTreatment\nTreatment options for lymphomas depend on the\ntype of lymphoma and its present stage. In most cases,treatment consists of chemotherapy , radiotherapy, or a\ncombination of the two methods.\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to kill\ncancer cells. In non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, combination\ntherapy, which involves the use of multiple drugs, hasbeen found more effective than single drug use. Thetreatment may last about six months, but in some casesmay last as long as a year. The drugs may either beadministered intravenously (through a vein) in the arm orgiven orally in the form of pills. If cancer cells haveinvaded the central nervous system, then chemotherapeu-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2093Malignant lymphomas\nA malignant lymph cell. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-\nduced by permission.)tic drugs may be instilled, through a needle in the brain\nor back, into the fluid that surrounds the brain. This pro-cedure is known as intrathecal chemotherapy.\nRadiation therapy, where high-energy ionizing rays\nare directed at specific portions of the body, such as theupper chest, abdomen, pelvis, or neck, is often used fortreatment of lymphomas. External radiation therapy,where the rays are directed from a source outside thebody, is the most common mode of radiation treatment.\nBone marrow transplantation is used in cases\nwhere the lymphomas do not respond to conventionaltherapy, or in cases where the patient has had a relapse orsuffers from recurrent lymphomas.\nThere are two ways of doing bone marrow trans-\nplantation. In a procedure called “allogeneic bone mar-row transplant,” a donor is found whose marrow matchesthat of the patient. The donor can be a twin (best match),a sibling, or a person who is not related at all. High-dosechemotherapy or radiation therapy is given to eradicatethe lymphoma. The donor marrow is then given toreplace the marrow destroyed by the therapy.\nIn “autologous bone marrow transplantation,” some\nof the patient’s own bone marrow is harvested, chemical-ly purged, and frozen. High-dose chemotherapy and radi-ation therapy are given. The marrow that was harvested,purged, and frozen is then thawed and put back into thepatient’s body to replace the destroyed marrow.\nA new treatment option for patients with lymphoma\nis known as “peripheral stem cell transplantation.” In thistreatment approach, cells that normally circulate in theblood are collected when the patient has normal bloodcounts taken, and these cells are saved via a processcalled “pheresis.” Researchers are exploring whetherthese cells can be used to restore the normal function anddevelopment of blood cells, rather than using a bonemarrow transplant.KEY TERMS\nAntibodies —Proteins made by the B lymphocytes\nin response to the presence of infectious agentssuch as bacteria or viruses in the body.\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and microscopic\nexamination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.\nGrowth factors (cytokines) —Chemicals made by\nthe cells that act on other cells to stimulate orinhibit their function. Cytokines that stimulategrowth are called “growth factors.”Prognosis\nLike all cancers, the prognosis for lymphoma depends\non the stage of the cancer, and the patient’s age and gener-al health. When all the different types and stages of lym-phoma are considered together, only 50% of patients sur-vive 5 years or more after initial diagnosis. This is becausesome types of lymphoma are more aggressive than others.\nThe survival rate among children is definitely better\nthan among older people. About 90% of the childrendiagnosed with early stage disease survive 5 years ormore, while only 60-70% of adults diagnosed with lowgrade lymphomas survive for 5 years or more. The sur-vival rate for children with the more advanced stages isabout 75-85%, while among adults it is 40-60%.\nPrevention\nAlthough many cancers may be prevented by mak-\ning diet and lifestyle changes which reduce risk factors,there is currently no known way to prevent lymphomas.Protecting oneself from developing AIDS, which may bea risk factor for lymphomas, is the only preventive mea-sure that can be practiced.\nAt present, there are no special tests that are available\nfor early detection of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Payingprompt attention to the signs and symptoms of this dis-ease, and seeing a doctor if the symptoms persist, are thebest strategies for an early diagnosis of lymphoma. Earlydetection affords the best chance for a cure.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerkow, Robert, et al., eds. Merck Manual of Diagnosis and\nTherapy. 17th ed.

    "title": "Malignant melanoma",
    "content": "Malignant melanoma\nDefinition\nMalignant Melanoma is a type of cancer arising\nfrom the melanocyte cells of the skin. The melanocytesare cells in the skin that produce the pigment melanin.Malignant melanoma develops when the melanocytes nolonger respond to normal control mechanisms of cellulargrowth and are capable of invasion locally or spread toother organs in the body (metastasis), where again theyinvade and compromise the function of that organ.\nDescription\nMelanocytes, embryologically derived from the\nneural crest, are distributed in the epidermis and thus arefound throughout the skin. They produce a brown pig-ment known as melanin and are responsible for racialvariation in skin color and also the color of moles . Malig-\nnant degeneration of the melanocyte gives rise to thetumor, melanoma, of which there are four subtypes.These are: superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna,and acral lentiginous melanomas, accounting for 70%,15% to 30%, 4% to 10%, and 2% to 8% of cases, respec-tively. Malignant melanoma may develop anywhere onthe body. In men, it is most common on the trunk. Inwomen, it is most common on the back or legs. The sub-type also may influence where the tumor develops; lenti-go melanoma is more common on the face while acrallentiginous melanoma is more common on the palms ofthe hand, soles of the feet, or in the nail beds.\nThe locally invasive characteristic of this tumor\ninvolves vertical penetration through the skin and intothe dermis and subcutaneous (under-the-skin) tissues ofthe malignant melanocytes. With the exception of thenodular variety of melanoma, there is often a phase ofradial or lateral growth associated with these tumors.Since it is the vertical growth that characterizes themalignancy, the nodular variant of melanoma carries theworst prognosis. Fortunately, the superficial spreadingtype is most common.\nThe primary tumor begins in the skin, often from the\nmelanocytes of a pre-existing mole. Once it becomesinvasive, it may progress beyond the site of origin to theregional lymph nodes or travel to other organ systems inthe body and become systemic in nature.\nThe lymph is the clear, protein-rich fluid that bathes\nthe cells throughout our body. Lymph will work its wayback to the bloodstream via small channels known aslymphatics. Along the way, the lymph is filtered throughcellular stations known as nodes, thus they are calledlymph nodes. Nearly all organs in the body have a prima-ry lymph node group filtering the tissue fluid, or lymph,that comes from that organ. Different areas of the skinhave different primary nodal stations. For the leg, they arein the groin. For the arm, the armpit or axilla. For the face,it is the neck. Depending where on the torso the tumordevelops, it may drain into one groin or armpit, or both.\nCancer, as it invades in its place of origin, may also\nwork its way into blood vessels. If this occurs, it providesyet another route for the cancer to spread to other organsof the body. When the cancer spreads elsewhere in thebody, it has become systemic in extent and the tumorgrowing elsewhere is known as a metastasis.\nUntreated, malignant melanoma follows a classic\nprogression. It begins and grows locally, penetrating ver-tically. It may be carried via the lymph to the regionalnodes, known as regional metastasis. It may go from thelymph to the bloodstream or penetrate blood vessels,directly allowing it a route to go elsewhere in the body.When systemic disease or distant metastasis occur,melanoma commonly involves the lung, brain, liver, oroccasionally bone. The malignancy causes death when its\nuncontrolled growth compromises vital organ function.\nOf the anticipated new cases of cancer for the year\n2001 in the United States, malignant melanoma willaccount for 5% of malignancies in men and 4% inwomen, being the sixth most common cancer in men andthe seventh in women. It is estimated there will be553,400 total cancer deaths in the United States in 2001.Malignant melanoma will account for 7,800 for an inci-dence of 1.5% of total deaths related to cancer.\nThe incidence of primary cutaneous malignant\nmelanoma has been steadily increasing, possibly relatedto increase of sun exposure. Currently, the risk is about\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2095Malignant melanoma13 per 100,000 of the population. It affects all age groups\nbut is most commonly seen in patients between 30 and60 years of age.\nSun exposure definitely increases risk of developing\nmelanoma. The melanocytes are part of the integument’sphotoprotective mechanism; in response to sunlight, theyproduce melanin that has a protective role from the sun’sultraviolet rays. For Caucasians, the amount of melaninpresent in the skin is directly related to sun exposure.However, it is not so much the total sun exposure thatseems important, rather it is the history of sunburn ,\n(especially if severe or at an early age), that correlateswith the increased risk. On this basis populations of fair-skinned people living in areas of high sun exposure suchas the southwest United States or Australia are subject toincreased risk. Malignant melanoma also affects non-Caucasians—though sun exposure probably does notplay a role—at a rate of 10% that of Caucasians.\nMalignant melanoma may arise in the skin anywhere\non the body. It is estimated that 50% to 70% develop spon-taneously while the remainder start in a pre-existing mole.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe predisposing causes to the development of\nmalignant melanoma are environmental and genetic. Theenvironmental factor is excessive sun exposure. Thereare also genetically transmitted familial syndromes withalterations in the CDKN2A gene, which encodes for thetumor-suppressing proteins p16 and p19.\nAs mentioned previously, melanin production in\nfair-skinned people is induced by sun exposure. An expo-sure substantial enough to result in a mild sunburn willbe followed by melanin producing a tan that may last afew weeks. Both ultraviolet radiation and damaging oxy-gen radicals caused by sun exposure may damage cells,particularly their DNA. It is suspected that this damageinduces mutations that result in the development ofmalignant melanoma. Though these mutations are alter-ations of the genome causing the melanoma, they areenvironmentally induced and account for sporadic orspontaneous cases of this disease.\nA positive family history of one or two first-degree\nrelatives having had melanoma substantially increasesthe risk on a genetic basis. A family tendency is observedin 8% to 12% of patients. There is a syndrome known asthe dysplasic (atypical), nevus syndrome that is charac-terized by atypical moles with bothersome clinical fea-tures in children under age 10. Such individuals have tobe observed closely for the development of malignantmelanoma. Chromosome 9p has been identified as beinginvolved in familial predisposition. There are mutationsin up to 50% of familial melanoma patients of the tumor-suppressing gene CDKN2A. The actual number of moles\nincreases risk, but the size of the moles needs be consid-ered. Those with 10 larger moles of over 1 cm (0.4 in.)are at more risk than those with a higher number (50-99)of smaller moles. Finally, when a child is born with alarge congenital mole, careful observation for change isappropriate because of increased risk.\nAn excellent way of identifying changes of signifi-\ncance in a mole is the ABCD rule:\n• assymetry\n• border irregularity• color variegation\n• diameter exceeding 6 mm (0.24 in)\nNotice that three of the criteria refer to variability of\nthe lesion (color variegation refers to areas of light colorand black scattered within the mole). Thus small, uni-form regular lesions have less cause for concern. It isimportant to realize that change in a mole or the rapiddevelopment of a new one are very important symptoms.\nAnother summary of important changes in a mole is\nthe Glasgow 7-point scale. The symptoms and signs belowcan occur anywhere on the skin, including the palms of thehands, soles of the feet, and also the nail beds:\n• change in size• change in shape\n• change in color\n• inflammation• crusting and bleeding\n• sensory change\n• diameter more than 7 mm (0.28 in)\nIn this scheme, change is emphasized along with\nsize. Bleeding and sensory changes are relatively latesymptoms.\nSymptoms related to the presence of regional disease\nare mostly those of nodules or lumps in the areas contain-ing the lymph nodes draining the area. Thus nodularitycan be found in the armpit, the groin, or the neck ifregional nodes are involved. There is also a special typeof metastasis that can occur regionally with malignantmelanoma; it is known as an in-transit metastasis. If themelanoma is spreading through the lymph system, someof the tumor may grow there, resulting in a nodule partway between the primary site and the original lymphnode. These in-transit metastases are seen both at the timeof original presentation or later after primary treatmenthas been rendered, the latter being a type of recurrence.\nFinally, in those who either present with or progress\nto widespread or systemic disease, symptoms and signs\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2096Malignant melanomaare related to the affected organ. Thus neurologic prob-\nlems, lung problems, or liver problems develop depend-ing on the organ involved.\nDiagnosis\nNone of the clinical signs or symptoms discussed\nabove are absolute indications that a patient has malig-nant melanoma. The actual diagnosis is accomplished bybiopsy, a procedure that removes tissue to examine undera microscope. It is important that the signs and symp-toms are used to develop a suspicion of the diagnosisbecause the way the biopsy is performed for melanomamay be different than for other lesions of the skin.\nWhen dealing with an early malignant melanoma, it\nis very important to establish the exact thickness of pene-tration of the primary tumor. Any biopsy that doesn’tremove the full vertical extent of the primary is inade-quate. Therefore, if a skin lesion is suspicious, full thick-ness excisional biopsy is the approach recommended.Shave biopsies and biopsies that remove only a portionof the suspect area are inappropriate. Often, in an earlycase, the excision involves just the suspicious lesion withminimal normal skin, but it should be a full vertical exci-sion of the skin. If a melanoma is diagnosed, furthertreatment of this area will often be necessary but doesn’tcompromise outcome (prognosis). In some special areasof the body, minor modifications may be necessary aboutinitial total excision, but full thickness excision shouldalways be the goal. (See staging, below.)\nOnce the diagnosis is obtained, careful examination\nof the patient for regional lymph node involvementshould be done. A careful review to uncover any symp-toms of widespread disease is also appropriate.\nThe more common patient has an early melanoma,\nand extensive testing is not usually warranted. Routinetesting in this situation involves a complete blood count ,\na chest x ray , and determinations of blood enzymes\nincluding lactic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase.\nIf the patient has signs or symptoms of more\nadvanced disease, or if the lesion’s depth of penetrationis sizeable, further imaging studies may be appropriate.These would involve CAT scans of the abdomen, thechest, or regional nodal areas, or a CT or MRI of thebrain.\nTreatment\nThe key to successful treatment is early diagnosis.\nPatients identified with localized, thin, small lesions(typified by superficial spreading subtype) nearly alwayssurvive. For those with advanced lesions, the outcome ispoor in spite of progress in systemic therapy.Clinical staging\nMalignant melanoma is locally staged based on the\ndepth of penetration through the skin and its appendages.There are two ways of looking at the depth of penetra-tion. The Clarke system utilizes the layers of the dermisand the skin appendages present at that layer to identifythe depth of penetration. The Breslow system uses theabsolute measurement of depth. Though useful conceptu-ally, the Clarke system is used less frequently because ofthe fact that skin is of different thickness in differentregions of the body. The depth of penetration is muchgreater when the tumor reaches the subcutaneous fatwhen the skin involved is the back as opposed to the face.It turns out that the Breslow measurement is more repro-ducible and thus more useful; therefore, for purposeshere, depth of penetration by absolute measurement(Breslow) is used in local staging.\nStage I and stage II have no involvement of the\nregional lymph nodes and are thus localized to the site of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2097Malignant melanoma\nA close-up image of a malignant melanoma on a patient’s\nback. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)origin. These stages are subdivided on the basis of pene-\ntration. Stage Ia is 0.75 mm or less (1 mm = 0.04 in), andStage Ib is 0.75 mm to 1.5 mm penetration. Stage IIa is1.5 mm to 4.0 mm and Stage IIb is over 4.0 mm or intothe subcutaneous fat. In stage III and IV , there is diseasebeyond the primary site. Stage III is defined by the pres-ence of in-transit or regional nodal metastasis or both.Stage IV is defined by the presence of distant metastasis.\nOnce the diagnosis of malignant melanoma has been\nestablished by biopsy and the stage has been identifiedusing the results of the examination and studies, a treat-ment plan is developed. Melanoma is not cured unless itis diagnosed at a stage when it can be isolated andremoved surgically. Considerations revolve around theextent of the local and regional nodal surgery for stages Ithrough III. For stage IV patients, or those that are treat-ed and then develop recurrence at distant sites,chemotherapy or immunotherapy is planned. Studies\nare in progress to improve the results from traditionalchemotherapeutic regimens. Adjuvant therapy (auxiliarydrug treatment used to make possibility of relapse lessfor those at high risk) is also considered.\nSurgical therapy for the primary site is that of wide\nlocal removal of the skin including subcutaneous tissuesurrounding the lesion. In the past, wide excisions werelarge and encompassed 2 in (5 cm) of tissue in all direc-tions wherever feasible. It has been shown that such widelocal excisions are not necessary and the issue hasKEY TERMS\nAdjuvant therapy —Therapy administered to patients\nwho are at risk of having microscopic untreated dis-ease present but have no manifestations.\nDermis —The deeper portion or layer of the skin.\nDysplastic nevus syndrome —A familial syndrome\ncharacterized by the presence of multiple atypicalappearing moles, often at a young age.\nEpidermis —The superficial layer of the skin.\nGenome —Composed of DNA, the genome is the\ngenetic makeup of the cell.\nImmunotherapy —Therapy using biologic agents\nthat either enhance or stimulate normal immunefunction.\nIntegument —The skin.\nLymph node dissection —Surgical removal of an\nanatomic group of lymph nodes.Lymphedema —Swelling of an extremity following\nsurgical removal of the lymph nodes draining thatextremity.\nMelanocyte —Cells derived from the neural crest\nthat are in the skin and produce the protein pigmentmelanin.\nMetastasis —A tumor growth or deposit that has\nspread via lymph or blood to an area of the bodyremote from the primary tumor.\nNevus —A mole.\nResection —The act of removing something surgically.\nSkin appendages —Structures related to the integu-\nment such as hair follicles and sweat glands.\nSystemic disease —Used to refer to a patient who\nhas distant metastasis.\nVariegation —Patchy variation.\nbecome: how wide is enough? Studies from the World\nHealth Organization Melanoma Group and by theMelanoma Intergroup Committee in the United Stateshave provided general guidelines based on the depth ofpenetration of the melanoma. These guidelines andanatomic considerations need to be kept in mind by thesurgeon.\nThe next issue in primary management is whether\nor not the patient needs to have the regional lymphnodes removed in addition to treatment of the primarytumor. The problems associated with the resection ofregional lymph nodes are those of lifelong edema or\nswelling in the extremity. Though it does not occur inall patients (5% to 20%, depending on the extremityand extent of the dissection), it can be a disablingsymptom. Certainly, if it could be ascertained that therewas disease in the nodes, resection (removal) would beappropriate. However, if there was no disease, the riskof edema should be avoided. In patients with no signsof regional disease, depth of penetration of the primarytumor helps guide the decision. If the tumor penetratesless than 1mm, dissection is not usually done. If it is 1-2 mm, node dissection may be done at the time of pri-mary treatment or the patient may be observed and onlyundergo lymph node dissection if the area later showssigns of disease. If the patient has enlarged lymphnodes or the depth of the tumor has led to the evaluationby CAT scan showing enlarged nodes, resection of thenodes will be considered. In the latter case, more exten-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2098Malignant melanomasive imaging of the lung, liver, or brain may be appro-\npriate to be sure the patient doesn’t already have stageIV disease.\nQuestions related to which patients should have\nresection of regional lymph nodes have led to an interme-diary procedure known as sentinel node mapping andbiopsy. Intermediate thickness melanomas between 1and 4 mm deep (0.04 and 0.16 in) may have nodalinvolvement even if the exam and any other studies doneare normal. If a radioisotope tracer or blue dye is injectedinto the area of the primary tumor, very shortly it willtravel to the lymph nodes draining that area. These sen-tinel nodes are thus identifiable and are the most likely toharbor any regional metastatic disease. If these nodesalone are biopsied and are normal, the rest of the lymphnode group can be spared. If they show microscopicdeposits of tumor, then the full resection of the lymphnode group may be completed. This procedure allowsselection of those patients with intermediate thicknessmelanoma who will benefit from the regional lymphnode dissection.\nPatients with metastatic melanoma who do not\nrespond well to other therapies may be candidates fortreatment with aldesleukin. Aldesleukin is a form ofinterleukin, a specific kind of biological response modifi-er that promotes the development of T-cells. These cellsare part of the lymphatic system and can directly interactwith and fight cancer cells. Although aldesleukin is pro-duced naturally in the body, its therapeutic form is devel-oped via biotechnology in a laboratory setting. Treatmentis considered palliative, which means that it providescomfort but does not produce a cure. Side effects, how-ever, can be severe, and range from flu-like symptoms towhole-body infection ( sepsis ) and coma .\nSome patients, such as those with IIb or stage III\nmelanoma, are at high risk for the development of recur-rence after treatment. Although these patients are clinicallyfree of disease after undergoing primary treatment, they aremore likely to have some microscopic disease in the bodythat studies have not yet been able to identify. In an effort todecrease the rate of relapse, adjuvant therapy may be con-sidered. Interferon alpha 2a is an agent that stimulates theimmune system. This adjuvant therapy may slightlyincrease the duration of a patient’s disease-free state andlengthen overall survival. However, interferon alpha 2a hashigh toxicity and patients may not tolerate the side effects.\nUnfortunately, treatment for those patients who pre-\nsent with or go on to develop systemic disease usually fails.The chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine, or DTIC, seemsto be the most active agent. Overall responses are noted inabout 20% of patients, and they last only two to six months.Combination therapy may be an option. The regimen ofDTIC + BCNU (carmustine) + cisplatin + tamoxifen deliv-\ners a response rate of 40%. Combining biologic orimmunologic agents such as interferon with standardchemotherapeutic agents is under study and showingimproved response rates. However, toxicity is substantialand only healthier, younger patients tolerate the treatment.\nAlternative treatment\nThough radiation therapy has a minimal role in the\nprimary treatment of malignant melanoma, for patientswho have metastatic disease, radiation may be helpful.This is true in patients who have developed tumordeposits in areas such as the brain or the bone.\nPrognosis\nAlmost all patients survive stage Ia malignant\nmelanoma, and the suvivorship for stage I overall is morethan 90%. Survival drops in stage IIa to about 65% atfive years and is worse yet for stage IIb at slightly over50%. Stage III has a survival rate at 5 years of 10% to47%, depending on the size and number of regionalnodes involved. Stage IV malignant melanoma is almostalways a fatal disease.\nCoping with cancer treatment\nFor those with familial tendencies for malignant\nmelanoma, genetic counseling may be appropriate. Psy-\nchological counseling may be appropriate for anyonehaving trouble coping with a potentially fatal disease.Local cancer support groups may be helpful and areoften identified by contacting local hospitals or theAmerican Cancer Society.\nPrevention\nThough it is difficult to prove that sunscreens statis-\ntically reduce the frequency of malignant melanoma atthis time, most authorities recommend use as protectionfrom ultraviolet light (considered a major factor in thedevelopment of melanoma.) Avoidance of severe sun-burns is recommended.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAbeloff, Armitage, Lichter, and Niederhuber. Clinical Oncolo-\ngy Library, 2nd ed.

    "title": "Malingering",
    "content": "Malingering\nDefinition\nIn the context of medicine, malingering is the act of\nintentionally feigning or exaggerating physical or psy-chological symptoms for personal gain.\nDescription\nPeople may feign physical or psychological illness\nfor any number of reasons. Faked illness can get themout of work, military duty, or criminal prosecution. It canalso help them obtain financial compensation throughinsurance claims, lawsuits, or workers’ compensation.Feigned symptoms may also be a way of getting the doc-tor to prescribe certain drugs.\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association,\npatients who malinger are different from people whoinvent symptoms for sympathy (factitious diseases).Patients who malinger clearly have something tangible togain. People with factitious diseases appear to have aneed to play the “sick” role. They may feign illness forattention or sympathy.\nMalingering may take the form of complaints of\nchronic whiplash pain from automobile accidents.\nWhiplash claims are controversial. Although some peo-ple clearly do suffer from whiplash injury, others may beexaggerating the pain for insurance claims or lawsuits.Some intriguing scientific studies have shown that chron-ic whiplash pain after automobile accidents is almostnonexistent in Lithuania and Greece. In these countries,the legal systems do not encourage personal injury law-suits or financial settlements. The psychological symp-toms experienced by survivors of disaster ( post-trau-\nmatic stress disorder ) are also faked by malingerers.\nCauses and symptoms\nPeople malinger for personal gain. The symptoms\nmay vary. Generally malingerers complain of psycholog-ical disorders such as anxiety . They may also complain\nof chronic pain for which objective tests such as x rayscan find no physical cause. Because it is often impossibleto determine who is malingering and who is not, it isimpossible to know how frequently malingering occurs.\nDiagnosis\nMalingering may be suspected:\n• when a patient is referred for examination by an attorney\n• when the onset of illness coincides with a large finan-\ncial incentive, such as a new disability policy\n• when objective medical tests do not confirm the\npatient’s complaints\n• when the patient does not cooperate with the diagnostic\nwork-up or prescribed treatment\n• when the patient has antisocial attitudes and behaviors\n(antisocial personality)\nThe diagnosis of malingering is a challenge for doc-\ntors. On the one hand, the doctor does not want to over-look a treatable disease. On the other hand, he or shedoes not want to continue ordering tests and treatments ifthe symptoms are faked. Malingering is difficult to dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2100Malingeringtinguish from certain legitimate personality disorders ,\nsuch as factitious diseases or post-traumatic distress syn-drome. In legal cases, malingering patients may bereferred to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists use certain writtentests to try to determine whether the patient is faking thesymptoms.\nTreatment\nIn a sense, malingering cannot be treated because\nthe American Psychiatric Association does not recognizeit as a personality disorder. Patients who are purposefullyfaking symptoms for gain do not want to be cured. Often,the malingering patient fails to report any improvementwith treatment, and the doctor may try many treatmentswithout success.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

    "title": "Mallet finger",
    "content": "Mallet finger\nDefinition\nMallet finger refers to the involuntary flexion of the\ndistal phalanx of a finger caused by the disruption ortearing of its extensor tendon.\nDescription\nTendons are the strong “cables” between muscles and\nbones that help control movements of the body. They con-sist of white, glistening, fibrous cords, of various lengthand thickness, either round or flattened, and lacking inelasticity. In mallet finger, which often occurs as a sports-related injury, the tendon on the back of the fingerbecomes damaged or torn near the outermost joint. With-out the support provided by the tendon, the short bone atthe tip of the finger drops downward at an awkward angle.This bone, referred to as the “distal phalanx” of a finger, isthe one furthest from the palm. In addition to tendon dam-age, mallet finger may involve a fracture of the distal pha-lanx. Mallet finger is sometimes called baseball finger.\nCauses and symptoms\nMallet finger usually occurs while playing a sport that\ninvolves a ball—for example, reaching out to catch a hardpass in basketball or bare-handing a baseball. Instead oflanding on the palm of the hand, the ball accidentally hitsthe tip of an extended (or partially extended) finger. Thisstraight-on impact causes instantaneous stretch of the ten-don, which may overextend or tear away. Mallet finger canalso result from hitting the hand against a hard object orreceiving a cut from a sharp edge such as a knife.\nSymptoms of mallet finger include pain and\nswelling around the top part of the finger, near the outer-most joint. These symptoms occur right after the injury.Redness and swelling develop soon afterward. The tip ofthe finger has an abnormal-looking downward droop,and it may be difficult to fully extend the finger.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2101Mallet fingerDiagnosis\nMallet finger is usually diagnosed after a relatively\nbrief physical examination conducted by an emergency\ncare physician or by an orthopedist, the type of doctorwho specializes in such injuries. The downward droop ofthe fingertip is the major indication of mallet finger,along with the tenderness and pain that occurs in theaffected area. X rays will be taken to determine if thebone at the top of the finger has been fractured. Malletfinger is typically covered by medical insurance.\nTreatment\nIf symptoms of mallet finger appear, the affected\nindividual should consult a physician or seek emergencycare. In the meantime, ice (wrapped in a towel or cloth)can be applied to the affected area to help reduceswelling and alleviate pain.\nTreatment usually involves wearing a splint around\nthe top of the affected finger in order to keep it extendedand allow the injury to heal. The splint must be worn atall times for six to eight weeks, though it may be brieflyremoved to wash the finger, but with extreme care so asnot to allow the fingertip to bend. For the next six toeight weeks after that, the splint need only be worn dur-ing sleep or athletic activities.\nIf the bone at the top of the finger has sustained a\nlarge fracture, surgery may be necessary. If the tendonwas damaged due to a cut, stitches may be required bothto repair the tendon and to adequately close the wound.\nOver-the-counter (OTC) or prescription pain med-\nication can be used to alleviate pain.KEY TERMS\nDistal Phalanx —The outermost bone of any finger\nor toe.\nFracture —A break in bone.\nOrthopedist —A doctor who specializes in disor-\nders of the musculoskeletal system.\nPhalanx —Any of the digital bones of the hand or\nfoot.

    "content": "Mallory-Weiss syndrome\nDefinition\nMallory-Weiss syndrome is bleeding from an arteri-\nal blood vessel in the upper gastrointestinal tract, causedby a mucosal gastric tear at or near the point where theesophagus and stomach join.\nDescription\nMallory-Weiss syndrome causes about 5% of all\nupper gastrointestinal bleeding. The condition was origi-nally diagnosed in alcoholics and is associated withheavy alcohol use, although it can also be found inpatients who are not alcoholics. Earlier episodes of heavy\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2102Mallory-Weiss syndromehiccupping, vomiting, and retching are reported by about\nhalf the patients who are diagnosed with Mallory-Weisssyndrome. It is thought that the tear or laceration occurswhen there is a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pres-sure. Patients with increased pressure in the vein leadinginto the liver (portal hypertension ) are more likely to\nbleed heavily from an esophageal laceration than thosewhose blood pressure is normal.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn Mallory-Weiss syndrome, a tear occurs in the gas-\ntric mucosa, near where the esophagus and stomach join.About 10% of the tears are in the esophagus. Most areeither right at the junction of the esophagus and stomachor in the stomach just slightly below the junction.\nBleeding from the tear causes a disruption in fluid\nand electrolyte balance of the body. The patient oftenproduces vomit tinged with either fresh blood or older,blackish blood. Blood loss can be considerable.\nDiagnosis\nA Mallory-Weiss syndrome tear is not visible on\nstandard upper gastrointestinal x rays. A tear about one-eighth to one and one-half inches long (0.5-4 cm) isrevealed by endoscopy. Endoscopy also shows that in35% of patients there is another potential cause for gas-trointestinal bleeding, such as peptic ulcer, erosive gas-\ntritis , or esophageal varices.\nTreatment\nThe patient is resuscitated and stabilized with blood\ntransfusions and intravenous fluids to restore the fluidand electrolyte balance. Most of the time, esophagealbleeding stops spontaneously. When bleeding does notstop, patients are treated with an injection of epinephrine(adrenaline) and/or the bleeding artery is cauterized withheat. If these treatments fail, surgery is performed to stopthe bleeding.\nPrognosis\nIn 90-95% of patients whose bleeding does not stop\nspontaneously, cauterization without surgery will stopthe bleeding. Patients at highest risk for a recurrence ofbleeding are those with portal hypertension.\nPrevention\nMallory-Weiss syndrome is associated with alco-\nholism .

    "content": "Malnutrition\nDefinition\nMalnutrition is the condition that develops when the\nbody does not get the right amount of the vitamins ,min-\nerals , and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tis-\nsues and organ function.\nDescription\nUndernutrition\nMalnutrition occurs in people who are either under-\nnourished or over-nourished. Undernutrition is a conse-quence of consuming too few essential nutrients or usingor excreting them more rapidly than they can be replaced.\nInfants, young children, and teenagers need addi-\ntional nutrients. So do women who are pregnant or\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2103Malnutritionbreastfeeding. Nutrient loss can be accelerated by diar-\nrhea , excessive sweating, heavy bleeding (hemorrhage),\nor kidney failure. Nutrient intake can be restricted byage-related illnesses and conditions, excessive dieting,severe injury, serious illness, a lengthy hospitalization, orsubstance abuse.\nThe leading cause of death in children in developing\ncountries is protein-energy malnutrition . This type of\nmalnutrition is the result of inadequate intake of caloriesfrom proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Children who arealready undernourished can suffer from protein-energymalnutrition when rapid growth, infection, or diseaseincreases the need for protein and essential minerals.\nOvernutrition\nIn the United States, nutritional deficiencies have\ngenerally been replaced by dietary imbalances or excess-es associated with many of the leading causes of deathand disability. Overnutrition results from eating toomuch, eating too many of the wrong things, not exercis-ing enough, or taking too many vitamins or other dietaryreplacements.\nRisk of overnutrition is also increased by being more\nthan 20% overweight, consuming a diet high in fat andsalt, and taking high doses of:\n• nicotinic acid (niacin) to lower elevated cholesterol lev-\nels\n• vitamin B\n6to relieve premenstrual syndrome\n• vitamin A to clear up skin problems\n• iron or other trace minerals not prescribed by a doctor\nNutritional disorders can affect any system in the\nbody and the senses of sight, taste, and smell. Malnutri-tion begins with changes in nutrient levels in blood andtissues. Alterations in enzyme levels, tissue abnormali-ties, and organ malfunction may be followed by illnessand death.\nCauses and symptoms\nPoverty and lack of food are the primary reasons\nwhy malnutrition occurs in the United States. Ten per-cent of all members of low income households do notalways have enough healthful food to eat, and malnutri-tion affects one in four elderly Americans. Protein-ener-gy malnutrition occurs in 50% of surgical patients and in48% of all other hospital patients.\nThere is an increased risk of malnutrition associated\nwith chronic diseases, especially disease of the intestinaltract, kidneys, and liver. Patients with chronic diseaseslike cancer ,AIDS , and intestinal disorders may lose\nweight rapidly and become susceptible to undernourish-ment because they cannot absorb valuable vitamins,\ncalories, and iron.\nPeople with drug or alcohol dependencies are also at\nincreased risk of malnurtrition. These people tend tomaintain inadequate diets for long periods of time and\ntheir ability to absorb nutrients is impaired by the alcoholor drug’s affect on body tissues, particularly the liver,pancreas, and brain.\nUnintentionally losing 10 pounds or more may be a\nsign of malnutrition. People who are malnourished may beskinny or bloated. Their skin is pale, thick, dry, and bruises\neasily. Rashes and changes in pigmentation are common.\nHair is thin, tightly curled, and pulls out easily.\nJoints ache and bones are soft and tender. The gumsbleed. The tongue may be swollen or shriveled andcracked. Visual disturbances include night blindness andincreased sensitivity to light and glare.\nOther symptoms of malnutrition include:\n• anemia• diarrhea\n• disorientation\n• goiter (enlarged thyroid gland)• loss of reflexes and lack of coordination• muscle twitches• scaling and cracking of the lips and mouth\nMalnourished children may be short for their age,\nthin, listless, and have weakened immune systems.\nDiagnosis\nOverall appearance, behavior, body-fat distribution,\nand organ function can alert a family physician, internist, ornutrition specialist to the presence of malnutrition.\nPatients may be asked to record what they eat during a spe-cific period. X rays can determine bone density and revealgastrointestinal disturbances, and heart and lung damage.\nBlood and urine tests are used to measure levels of\nvitamins, minerals, and waste products. Nutritional sta-tus can also be determined by:\n• comparing a patient’s weight to standardized charts• calculating body mass index (BMI) according to a for-\nmula that divides height into weight\n• measuring skin-fold thickness or the circumference of\nthe upper arm\nTreatment\nNormalizing nutritional status starts with a nutrition-\nal assessment. This process enables a clinical nutritionist\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2104Malnutritionor registered dietician to confirm the presence of malnu-\ntrition, assess the effects of the disorder, and formulatediets that will restore adequate nutrition.\nPatients who cannot or will not eat, or who are unable\nto absorb nutrients taken by mouth, may be fed intra-venously (parenteral nutrition) or through a tube insertedinto the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (enteral nutrition).\nTube feeding is often used to provide nutrients to\npatients who have suffered burns or who have inflamma-\ntory bowel disease. This procedure involves inserting athin tube through the nose and carefully guiding it alongthe throat until it reaches the stomach or small intestine.If long-term tube feeding is necessary, the tube may beplaced directly into the stomach or small intestinethrough an incision in the abdomen.\nTube feeding cannot always deliver adequate nutri-\nents to patients who:\n• are severely malnourished\n• require surgery• are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatments\n• have been seriously burned• have persistent diarrhea or vomiting• whose gastrointestinal tract is paralyzed\nIntravenous feeding can supply some or all of the\nnutrients these patients need.\nPrognosis\nUp to 10% of a person’s body weight can be lost\nwithout side effects, but if more than 40% is lost, the sit-uation is almost always fatal. Death usually results fromheart failure , electrolyte imbalance, or low body tem-\nperature. Patients with semiconsciousness, persistentdiarrhea, jaundice , or low blood sodium levels have a\npoorer prognosis.\nSome children with protein-energy malnutrition\nrecover completely. Others have many health problemsthroughout life, including mental retardation and the\ninability to absorb nutrients through the intestinal tract.Prognosis for all patients with malnutrition seems to bedependent on the age of the patient, and the length andseverity of the malnutrition, with young children and theelderly having the highest rate of long-term complica-tions and death.\nPrevention\nBreastfeeding a baby for at least six months is con-\nsidered the best way to prevent early-childhood malnutri-tion. The United States Department of Agriculture andHealth and Human Service recommend that all Ameri-\ncans over the age of two:\n• consume plenty of fruits, grains, and vegetables\n• eat a variety of foods that are low in fats and choles-\nterols and contain only moderate amounts of salt, sug-ars, and sodium\n• engage in moderate physical activity for at least 30\nminutes, at least several times a week\n• achieve or maintain their ideal weight\n• use alcohol sparingly or avoid it altogether\nEvery patient admitted to a hospital should be\nscreened for the presence of illnesses and conditions thatcould lead to protein-energy malnutrition. Patients withhigher-than-average risk for malnutrition should be moreclosely assessed and reevaluated often during long-termhospitalization or nursing-home care.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAndersen, Jean, and Barbara Deskins.

    "title": "Malocclusion",
    "content": "Malocclusion\nDefinition\nMalocclusion is a problem in the way the upper and\nlower teeth fit together in biting or chewing. The wordmalocclusion literally means “bad bite.” The condition\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2105Malocclusionmay also be referred to as an irregular bite, crossbite, or\noverbite.\nDescription\nMalocclusion may be seen as crooked, crowded, or\nprotruding teeth. It may affect a person’s appearance,speech, and/or ability to eat.\nCauses and symptoms\nMalocclusions are most often inherited, but may be\nacquired. Inherited conditions include too many or toofew teeth, too much or too little space between teeth,irregular mouth and jaw size and shape, and atypical for-mations of the jaws and face, such as a cleft palate. Mal-occlusions may be acquired from habits like finger orthumb sucking, tongue thrusting, premature loss of teethfrom an accident or dental disease, and medical condi-tions such as enlarged tonsils and adenoids that lead tomouth breathing.\nMalocclusions may be symptomless or they may\nproduce pain from increased stress on the oral struc-\ntures. Teeth may show abnormal signs of wear on thechewing surfaces or decay in areas of tight overlap.Chewing may be difficult.\nDiagnosis\nMalocclusion is most often found during a routine\ndental examination. A dentist will check a patient’socclusion by watching how the teeth make contact\nwhen the patient bites down normally. The dentist mayask the patient to bite down with a piece of coatedpaper between the upper and lower teeth; this paperwill leave colored marks at the points of contact. Whenmalocclusion is suspected, photographs and x rays ofthe face and mouth may be taken for further study. Toconfirm the presence and extent of malocclusion, thedentist makes plaster, plastic, or artificial stone modelsof the patient’s teeth from impressions. These modelsduplicate the fit of the teeth and are very useful intreatment planning.\nTreatment\nMalocclusion may be remedied by orthodontic treat-\nment; orthodontics is a specialty of dentistry that man-ages the growth and correction of dental and facial struc-tures. Braces are the most commonly used orthodonticappliances in the treatment of malocclusion. At any giventime, approximately 4 million people in the United Statesare wearing braces, including 800,000 adults.\nBraces apply constant gentle force to slowly\nchange the position of the teeth, straightening them andproperly aligning them with the opposing teeth. Bracesconsist of brackets cemented to the surface of eachtooth and wires of stainless steel or nickel titaniumalloy. When the wires are threaded through the brack-ets, they exert pressure against the teeth, causing themto gradually move.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2106Malocclusion\nOrthodontia treatments usually include the use of braces\nand retainers. (Photograph by Lester V. Bergman, Corbis\nImages. Reproduced by permission).\nThis patient’s teeth are misarranged because of excessive\nthumb sucking. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\npermission.)Braces are not removable for daily tooth brushing, so\nthe patient must be especially diligent about keeping themouth clean and removing food particles which becomeeasily trapped, to prevent tooth decay . Foods that are\ncrunchy should be avoided to minimize the risk of break-ing the appliance. Hard fruits, vegetables, and breadsmust be cut into bite-sized pieces before eating. Foodsthat are sticky, including chewing gum, should be avoidedbecause they may pull off the brackets or weaken thecement. Carbonated beverages may also weaken thecement, as well as contribute to tooth decay. Teeth shouldbe brushed immediately after eating sweet foods. Specialfloss threaders are available to make flossing easier.\nIf overcrowding is creating malocclusion, one or\nmore teeth may be extracted (surgically removed), givingthe others room to move. If a tooth has not yet erupted oris prematurely lost, the orthodontist may insert an appli-ance called a space maintainer to keep the other teethfrom moving out of their natural position. In severe casesof malocclusion, surgery may be necessary and thepatient would be referred to yet another specialist, anoral or maxillofacial surgeon.\nOnce the teeth have been moved into their new posi-\ntion, the braces are removed and a retainer is worn untilthe teeth stabilize in that position. Retainers do not moveteeth, they only hold them in place.\nOrthodontic treatment is the only effective treatment\nfor malocclusion not requiring surgery. However,depending on the cause and severity of the condition, anorthodontist may be able to suggest other appliances asalternatives to braces.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are some techniques of craniosacral therapy\nthat can alter structure. This therapy may allow correctionof some cases of malocclusion. If surgery is required, pre-and post-surgical care with homeopathic remedies, aswell as vitamin and mineral supplements, can enhancerecovery. Night guards are sometimes recommended toease the strain on the jaw and to limit teeth grinding.\nPrognosis\nDepending on the cause and severity of the maloc-\nclusion and the appliance used in treatment, a patientmay expect correction of the condition to take 2 or moreyears. Patients typically wear braces 18-24 months and aretainer for another year. Treatment is faster and moresuccessful in children and teens whose teeth and bonesare still developing. The length of treatment time is alsoaffected by how well the patient follows orthodonticinstructions.KEY TERMS\nBraces —An orthodontic appliance consisting or\nbrackets cemented to the surface of each toothand wires of stainless steel or nickel titanium alloy.Braces are used to treat malocclusion by changingthe position of the teeth.\nImpression —An imprint of the upper or lower\nteeth made in a pliable material that sets.

    "title": "MALT lymphoma",
    "content": "MALT lymphoma\nDefinition\nMALT lymphomas are solid tumors that originate\nfrom cancerous growth of immune cells that are recruited\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2107MALT lymphomato secretory tissue such as the gastrointestinal tract, sali-\nvary glands, lungs, and the thyroid gland.\nDescription\nThe digestive tract is generally not associated with\nlymphoid tissue, with the exception of small collectionsof lymphocytes such as Peyer’s patches. A specific kindof white blood cell, B-lymphocytes, can accumulate inresponse to infections of the digestive tract and othersecretory tissues, or as a result of autoimmune conditionssuch as Sj”gren’s syndrome. When the growth of theselymphocytes is maintained through continued infectionor autoimmune disease, a malignant cell can arise andreplace the normal lymphocytes. These lymphomas,derived from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue(MALT), most commonly arise in the stomach. Theirgrowth seems to be dependent upon continuous stimula-tion of the immune system by an infectious agent, suchas H. pylori, or some other entity, termed an antigen, thatthe body recognizes as foreign. This antigen-drivengrowth permits these tumors to be treated by eliminatingthe stimulus that generated the original, normal immuneresponse. In the stomach they are associated, in greaterthan 90% of all cases, with the bacteria called Helicobac-ter pylori (H. pylori). This bacteria is also associatedwith peptic stomach irritation, ulcers, and gastric cancer .\nMALT lymphomas are generally indolent, that is, theygrow slowly and cause little in the way of symptoms.Those MALT lymphomas that arise in the stomach inresponse to H. pylori infections are generally successful-ly treated with antibiotics , which eliminate the bacteria.\nDemographics\nMALT lymphomas occur at a frequency of about 1.5\nper 100,000 people per year in the United States andaccount for about 10% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.The frequency varies among different populations. Forexample, in parts of Italy the frequency of MALT lym-phomas is as high as 13 per 100,000 people per year.This can in part be attributed to different rates of infec-tion with H. pylori. However, other hereditary, dietary, orenvironmental factors are almost certainly involved.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe majority of MALT lymphomas appear to be the\nresult of infectious agents, most commonly H. pylori inthe stomach. It is not known if infectious agents alsocause MALT lymphomas outside of the stomach. Insome cases, such as in the thyroid, MALT lymphomasseem to arise in patients who have autoimmune diseases,which make their immune systems treat their own tissueas foreign or antigenic. It is believed that there must beadditional factors, in addition to infection or autoimmu-\nnity, that influence the development of MALT lym-phomas. For example, in the United States, where infec-tions with H. pylori are quite common, less than 1 in30,000 people who have H. pylori in their stomachsdevelop MALT lymphomas. In addition, individuals whodevelop MALT lymphomas are more likely to developother forms of cancer. This would suggest that theremight be genetic factors predisposing individuals todevelop MALT lymphomas or other tumors in responseto environmental or infectious agents.\nIn general, patients have stomach pain , ulcers, or\nother localized symptoms, but rarely do they suffer fromsystemic complaints such as fatigue or fever .\nDiagnosis\nThe indolent nature of most MALT lymphomas\nmeans that the majority of patients are diagnosed at earlystages with relatively nonspecific symptoms. In the caseof gastric MALT lymphomas, the physician will thenhave a gastroenterologist perform an endoscopy to exam-ine the interior of the stomach. MALT lymphomas arethen recognized as areas of inflammation or ulcerationwithin the stomach. It is unusual for masses recognizableas tumors to be seen upon examination. Definitive diag-nosis of MALT lymphoma requires a biopsy, in which abit of tissue is removed from the stomach or otherinvolved site. Examination of this tissue by a pathologistis the first step in distinguishing among the possible diag-noses of inflammation, indolent lymphoma, or a moreaggressive form of cancer, such as gastric cancer or arapidly growing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The patholo-gist evaluates the type of lymphoid cells that are presentin the biopsy to establish the nature of the lesion. In addi-tion, it is essential that the pathologist determine whetheror not the lymphoma has grown beyond the borders of themucosa, which lines the stomach or other gland.\nTreatment\nThe best staging system to employ for MALT lym-\nphomas is still the subject of discussion. However, it isstandard practice that patients presenting with MALTlymphomas should be evaluated in a similar manner toindividuals with nodal lymphomas, the more commontype of lymphoma that originates at sites within the lym-phoid system. These procedures include a complete his-tory and physical, blood tests, chest x rays, and bonemarrow biopsy. This evaluation will permit the oncolo-gist to determine if the disease is localized or if it hasspread to other sites within the body.\nIn general, the prognosis for patients with MALT\nlymphomas is good, with overall five-year survival rates\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2108MALT lymphomathat are greater than 80%. The features that are most\nclosely related to the outlook for newly diagnosed indi-vidual patients are: whether the primary site is in thestomach or is extra-gastric; if the disease has spreadbeyond the initial location; and whether the histologicevaluation of the initial tumor biopsies is consistent with alow-grade, slowly growing lesion, as compared to a high-grade lesion that is more rapidly growing. In general, thehistologic grade is the most important feature, with high-grade lesions requiring the most aggressive treatment.\nTreatment of MALT lymphomas differs from that of\nmost lymphomas. In the most common type of MALTlymphomas—low-grade lesions originating in the stom-ach—treatment with antibiotics to eliminate H. pylorileads to complete remissions in the majority of patients.The effectiveness of this treatment is indistinguishablefrom surgery, chemotherapy ,radiation therapy , or a\ncombination of surgery with drugs or irradiation.Approximately one-third of patients in this group haveevidence of disseminated disease, where lymphoma cellsare detected at sites in addition to the gastric mucosa.The response of these patients to antibiotic treatment isnot significantly different from that for individuals withlocalized disease. For both groups a complete remissionis achieved in about 75% of patients, who remain, onaverage, free of disease for about 5 years.\nPrognosis\nPatients with MALT lymphomas arising outside of\nthe digestive tract also have good prognoses. Effectivetreatment for these lymphomas has been achieved withlocal radiation, chemotherapy, and/or interferon. Surgeryfollowed by chemotherapy or radiation is also effectivewith nongastrointestinal MALT lymphomas. Overall thesepatients have five-year survival rates greater than 90%.\nWhile the outlook for patients with MALT lym-\nphomas is good, difficulties in diagnosis and staginghave left the optimal treatment a matter of continuedstudy. This is an especially open question for thosepatients who fail to respond to antibiotic therapy, orwhose disease recurs. It may be the case that in thesepatients, the MALT lymphoma may have already pro-gressed to a point where high-grade lesions, not observedin the original biopsies, were resistant to the initial treat-ment. The best treatment for these patients remains to beestablished. In general, these patients are treated withchemotherapy in a similar manner to patients with othertypes of lymphoma. Given the success of antibiotics, andthe good prognosis for gastric MALT lymphomas in gen-eral, no sufficient body of evidence exists to determinethe best chemotherapy for patients who fail to achieve acomplete and lasting remission upon initial treatment.

The aspects of treatment beingaddressed are the most effective antibiotics and the use ofantacids to modulate irritation in the stomach. These\nprotocols have been designed to follow the natural histo-ry of gastric lymphomas and to establish the biologicalfeatures that predict treatment response to antibiotics andduration of remission.\nPrevention\nThere are currently no commonly accepted means to\nprevent MALT lymphomas.

    "title": "Mammography",
    "content": "Mammography\nDefinition\nMammography is the study of the breast using x ray.\nThe actual test is called a mammogram. There are twotypes of mammograms. A screening mammogram isordered for women who have no problems with theirbreasts. It consists of two x-ray views of each breast. Adiagnostic mammogram is for evaluation of new abnor-malities or of patients with a past abnormality requiringfollow-up (i.e. a woman with breast cancer treated with\nlumpectomy ). Additional x rays from other angles or\nspecial views of certain areas are taken.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of screening mammography is breast\ncancer detection. A screening test, by definition, is used\nfor patients without any signs or symptoms in order todetect disease as early as possible. Many studies haveshown that having regular mammograms increases awoman’s chances of finding breast cancer in an earlystage, when it is more likely to be curable. It has beenestimated that a mammogram may find a cancer as muchas two years before it can be felt. The American CancerSociety, American College of Radiology, American Col-lege of Surgeons and American Medical Association rec-ommend annual mammograms for every woman begin-ning at age 40.\nScreening mammograms are not usually recom-\nmended for women under age 40 who have no special riskfactors and a normal physical breast examination. Belowage 40, breasts tend to be “radiographically dense,” whichmeans it is difficult to see many details. But some differ-ences of opinion exist about the usefulness of screeningwomen between the ages of 40-50. While screening mam-mograms at 40 can detect cancers in an early stage, somehealth care providers worry about the increased negative(benign) biopsy rate in this age group.\nSome women are at increased risk for developing\nbreast cancer, such as those with multiple relatives whohave the disease. Beginning screening mammography ata younger age—generally 10 years younger than theyoungest affected relative, but not less than 35 years ofage—may be recommended for these women.\nDiagnostic mammography is used to evaluate an\nexisting problem, such as a lump, discharge from the nip-ple, or unusual tenderness in one area. The cause of theproblem may be definitively diagnosed from this study,but further investigation using other methods may benecessary. This test is also used to evaluate findings fromscreening mammography tests.\nDescription\nA mammogram may be offered in a variety of set-\ntings. Hospitals, outpatient clinics, physician’s offices, orother facilities may have mammography equipment. Inthe United States, since October 1, 1994, only places cer-tified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) arelegally permitted to perform, interpret, or develop mam-mograms.\nIn addition to the usual paperwork, a woman will be\nasked to fill out a form seeking information relevant toher risk of breast cancer and special mammographyneeds. The woman is asked about personal and familyhistory of cancer, details about menstruation, child bear-ing, birth control, breast implants , other breast surgery,\nage, and hormone replacement therapy . Information\nabout Breast Self Examination (BSE) and other breasthealth issues are usually available at no charge.\nAt some centers, a technologist may perform a\nphysical examination of the breasts before the mammo-\ngram. Whether or not this is done, it is essential for thepatient to tell the technologist about any lumps, nippledischarge, breast pain , or other concerns.\nClothing from the waist up is removed and a hospital\ngown or similar covering is put on. The woman standsfacing the mammography machine. The technologistexposes one breast and places it on a plastic or metal filmholder about the size of a placemat. The breast is com-pressed as flat as possible between the film holder and arectangle of plastic (called a paddle), which pressesdown onto the breast from above. The compressionshould only last a few seconds, just enough to take the x\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2110Mammographyray. Good compression can be uncomfortable, but it is\nnecessary to ensure the clearest view of all breast tissues.\nNext, the woman is positioned with her side toward\nthe mammography unit. The film holder is tilted so theoutside of the breast rests against it, and a corner touch-es the armpit. The paddle again holds the breast firmlyas the x ray is taken. This procedure is repeated for theother breast. A total of four x rays, two of each breast,are taken for a screening mammogram. Additional xrays, using special paddles, different breast positions,or other techniques are usually taken for a diagnosticmammogram.\nThe mammogram may be seen and interpreted by a\nradiologist right away, or it may not be reviewed untillater. If there are any questionable areas or an abnormali-ty, extra x rays may be recommended. These may betaken during the same appointment. More commonly,especially for screening mammograms, the woman iscalled back on another day for these additional films.\nA screening mammogram usually takes approxi-\nmately 15 to 30 minutes. A woman having a diagnosticmammogram can expect to spend up to an hour at themammography facility.\nThe cost of mammography varies widely. Many\nmammography facilities accept “self referral.” Thismeans women can schedule themselves without a physi-cian’s referral. However, some insurance policies dorequire a doctor’s prescription to ensure payment.Medicare will pay for annual screening mammogramsfor all women with Medicare who are age 40 or older anda baseline mammogram for those age 35 to 39.\nA digital mammogram is performed in the same way\nas a traditional exam, but in addition to the image beingrecorded on film, it is viewed on a computer monitor andstored as a digital file.\nPreparation\nThe compression or squeezing of the breast neces-\nsary for a mammogram is a concern of many women.Mammograms should be scheduled when a woman’sbreasts are least likely to be tender.

    "title": "Mania",
    "content": "Mania\nDefinition\nMania is an abnormally elated mental state, typically\ncharacterized by feelings of euphoria, lack of inhibitions,racing thoughts, diminished need for sleep, talkativeness,risk taking, and irritability. In extreme cases, mania caninduce hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms.\nDescription\nMania typically occurs as a symptom of bipolar dis-\norder (a mood disorder characterized by both manic and\ndepressive episodes). Individuals experiencing a manicepisode often have feelings of self-importance, elation,talkativeness, sociability, and a desire to embark on goal-oriented activities, coupled with the less desirable charac-teristics of irritability, impatience, impulsiveness, hyperac-tivity, and a decreased need for sleep. (Note: Hypomania isa term applied to a condition resembling mania. It is char-acterized by persistent or elevated expansive mood, hyper-activity, inflated self esteem, etc., but of less intensity thanmania.) Severe mania may have psychotic features.\nCauses and symptoms\nMania can be induced by the use or abuse of stimu-\nlant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. It is also\nthe predominant feature of bipolar disorder, or manicdepression, an affective mental illness that causes radicalemotional changes and mood swings.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders, Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ), the diagnostic stan-\ndard for mental health professionals in the U.S.,describes a manic episode as an abnormally elevatedmood lasting at least one week that is distinguished by atleast three of the following symptoms: inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racingthoughts, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activi-ty, or excessive involvement in pleasurable activities thathave a high potential for painful consequences. If themood of the patient is irritable and not elevated, four ofthese symptoms are required.\nDiagnosis\nMania is usually diagnosed and treated by a psychia-\ntrist and/or a psychologist in an outpatient setting. How-ever, most severely manic patients require hospitaliza-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2112Maniation. In addition to an interview, several clinical invento-\nries or scales may be used to assess the patient’s mentalstatus and determine the presence and severity of mania.An assessment commonly includes the Young ManiaRating Scale (YMRS). The Mini-Mental State Examina-tion (MMSE) may also be given to screen out other ill-nesses such as dementia .\nTreatment\nMania is primarily treated with drugs. The following\nmood-stabilizing agents are commonly prescribed to reg-ulate manic episodes:\n• Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane) is one of the\noldest and most frequently prescribed drugs availablefor the treatment of mania. Because the drug takes fourto seven days to reach a therapeutic level in the blood-stream, it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction withneuroleptics ( antipsychotic drugs ) and/or benzodi-\nazepines (tranquilizers) to provide more immediate\nrelief of mania.\n• Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant\ndrug usually prescribed in conjunction with othermood-stabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treatbipolar patients who have not responded well to lithiumtherapy. As of early 1998, carbamazepine was notapproved for the treatment of mania by the FDA.\n• Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic\nacid, or Depakene) is an anticonvulsant drug prescribedalone or in combination with carbamazepine and/orlithium. For patients experiencing “mixed mania,” ormania with features of depression, valproate is pre-ferred over lithium.\nClozapine (Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychotic\nmedication used to control manic episodes in patientswho have not responded to typical mood-stabilizingagents. The drug has also been a useful preventativetreatment in some bipolar patients. Other new anticon-vulsants (lamotrigine, gubapentin) are being investigatedfor treatment of mania and bipolar disorder.\nPrognosis\nPatients experiencing mania as a result of bipolar\ndisorder will require long-term care to prevent recur-rence; bipolar disorder is a chronic condition thatrequires lifelong observation and treatment after diagno-sis. Data show that almost 90% of patients who experi-ence one manic episode will go on to have another.\nPrevention\nMania as a result of bipolar disorder can only be pre-\nvented through ongoing pharmacologic treatment.KEY TERMS\nHypomania —A less severe form of elevated\nmood state that is a characteristic of bipolar typeII disorder.\nMixed mania —A mental state in which symptoms\nof both depression and mania occur simultane-ously.\nPatient education in the form of therapy or self-help\ngroups is crucial for training patients to recognize signsof mania and to take an active part in their treatment pro-gram.

    "title": "Marfan syndrome",
    "content": "Marfan syndrome\nDefinition\nMarfan syndrome is an inherited disorder of the con-\nnective tissue that causes abnormalities of the patient’seyes, cardiovascular system, and musculoskeletal sys-tem. It is named for the French pediatrician, AntoineMarfan (1858–1942), who first described it in 1896.Marfan syndrome is sometimes called arachnodactyly,which means “spider-like fingers” in Greek, since one ofthe characteristic signs of the disease is disproportionate-ly long fingers and toes. It is estimated that one person inevery 3,000-5,000 has Marfan syndrome, or about50,000 people in the United States. Marfan syndrome isone of the more common inheritable disorders.\nDescription\nMarfan syndrome affects three major organ systems\nof the body: the heart and circulatory system, the bonesand muscles, and the eyes. The genetic mutation respon-sible for Marfan was discovered in 1991. It affects thebody’s production of fibrillin, which is a protein that isan important part of connective tissue. Fibrillin is the pri-mary component of the microfibrils that allow tissues tostretch repeatedly without weakening. Because thepatient’s fibrillin is abnormal, his or her connective tis-sues are looser than usual, which weakens or damagesthe support structures of the entire body.\nThe most common external signs associated with\nMarfan syndrome include excessively long arms andlegs, with the patient’s arm span being greater than his orher height. The fingers and toes may be long and slender,with loose joints that can be bent beyond their normallimits. This unusual flexibility is called hypermobility.The patient’s face may also be long and narrow, and he orshe may have a noticeable curvature of the spine. It isimportant to note, however, that Marfan patients varywidely in the external signs of their disorder and in theirseverity; even two patients from the same family maylook quite different. Most of the external features of Mar-fan syndrome become more pronounced as the patientgets older, so that diagnosis of the disorder is often easierin adults than in children. In many cases, the patient mayhave few or very minor outward signs of the disorder,and the diagnosis may be missed until the patient devel-ops vision problems or cardiac symptoms.\nMarfan syndrome by itself does not affect a person’s\nintelligence or ability to learn. There is, however, someclinical evidence that children with Marfan have a slight-ly higher rate of hyperactivity and attention-deficit disor-der (ADD) than the general population. In addition, achild with undiagnosed nearsightedness related to Mar-fan may have difficulty seeing the blackboard or readingprinted materials, and thus do poorly in school.\nMarfan syndrome affects males and females equally,\nand appears to be distributed equally among all races andethnic groups. The rate of mutation of the fibrillin gene,however, appears to be related to the age of the patient’sfather; older fathers are more likely to have new muta-tions appear in chromosome 15.\nCauses and symptoms\nMarfan syndrome is caused by a single gene for fib-\nrillin on chromosome 15, which is inherited in mostcases from an affected parent. Between 15 and 25% ofcases result from spontaneous mutations. Mutations ofthe fibrillin gene (FBNI) are unique to each familyaffected by Marfan, which makes rapid genetic diagnosisimpossible, given present technology. The syndrome isan autosomal dominant disorder, which means thatsomeone who has it has a 50% chance of passing it on toany offspring.\nAnother important genetic characteristic of Marfan\nsyndrome is variable expression. This term means thatthe mutated fibrillin gene can produce a variety of symp-toms of very different degrees of severity, even in mem-bers of the same family.\nCardiac and circulatory abnormalities\nThe most important complications of Marfan are\nthose affecting the heart and major blood vessels; someare potentially life-threatening. About 90% of Marfanpatients will develop cardiac complications.\n• Aortic enlargement. This is the most serious potential\ncomplication of Marfan syndrome. Because of theabnormalities of the patient’s fibrillin, the walls of theaorta (the large blood vessel that carries blood awayfrom the heart) are weaker than normal and tend to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2114Marfan syndromestretch and bulge out of shape. This stretching increases\nthe likelihood of an aortic dissection , which is a tear or\nseparation between the layers of tissue that make up theaorta. An aortic dissection usually causes severe pain in\nthe abdomen, back, or chest, depending on the sectionof the aorta that is affected. Rupture of the aorta is amedical emergency requiring immediate surgery andmedication.\n• Aortic regurgitation. A weakened and enlarged aorta\nmay allow some blood to leak back into the heart dur-ing each heartbeat; this condition is called aortic regur-gitation. Aortic regurgitation occasionally causesshortness of breath during normal activity. In serious\ncases, it causes the left ventricle of the heart to enlargeand may eventually lead to heart failure.\n•Mitral valve prolapse . Between 75 and 85% of Mar-\nfan patients have loose or “floppy” mitral valves, whichare the valves that separate the chambers of the heart.When these valves do not cover the opening betweenthe chambers completely, the condition is called mitralvalve prolapse. Complications of mitral valve prolapseinclude heart murmurs and arrhythmias . In rare\ncases, mitral valve prolapse can cause sudden death.\n• Infective endocarditis . Infective endocarditis is an\ninfection of the endothelium, the tissue that lines theheart. In patients with Marfan, it is the abnormal mitralvalve that is most likely to become infected.\n• Other complications. Some patients with Marfan devel-\nop cystic disease of the lungs or recurrent spontaneouspneumothorax , which is a condition in which air accu-\nmulates in the space around the lungs. Many will alsoeventually develop emphysema .\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities\nMarfan syndrome causes an increase in the length of\nthe patient’s bones, with decreased support from the liga-ments that hold the bones together. As a result, the patientmay develop various deformities of the skeleton or disor-ders related to the relative looseness of the ligaments.\nDisorders of the spine\n•Scoliosis . Scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, is a disor-\nder in which the vertebrae that make up the spine twistout of line from side to side into an S-shape or a spiral.It is caused by a combination of the rapid growth ofchildren with Marfan, and the looseness of the liga-ments that help the spine to keep its shape.\n•Kyphosis is an abnormal outward curvature of the\nspine at the back, sometimes called hunch back when itoccurs in the upper back. Marfan patients may developkyphosis either in the upper (thoracic) spine or the\nlower (lumbar) spine.\n• Spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis is the medical\nterm for a forward slippage of one vertebra on the onebelow it. It produces an ache or stiffness in the lowerback.\n• Dural ectasia. The dura is the tough, fibrous outermost\nmembrane covering the brain and the spinal cord. Theweak dura in Marfan patients swells or bulges under thepressure of the spinal fluid. This swelling is called ecta-sia. In most cases, dural ectasia occurs in the lowerspine, producing low back ache, a burning feeling, ornumbness or weakness in the legs.\nDisorders of the chest and lower body\n• Pectus excavatum. Pectus excavatum is a malformation\nof the chest in which the patient’s breastbone, or ster-num, is sunken inward. It can cause difficulties inbreathing, especially if the heart, spine, and lung havebeen affected by Marfan. It also usually causes con-cerns about appearance.\n• Pectus carinatum. In other patients with Marfan the ster-\nnum is pushed outward and narrowed. Although pectuscarinatum does not cause breathing difficulties, it cancause embarassment about appearance. A few patientswith Marfan may have a pectus excavatum on one sideof their chest and a pectus carinatum on the other.\n• Foot disorders. Patients with Marfan are more likely to\ndevelop pes planus (flat feet) or so-called “claw” or“hammer” toes than people in the general population.They are also more likely to suffer from chronic pain intheir feet.\n• Protrusio acetabulae. The acetabulum is the socket of\nthe hip joint. In patient’s with Marfan, the acetabulumbecomes deeper than normal during growth, for reasonsthat are not yet understood. Although protrusio acetabu-lae does not cause problems during childhood and ado-lescence, it can lead to a painful form of arthritis inadult life.\nDisorders of the eyes and face\nAlthough the visual problems that are related to\nMarfan syndrome are rarely life-threatening, they areimportant in that they may be the patient’s first indicationof the disorder. Eye disorders related to the syndromeinclude the following:\n• Myopia (nearsightedness). Most patients with Marfan\ndevelop nearsightedness, usually in childhood.\n• Ectopia lentis. Ectopia lentis is the medical term for\ndislocation of the lens of the eye. Between 65 and 75%\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2115Marfan syndromeof Marfan patients have dislocated lenses. This condi-\ntion is an important indication for diagnosis of the syn-drome because there are relatively few other disordersthat produce it.\n•Glaucoma . This condition is much more prevalent in\npatients with Marfan syndrome than in the general pop-ulation.\n•Cataracts . Patients with Marfan are more likely to\ndevelop cataracts, and to develop them much earlier inlife, sometimes as early as 40 years of age.\n•Retinal detachment . Patients with Marfan are more\nvulnerable to this disorder because of the weakness oftheir connective tissues. Untreated retinal detachmentcan cause blindness. The danger of retinal detachmentis an important reason for patients to avoid contactsports or other activities that could cause a blow on thehead or being knocked to the ground.\n• Other facial problems. Patients with Marfan sometimes\ndevelop dental problems related to crowding of theteeth caused by a high-arched palate and a narrow jaw.\nOther disorders\n• Striae. Striae are stretch marks in the skin caused by\nrapid weight gain or growth; they frequently occur inpregnant women, for example. Marfan patients oftendevelop striae over the shoulders, hips, and lower backat an early age because of rapid bone growth. Althoughthe patient may be self-conscious about the striae, theyare not a danger to health.\n• Obstructive sleep apnea . Obstructive sleep apnea refers\nto partial obstruction of the airway during sleep, caus-ing irregular breathing and somet imes snoring . In\npatients with Marfan, obstructive sleep apnea is causedby the unusual flexibility of the tissues lining thepatient’s airway. This disturbed breathing patternincreases the risk of aortic dissection.\nDiagnosis\nPresently, there is no objective diagnostic test for\nMarfan syndrome, in part because the disorder does notproduce any measurable biochemical changes in thepatient’s blood or body fluids, or cellular changes thatcould be detected from a tissue sample. Althoughresearchers in molecular biology are currently investigat-ing the FBNI gene through a process called mutationalanalysis, it is presently not useful as a diagnostic testbecause there is evidence that there can be mutations inthe fibrillin gene that do not produce Marfan. Similarly,there is no reliable prenatal test, although some physi-cians have used ultrasound to try to determine the lengthof fetal limbs in at-risk pregnancies.The diagnosis is made by taking a family history and\na thorough examination of the patient’s eyes, heart, andbone structure. The examination should include anechocardiogram taken by a cardiologist, a slit-lamp eye\nexamination by an ophthalmologist, and a work-up of\nthe patient’s spinal column by an orthopedic specialist.In terms of the cardiac examination, a standard electro-cardiogram (EKG) is not sufficient for diagnosis; onlythe echocardiogram can detect possible enlargement ofthe aorta. The importance of the slit-lamp examination isthat it allows the doctor to detect a dislocated lens, whichis a significant indication of the syndrome.\nThe symptoms of Marfan syndrome in some patients\nresemble the symptoms of homocystinuria, which is aninherited disorder marked by extremely high levels ofhomocystine in the patient’s blood and urine. This possi-bility can be excluded by a urine test.\nIn other cases, the diagnosis remains uncertain\nbecause of the mildness of the patient’s symptoms, theabsence of a family history of the syndrome, and othervariables. These borderline conditions are sometimesreferred to as marfanoid syndromes.\nTreatment\nThe treatment and management of Marfan is tailored\nto the specific symptoms of each patient. Some patientsfind that the syndrome has little impact on their overalllifestyle; others have found their lives centered on thedisorder.\nCardiovascular system\nAfter a person has been diagnosed with Marfan, he\nor she should be monitored with an echocardiogramevery six months until it is clear that the aorta is notgrowing larger. After that, the patient should have anechocardiogram once a year. If the echocardiogram doesnot allow the physician to visualize all portions of theaorta, CT (computed tomography) or MRI ( magnetic\nresonance imaging ) may be used. In cases involving a\npossible aortic dissection, the patient may be given aTEE (transesophageal echocardiogram).\nMedications. A Marfan patient may be given drugs\ncalled beta-blockers to slow down the rate of aorticenlargement and decrease the risk of dissection by lower-ing the blood pressure and decreasing the forcefulness ofthe heartbeat. The most commonly used beta-blockers inMarfan patients are propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol(Tenormin). Patients who are allergic to beta-blockersmay be given a calcium blocker such as verapamil.\nBecause Marfan patients are at increased risk for\ninfective endocarditis, they must take a prophylactic dose\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2116Marfan syndromeof an antibiotic before having dental work or minor\nsurgery, as these procedures may allow bacteria to enterthe bloodstream. Penicillin and amoxicillin are theantibiotics most often used.\nSurgical treatment. Surgery may be necessary if the\nwidth of the patient’s aorta increases rapidly or reachesa critical size (about 2 inches). As of 2000, the mostcommon surgical treatment involves replacing thepatient’s aortic valve and several inches of the aortaitself with a composite graft, which is a prosthetic heartvalve sewn into one end of a Dacron tube. This surgeryhas been performed widely since about 1985; mostpatients who have had a composite graft have not need-ed additional surgery.\nPatients who have had a valve replaced must take an\nanticoagulant medication, usually warfarin (Coumadin),in order to minimize the possibility of a clot forming onthe prosthetic valve.\nMusculoskeletal system\nChildren diagnosed with Marfan should be checked\nfor scoliosis by their pediatricians at each annual physi-\ncal examination . The doctor simply asks the child to\nbend forward while the back is examined for changes inthe curvature. In addition, the child’s spine should be x-rayed in order to measure the extent of scoliosis orkyphosis. The curve is measured in degrees by the anglebetween the vertebrae as seen on the x ray. Curves of 20°or less are not likely to become worse. Curves between20 and 40 degrees are likely to increase in children oradolescents. Curves of 40 degrees or more are highlylikely to worsen, even in an adult, because the spine is sobadly imbalanced that the force of gravity will increasethe curvature.\nScoliosis between 20 and 40 degrees in children is\nusually treated with a back brace. The child must wearthis appliance about 23 hours a day until growth is com-plete. If the spinal curvature increases to 40 or 50degrees, the patient may require surgery in order to pre-vent lung problems, back pain, and further deformity.Surgical treatment of scoliosis involves straightening thespine with metal rods and fusing the vertebrae in thestraightened position.\nSpondylolisthesis is treated with a brace in mild\ncases. If the slippage is more than 30 degrees, the slippedvertebra may require surgical realignment.\nDural ectasia can be distinguished from other causes\nof back pain on an MRI. Mild cases are usually not treat-ed. Medication or spinal shunting to remove some of thespinal fluid are used to treat severe cases.Pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum can be treat-\ned by surgery. In pectus excavatum, the deformed breast-bone and ribs are raised and straightened by a metal bar.After four to six months, the bar is removed in an outpa-tient procedure.\nProtrusio acetabulae may require surgery in adult\nlife to provide the patient with an artificial hip joint, ifthe arthritic pains are severe.\nPain in the feet or limbs is usually treated with a\nmild analgesic such as acetaminophen . Patients with\nMarfan should consider wearing shoes with low heels,special cushions, or orthotic inserts. Foot surgery israrely necessary.\nVisual and dental concerns\nPatients with Marfan should have a thorough eye\nexamination, including a slit-lamp examination, to testfor dislocation of the lens as well as nearsightedness.Dislocation can be treated by a combination of specialglasses and daily use of one percent atropine sulfate oph-thalmic drops, or by surgery.\nBecause patients with Marfan are at increased risk of\nglaucoma, they should have the fluid pressure inside theeye measured every year as part of an eye examination.Glaucoma can be treated with medications or with surgery.\nCataracts are treated with increasing success by\nimplant surgery. It is important, however, to seek treat-ment at medical centers with eye surgeons familiar withthe possible complications of cataract surgery in\npatients with Marfan syndrome.\nAll persons with Marfan should be taught to recognize\nthe signs of retinal detachment (sudden blurring of visionin one eye becoming progressively worse without pain orredness) and to seek professional help immediately.\nChildren with Marfan should be evaluated by their\ndentist at each checkup for crowding of the teeth andpossible misalignment, and referred to an orthodontist ifnecessary.\nAthletic activities and occupational choice. People\nwith Marfan should avoid sports or occupations thatrequire heavy weight lifting, rough physical contact, orrapid changes in atmospheric pressure (e.g., scuba div-ing). Weight lifting increases blood pressure, which inturn may enlarge the aorta. Rough physical contact maycause retinal detachment. Sudden changes in air pressuremay produce pneumothorax. Regular noncompetitivephysical exercise , however, is beneficial for Marfan\npatients. Good choices include brisk walking, shootingbaskets, and slow-paced tennis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2117Marfan syndromeSocial and lifestyle issues\nSmoking . Smoking is particularly harmful for Mar-\nfan patients because it increases their risk of emphysema.\nPregnancy . Until very recently, women with Mar-\nfan were advised not to become pregnant because of therisk of aortic enlargement or dissection. The develop-ment of beta-blockers and echocardiograms, however,allows doctors now to monitor patients throughout preg-nancy. It is recommended that patients have an echocar-diogram during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy.Normal, vaginal delivery is not necessarily more stress-ful than a Caesarian section, but patients in prolongedlabor may be given a Caesarian to reduce strain on theheart. A pregnant woman with Marfan should alsoreceive genetic counseling regarding the 50% risk of\nhaving a child with the syndrome.\nAppearance and Social Concerns.

Many people respond withguilt, fear, or blame when a genetic disorder is diagnosedin the family, or they may overprotect the affected mem-ber. Support groups are often good sources of informa-tion about Marfan; they can offer helpful suggestionsabout living with it as well as emotional support.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for patients with Marfan has\nimproved markedly in recent years. As of 1995, the lifeexpectancy of people with the syndrome has increased to72 years, up from 48 years in 1972. This dramaticimprovement is attributed to new surgical techniques,improved diagnosis, and new techniques of medicaltreatment.\nThe most important single factor in improving the\npatient’s prognosis is early diagnosis. The earlier that apatient can benefit from the new techniques and lifestylemodifications, the more likely he or she is to have alonger life expectancy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBeers, Mark H., and Robert Berkow, eds.

    "content": "Marijuana\nDefinition\nMarijuana (marihuana) Cannabis sativa L. , also\nknown as Indian hemp, is a member of the Cannabaceae orhemp family, thought to have originated in the mountain-ous districts of India, north of the Himalayan mountains.\nDescription\nThe herb was referred to as “hempe” in A.D. 1000 and\nlisted in a dictionary under that English name. Supportersof the notorious Pancho Villa first used the name marijuanain 1895 in Sonora, Mexico. They called the mood-alteringherb they smoked marijuana. The term hashish, is derivedfrom the name for the Saracen soldiers, called hashashins ,\nwho ingested the highly potent cannabis resin before beingsent out to assassinate enemies.\nTwo related species of cannabis are C. ruderalis , and\nC. indica , a variety known as Indian hemp. Indian hemp\ngrows to a height of about 4 ft (1.2 m) and the seed coatshave a marbled appearance.\nThe species C. sativa L. has many variations,\ndepending on the soil, temperature, and light conditions,and the origin of the parent seed. These factors alsoaffect the relative amounts of THC (tetra-hydrocannabi-nol) and cannabidiol, the chemicals present in varyingamounts in cannabis that determine if the plant is primar-ily a fiber type or an intoxicant. Generally the speciesgrown at higher elevations and in hotter climates exudesmore of the resin and is more medicinally potent.\nMarijuana is a somewhat weedy plant and may grow\nas high as 18 ft (5.4 m). The hairy leaves are arrangedopposite one another on the erect and branching stem.Leaves are palmate and compound, deeply divided intofive to seven narrow, toothed and pointed leaflets. Maleand female flowers are small and greenish in color andgrow on separate plants. Male flowers grow in the leafaxils in elongated clusters. The female flowers grow inspike-like clusters. The resinous blossoms have fivesepals and five petals. The male and female blossoms canbe distinguished at maturity. The male plant maturesfirst, shedding its pollen and dying after flowering.Female plants die after dropping the mature seeds. Mari-juana produces an abundance of quickly germinatingseeds. This hardy annual is wind pollinated and hasescaped from cultivation to grow wild along roadsides,trails, stream banks, and in wayside places throughoutthe world. The plant matures within three to five monthsafter the seed has been sown.\nHistory\nMarijuana has been cultivated for thousands of\nyears. Cannabis was first described for its therapeutic usein the first known Chinese pharmacopoeia, the Pen\nTs’ao . (A pharmacopoeia is a book containing a list of\nmedicinal drugs, and their descriptions of preparationand use.) Cannabis was called a “superior” herb by theEmperor Shen-Nung (2737–2697 \nB.C.), who is believed\nto have authored the work. Cannabis was recommendedas a treatment for numerous common ailments. Aroundthat same period in Egypt, cannabis was used as a treat-ment for sore eyes. The herb was used in India in culturaland religious ceremonies, and recorded in Sanskrit scrip-tural texts around 1,400 \nB.C. Cannabis was considered a\nholy herb and was characterized as the “soother of grief,”“the sky flyer,” and “the poor man’s heaven.” Centurieslater, around 700 \nB.C., the Assyrian people used the herb\nthey called Qunnabu, for incense. The ancient Greeks\nused cannabis as a remedy to treat inflammation, ear-ache, and edema (swelling of a body part due to collec-tion of fluids). Shortly after 500 \nB.C. the historian and\ngeographer Herodotus recorded that the peoples knownas Scythians used cannabis to produce fine linens. Theycalled the herb kannabis and inhaled the “intoxicating\nvapor” that resulted when it was burned. By the year 100\nB.C. the Chinese were using cannabis to make paper.\nCannabis use and cultivation migrated with the\nmovement of various traders and travelers, and knowl-edge of the herb’s value spread throughout the MiddleEast, Eastern Europe, and Africa. Around 100,Dioscorides, a surgeon in the Roman Legions under theEmperor Nero, named the herb Cannabis sativa and\nrecorded numerous medicinal uses. In the second centu-ry, the Chinese physician Hoa-Tho used cannabis in sur-gical procedures, relying on its analgesic properties. Inancient India, around 600, Sanskrit writers recorded arecipe for “pills of gaiety,” a combination of hemp andsugar. By 1150, Moslems were using cannabis fiber inEurope’s first paper production. This use of cannabis as adurable and renewable source of paper fiber continuedfor the next 750 years.\nBy the 1300s, government and religious authorities,\nconcerned about the psychoactive effects on citizens con-suming the herb, were placing harsh restrictions on itsuse. The Emir Soudon Sheikhouni of Joneima outlawedcannabis use among the poor. He destroyed the crops andordered that offenders’ teeth be pulled out. In 1484, PopeInnocent VIII outlawed the use of hashish, a concentrat-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2119Marijuanaed form of cannabis. Cannabis cultivation continued,\nhowever, because of its economic value. A little morethan a century later, the English Queen Elizabeth I issueda decree commanding that landowners holding 60 acresor more must grow hemp or pay a fine. Commerce inhemp, which was primarily valued for the strength andversatility of its fibers, was profitable and thriving. Hempropes and sails were crossing the sea to North Americawith the explorers. By 1621, the British were growingcannabis in Virginia where cultivation of hemp wasmandatory. In 1776, the Declaration of Independencewas drafted on hemp paper. Both President GeorgeWashington and President Thomas Jefferson were advo-cates of hemp as a valuable cash crop. Jefferson urgedfarmers to grow the crop in lieu of tobacco. By the1850s, hemp had become the third largest agriculturalcrop grown in North America. The U. S. Census of thatyear recorded 8,327 hemp plantations, each with 2,000or more acres in cultivation. But the invention of the cot-ton gin was already bringing many changes, and cottonwas becoming a prime and profitable textile fiber. Morechange came with the introduction of the sulfite andchlorine processes used to turn trees into paper. Restric-tions on the personal use of cannabis as a mood-altering,psychoactive herb, were soon to come.\nControversy\nThe 1856 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica ,i n\nits lengthy entry on hemp, noted that the herb “producesinebriation and delirium of decidedly hilarious character,inducing violent laughter, jumping and dancing.” This ine-briating effect of marijuana use has fueled the controversyand led to restrictions that have surrounded marijuana usethroughout history in many cultures and regions of theworld. Cannabis use has been criminalized in some partsof the United States since 1915. Utah was the first state tocriminalize it, then California and Texas. By 1923,Louisiana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington had legalrestrictions on the herb. New York prohibited cannabis usein 1927. Despite the restrictions, cannabis use was woveninto the cultural and social fabric in some communities,and widespread use persisted, particularly among theMexican, Asian, and African American populations.\nIn 1937, the federal government passed the Mari-\nhuana Tax Act, prohibiting the cultivation and farming ofmarijuana. This bill was introduced to Congress by thenSecretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, who was alsoa banker for the DuPont Corporation. That same year, theDuPont Chemical Company filed a patent for nylon,plastics, and a new bleaching process for paper. The1937 Marijuana Transfer Tax Bill prohibited industrialand medical use of marijuana and classified the flower-ing tops as narcotic, and restrictions on the cultivationand use of cannabis continued. Marijuana was catego-\nrized as an illegal narcotic, in the company of LSD andheroin, cocaine, and morphine. Illegal use continued.The FBI publication, Uniform Crime Reports for The\nUnited States, 1966 reported that 641,642 Americans\nwere arrested for marijuana offenses that year, with asmany as 85% of these arrests for simple possession,rather than cultivation or commerce.\nIn a reversal of the state-by-state progression of crimi-\nnalizing marijuana that led to the 1937 Marijuana TransferTax Bill, there is a movement underway, state by state, toendorse the legalized use of medical marijuana. By 1992,35 states in the United States had endorsed referenda formedical marijuana. A growing body of scientific researchand many thousands of years of folk use support theimportance of medical marijuana in treatment of a varietyof illnesses, and the economic value of hemp in the textile,paper, and cordage industries has a long history.\nThe controversy and misinformation persists around\nthis relatively safe and non-toxic herb. The World HealthOrganization, in a 1998 study, stated that the risks fromcannabis use were unlikely to seriously compare to thepublic health risks of the legal drugs, alcohol and tobac-co. And despite thousands of years of human consump-tion, not one death has been directly attributed tocannabis use. According to Lester Grinspoon, MD, andJames B. Bakalar, JD, in a 1995 Journal of the American\nMedical Association article, “Marihuana is also far less\naddictive and far less subject to abuse than many drugsnow used as muscle relaxants, hypnotics, and analgesics.The chief legitimate concern is the effect of smoking onthe lungs. Cannabis smoke carries even more tars andother particulate matter than tobacco smoke. But theamount smoked is much less, especially in medical use,and once marihuana is an openly recognized medicine,solutions may be found.”\nPurpose\nThe whole cannabis plant, including buds, leaves,\nseeds, and root, have all been utilized throughout thelong history of this controversial herb. Despite persistentlegal restrictions and severe criminal penalties for illicituse, marijuana continues to be widely used in the UnitedStates, and throughout the world, both for its mood-alter-ing properties and its proven medicinal applications. Theconflicting opinions on the safety and effectiveness ofcannabis in a climate of prohibition make any discussionof its beneficial uses politically charged. Marijuana hasanalgesic, anti-emetic, anti-inflammatory, sedative, anti-convulsive, and laxative actions. Clinical studies havedemonstrated its effectiveness in relieving nausea and\nvomiting following chemotherapy treatments for cancer.\nThe herb has also been shown to reduce intra-ocular\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2120Marijuanapressure in the eye by as much as 45%, a beneficial\naction in the treatment for glaucoma. Cannabis hasproven anticonvulsive action, and may be helpful intreating epilepsy. Other research has documented an in-vitro tumor inhibiting effect of THC. Marijuana alsoincreases appetite and reduces nausea and has been usedwith AIDS patients to counter weight loss and “wasting”\nthat may result from the disease. Several chemical con-stituents of cannabis displayed antimicrobial action andantibacterial effects in research studies. The componentsCBC and d-9-tetrahydrocannabinol have been shown todestroy and inhibit the growth of streptococci andstaphylococci bacteria.\nCannabis contains chemical compounds known as\ncannabinoids. Different cannabinoids seem to exert dif-ferent effects on the body after ingestion. Scientificresearch indicates that these substances have potentialtherapeutic value for pain relief, control of nausea and\nvomiting, and appetite stimulation. The primary activeagent identified to date is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, knownas THC. This chemical may constitute as much as 12%of the active chemicals in the herb, and is said to beresponsible for as much as 70–100% of the euphoricaction, or “high,” experienced when ingesting the herb.The predominance of this mental lightness or “euphoria”depends on the balance of other active ingredients andthe freshness of the herb. THC degrades into a compo-nent known as cannabinol, or CBN. This relatively inac-tive chemical predominates in marijuana that has beenstored too long prior to use. Another chemical compo-nent, cannabidiol, known as CBD, has a sedative andmildly analgesic effect, and contributes to a somaticheaviness sometimes experienced by marijuana users.\nBefore prohibition, cannabis was recommended for\ntreatment of gonorrhea, angina pectoris (constrictingpain in the chest due to insufficient blood to the heart),and choking fits. It was also used for insomnia ,neural-\ngia, rheumatism, gastrointestinal disorders, cholera,\ntetanus ,epilepsy , strychnine poisoning ,bronchitis ,\nwhooping cough , and asthma . Other phytotherapeutic\n(plant-based therapeutic) uses include treatment ofulcers, cancer ,emphysema ,migraine , and anxiety .\nThe United States federal government policy pro-\nhibits physicians from prescribing marijuana, even forseriously ill patients because of possible adverse effects,and the disputed belief that cannabis is dangerouslyaddictive. U. S. Attorney General Janet Reno warned thatphysicians in any state who prescribed marijuana couldlose the privilege of writing prescriptions, be excludedfrom Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and evenbe prosecuted for a federal crime, according to a 1997editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.Preparations\nCannabis extracts, prepared for medicinal application,\nare prohibited in the United States. Marijuana is ingestedby smoking , which quickly delivers the active ingredients\nto the blood system. The dried herb is also variously pre-pared for eating. The essential oil consists of betacaryophyllenes, humules, caryophyllene oxide, alpha-pinenes, beta-pinenes, limonene, myrcene, andbetaocimene. The oil expressed from the seeds is used formassage and in making salves used to relieve muscle strain.\nPrecautions\nMarijauna is considered a Class I narcotic and its\nuse has been restricted by federal law since 1937. Penal-ties include fines and imprisonment. The National Com-mission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse concluded in1972 that, “A careful search of the literature and testimo-ny of the nation’s health officials has not revealed a sin-gle human fatality in the United States proven to haveresulted solely from ingestion of marijuana.”\nResearch has shown that cannabis acts to increase\nheart frequency by as much as 40 beats per minute. Astudy reported by The American Heart Association inFebruary 2000, concluded that smoking marijuana canprecipitate a heart attack in persons with pre-existingheart conditions. One hour after smoking marijuana, thelikelihood of having a heart attack is four and one-half\ntimes greater than if the person had not smoked, accord-ing to the research.\nAn additional health concern is the effect that mari-\njuana smoking has on the lungs. Cannabis smoke carriesmore tars and other particulate matter than tobacco smoke.\nSide effects\nThe PDR For Herbal Medicine reports, “No health\nhazards or side effects are known in conjunction with theproper administration of designated therapeuticdosages.” Smoking the herb, however, “leads almost atonce to euphoric states (pronounced gaiety, laughingfits),” according to the PDR, and “long term usage leadsto a clear increase in tolerance for most of the pharmaco-logical effects.” The ability to safely operate automobilesand machinery can be impaired for up to eight hours afteringesting the herb. Chronic abuse results in “laryngitis,bronchitis, apathy, psychic decline, and disturbances ofgenital functions,” according to the PDR.\nSome people may be hypersensitive to marijuana.\nThey may experience paranoia or be allergic or sensitiveto the plant. Chronic sinus fungal infections have beenlinked to chronic marijuana smoking.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2121MarijuanaInteractions\nMarijauna use may mask the perceived effects of\nalcohol and cocaine when the drugs are consumed\ntogether. Marijuana is said to exert a synergistic effectwith other medicinal agents. When used with nitrousoxide it may enhance the effect.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFoster, Steven, and James A. Duke.

    "content": "Clare HanrahanMarriage counseling\nDefinition\nMarriage counseling is a type of psychotherapy for a\nmarried couple or established partners that tries toresolve problems in the relationship. Typically, two peo-ple attend counseling sessions together to discuss specif-ic issues.\nPurpose\nMarriage counseling is based on research that shows\nthat individuals and their problems are best handledwithin the context of their relationships. Marriage coun-selors are trained in psychotherapy and family systems,and focus on understanding their clients’ symptoms andthe way their interactions contribute to problems in therelationship.\nDescription\nMarriage counseling is usually a short-term therapy\nthat may take only a few sessions to work out problems inthe relationship. Typically, marriage counselors ask ques-tions about the couple’s roles, patterns, rules, goals, andbeliefs. Therapy often begins as the couple analyzes thegood and bad aspects of the relationship. The marriagecounselor then works with the couple to help them under-stand that, in most cases, both partners are contributing toproblems in the relationship. When this is understood, thetwo can then learn to change how they interact with eachother to solve problems. The partners may be encouragedto draw up a contract in which each partner describes thebehavior he or she will be trying to maintain.\nMarriage is not a requirement for two people to get\nhelp from a marriage counselor. Anyone person wishingto improve his or her relationships can get help withbehavioral problems, relationship issues, or with mentalor emotional disorders. Marriage counselors also offertreatment for couples before they get married to helpthem understand potential problem areas. A third type ofmarriage counseling involves postmarital therapy, inwhich divorcing couples who share children seek help inworking out their differences. Couples in the midst of adivorce find that marriage therapy during separation canhelp them find a common ground as they negotiate inter-personal issues and child custody.\nChoosing a therapist\nA marriage counselor is trained to use different types\nof therapy in work with individuals, couples, and groups.American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2122Marriage counseling(AAMFT) training includes supervision by experienced\ntherapists, a minimum of a master’s degree (includingspecific training in marriage and family therapy), and spe-cific graduate training in marriage and family therapy.\nWhen looking for a marriage counselor, a couple\nshould find out the counselor’s training and educationalbackground, professional associations, such as AAMFT,and state licensure, and whether the person has experi-ence in treating particular kinds of problem. Also, ques-tions should be asked concerning fees, insurance cover-age, the average length of therapy, and so on.\nNormal results\nMarriage counseling helps couples learn to deal\nmore effectively with problems, and can help preventsmall problems from becoming serious.

Inconti-\nnence also occurs when an individual involuntarily losesurine after pressure is placed on the abdomen (like dur-ing exercise , sexual activity, sneezing, coughing, laugh-\ning, or hugging).\nPrecautions\nIn some women, stress incontinence may be con-\ntrolled through nonsurgical means, such as:\n• kegel exercises (exercises that tighten pelvic muscles)\n• biofeedback (monitors temperature and muscle con-\ntractions in the vagina to help incontinent patients con-trol their pelvic muscles)\n•bladder training (behavioral modification program\nused to treat stress incontinence)\n• medication\n• inserted incontinence devices\nEach patient should undergo a full diagnostic\nworkup to determine the best course of treatment.\nDescription\nThe Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure, also\nknown as retropubic suspension or bladder neck suspen-sion surgery, is performed by a surgeon in a hospital set-ting. The patient is placed under general anesthesia, anda long, thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into thebladder through the narrow tube (urethra) that drains thebody’s urine. An incision is made across the abdomen,and the bladder is exposed. The bladder is separated fromsurrounding tissues. Stitches (sutures) are placed in thesetissues near the bladder neck and urethra. The urethra isthen lifted, and the sutures are attached to the pubic boneitself, or to tissue (fascia) behind the pubic bone. Thesutures support the bladder neck, helping the patient gaincontrol over urine flow.\nPreparation\nA complete evaluation to determine the cause of\nincontinence is critical to proper treatment. A thoroughmedical history and general physical examination\nshould be performed on candidates for the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure. Diagnostic testing mayinclude x rays, ultrasound, urine tests, and examinationof the pelvis. It may also include a series of urodynamictesting exams that measure bladder pressure and capaci-ty, and urinary flow.\nPatients undergoing a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz\nprocedure must not eat or drink for eight hours prior tothe surgery.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2123Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedureAftercare\nRecovery from a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure\nrequires two to six days of hospitalization. The catheter willbe removed from the patient’s bladder once normal bladderfunction resumes. Patients are advised to refrain from heavylifting for four to six weeks after the procedure.\nPatients should contact their physician immediately\nif they experience fever ,dizziness , or extreme nausea, or\nif their incision site becomes swollen, red, or hard.\nRisks\nThe Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure is an\ninvasive surgical procedure and, as such, it carries risksof infection, internal bleeding, and hemorrhage. There isalso a possibility of permanent damage to the bladder orurethra. The urethra may become scarred, causing a per-manent narrowing, or stricture.\nNormal results\nApproximately 85% of women who undergo the\nMarshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure are cured of theirstress incontinence.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBlaivas, Jerry.

For example, massage can reduce anxi-ety, improve pulmonary function in young asthma\npatients, reduce psycho-emotional distress in personssuffering from chronic inflammatory bowel disease,increase weight and improve motor development in pre-mature infants, and may enhance immune system func-tioning. Some medical conditions that massage therapycan help are: allergies , anxiety and stress, arthritis, asth-\nma and bronchitis ,carpal tunnel syndrome and other\nrepetitive motion injuries, chronic and temporary pain,circulatory problems, depression, digestive disorders,tension headache ,insomnia , myofascial pain, sports\ninjuries , and temporomandibular joint dysfunction.\nDescription\nOrigins\nMassage therapy is one of the oldest health care\npractices known to history. References to massage arefound in Chinese medical texts more than 4,000 yearsold. Massage has been advocated in Western health carepractices at least since the time of Hippocrates, the“Father of Medicine.” In the fourth century \nB.C. Hip-\npocrates wrote, “The physician must be acquainted withmany things and assuredly with rubbing” (the ancientGreek term for massage was rubbing).\nThe roots of modern, scientific massage therapy go\nback to Per Henrik Ling (1776–1839), a Swede, whodeveloped an integrated system consisting of massageand active and passive exercises. Ling established theRoyal Central Gymnastic Institute in Sweden in 1813 toteach his methods.\nModern, scientific massage therapy was introduced\nin the United States in the 1850s by two New York physi-cians, brothers George and Charles Taylor, who had stud-ied in Sweden. The first clinics for massage therapy inthe United States were opened by two Swedish physi-cians after the Civil War period. Doctor Baron Nils Posseoperated the Posse Institute in Boston and DoctorHartwig Nissen opened the Swedish Health Institute nearthe Capitol in Washington, D.C.\nAlthough there were periods when massage fell out\nof favor, in the 1960s it made a comeback in a differentway as a tool for relaxation, communication, and alterna-tive healing. Today, massage is one of the most popular\nhealing modalities. It is used by conventional, as well asalternative, medical communities and is now covered bysome health insurance plans.\nMassage therapy is the scientific manipulation of the\nsoft tissues of the body for the purpose of normalizingthose tissues and consists of a group of manual tech-niques that include applying fixed or movable pressure,holding, and/or causing movement of or to the body.While massage therapy is applied primarily with thehands, sometimes the forearms or elbows are used. Thesetechniques affect the muscular, skeletal, circulatory, lym-phatic, nervous, and other systems of the body. The basicphilosophy of massage therapy embraces the concept ofvis Medicatrix naturae , which is aiding the ability of the\nbody to heal itself, and is aimed at achieving or increas-ing health and well-being.\nTouch is the fundamental medium of massage thera-\npy. While massage can be described in terms of the typeof techniques performed, touch is not used solely in amechanistic way in massage therapy. One could look at adiagram or photo of a massage technique that depictswhere to place one’s hands and what direction the strokeshould go, but this would not convey everything that isimportant for giving a good massage. Massage also hasan artistic component.\nBecause massage usually involves applying touch\nwith some degree of pressure and movement, the massagetherapist must use touch with sensitivity in order to deter-mine the optimal amount of pressure to use for each per-son. For example, using too much pressure may cause thebody to tense up, while using too little may not haveenough effect. Touch used with sensitivity also allows themassage therapist to receive useful information via his orher hands about the client’s body, such as locating areas ofmuscle tension and other soft tissue problems. Becausetouch is also a form of communication, sensitive touch canconvey a sense of caring—an essential element in the ther-apeutic relationship—to the person receiving massage.\nIn practice, many massage therapists use more than\none technique or method in their work and sometimescombine several. Effective massage therapists ascertaineach person’s needs and then use the techniques that willmeet those needs best.\nSwedish massage uses a system of long gliding\nstrokes, kneading, and friction techniques on the moresuperficial layers of muscles, generally in the direction ofblood flow toward the heart, and sometimes combinedwith active and passive movements of the joints. It is usedto promote general relaxation, improve circulation andrange of motion, and relieve muscle tension. Swedishmassage is the most commonly used form of massage.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2125Massage therapyDeep tissue massage is used to release chronic pat-\nterns of muscular tension using slow strokes, direct pres-sure, or friction directed across the grain of the muscles.It is applied with greater pressure and to deeper layers ofmuscle than Swedish, which is why it is called deep tis-sue and is effective for chronic muscular tension.\nSports massage uses techniques that are similar to\nSwedish and deep tissue, but are specially adapted todeal with the effects of athletic performance on the bodyand the needs of athletes regarding training, performing,and recovery from injury.\nNeuromuscular massage is a form of deep massage\nthat is applied to individual muscles. It is used primarilyto release trigger points (intense knots of muscle tensionthat refer pain to other parts of the body), and also toincrease blood flow. It is often used to reduce pain. Trig-ger point massage and myotherapy are similar forms.\nAcupressure applies finger or thumb pressure to spe-\ncific points located on the acupuncture meridians (chan-\nnels of energy flow identified in Asian concepts of anato-my) in order to release blocked energy along these meridi-ans that causes physical discomforts, and re-balance theenergy flow. Shiatsu is a Japanese form of acupressure.\nThe cost of massage therapy varies according to geo-\ngraphic location, experience of the massage therapist, andlength of the massage. In the United States, the averagerange is from $35-60 for a one-hour session. Massagetherapy sessions at a client’s home or office may costmore due to travel time for the massage therapist. Mostsessions are one hour. Frequency of massage sessions canvary widely. If a person is receiving massage for a specif-ic problem, frequency can vary widely based on the con-dition, though it usually will be once a week. Some peo-ple incorporate massage into their regular personal healthand fitness program. They will go for massage on a regu-lar basis, varying from once a week to once a month.\nThe first appointment generally begins with infor-\nmation gathering, such as the reason for getting massagetherapy, physical condition and medical history, andother areas. The client is asked to remove clothing toone’s level of comfort. Undressing takes place in private,and a sheet or towel is provided for draping. The mas-sage therapist will undrape only the part of the bodybeing massaged. The client’s modesty is respected at alltimes. The massage therapist may use an oil or cream,which will be absorbed into the skin in a short time.\nTo receive the most benefit from a massage, general-\nly the person being massaged should give the therapistaccurate health information, report discomfort of anykind (whether it’s from the massage itself or due to theroom temperature or any other distractions), and be asreceptive and open to the process as possible.Insurance coverage for massage therapy varies wide-\nly. There tends to be greater coverage in states thatlicense massage therapy. In most cases, a physician’sprescription for massage therapy is needed. Once mas-sage therapy is prescribed, authorization from the insurermay be needed if coverage is not clearly spelled out inone’s policy or plan.\nPreparations\nGoing for a massage requires little in the way of\npreparation. Generally, one should be clean and shouldnot eat just before a massage. One should not be underthe influence of alcohol or non-medicinal drugs. Mas-sage therapists generally work by appointment and usu-ally will provide information about how to prepare for anappointment at the time of making the appointment.\nPrecautions\nMassage is comparatively safe; however it is gener-\nally contraindicated, i.e., it should not be used, if a per-son has one of the following conditions: advanced heartdiseases, hypertension (high blood pressure), phlebitis,\nthrombosis, embolism , kidney failure, cancer if mas-\nsage would accelerate metastasis (i.e., spread a tumor)or damage tissue that is fragile due to chemotherapy or\nother treatment, infectious diseases, contagious skinconditions, acute inflammation, infected injuries,unhealed fractures , dislocations, frostbite, large her-\nnias, torn ligaments, conditions prone to hemorrhage,and psychosis .\nMassage should not be used locally on affected\nareas (i.e., avoid using massage on the specific areas ofthe body that are affected by the condition) for the fol-lowing conditions: rheumatoid arthritis flare up,\neczema, goiter , and open skin lesions . Massage may be\nused on the areas of the body that are not affected bythese conditions.\nIn some cases, precautions should be taken before\nusing massage for the following conditions:pregnancy , high fevers, osteoporosis , diabetes, recent\npostoperative cases in which pain and muscular splint-ing (i.e., tightening as a protective reaction) would beincreased, apprehension, and mental conditions thatmay impair communication or perception. In suchcases, massage may or may not be appropriate. Thedecision on whether to use massage must be based onwhether it may cause harm. For example, if someonehas osteoporosis, the concern is whether bones arestrong enough to withstand the pressure applied. If onehas a health condition and has any hesitation aboutwhether massage therapy would be appropriate, aphysician should be consulted.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2126Massage therapySide effects\nMassage therapy does not have side effects. Some-\ntimes people are concerned that massage may leavethem too relaxed or too mentally unfocused. To the con-trary, massage tends to leave people feeling morerelaxed and alert.\nResearch and general acceptance\nBefore 1939, more than 600 research studies on\nmassage appeared in the main journals of medicine inEnglish. However, the pace of research was slowed bymedicine’s disinterest in massage therapy.\nMassage therapy research picked up again in the\n1980s, as the growing popularity of massage paralleledthe growing interest in complementary and alternativemedicine. Well designed studies have documented thebenefits of massage therapy for the treatment of acute andchronic pain, acute and chronic inflammation, chroniclymphedema , nausea, muscle spasm, various soft tissue\ndysfunctions, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and psycho-emotional stress, which may aggravate mental illness.\nPremature infants treated with daily massage thera-\npy gain more weight and have shorter hospital stays thaninfants who are not massaged. A study of 40 low-birth-weight babies found that the 20 massaged babies had a47% greater weight gain per day and stayed in the hospi-tal an average of six days less than 20 infants who did notreceive massage, resulting in a cost savings of approxi-mately $3,000 per infant. Cocaine-exposed, preterminfants given massage three times daily for a 10-day peri-od showed significant improvement. Results indicatedthat massaged infants had fewer postnatal complicationsand exhibited fewer stress behaviors during the 10-dayperiod, had a 28% greater daily weight gain, and demon-strated more mature motor behaviors.\nA study comparing 52 hospitalized depressed and\nadjustment disorder children and adolescents with a con-trol group that viewed relaxation videotapes, found mas-sage therapy subjects were less depressed and anxious,and had lower saliva cortisol levels (an indicator of lessdepression).\nAnother study showed massage therapy produced\nrelaxation in 18 elderly subjects, demonstrated in mea-sures such as decreased blood pressure and heart rate andincreased skin temperature.\nA combination of massage techniques for 52 sub-\njects with traumatically induced spinal pain led to signif-icant improvements in acute and chronic pain andincreased muscle flexibility and tone. This study alsofound massage therapy to be extremely cost effective,with cost savings ranging from 15-50%. Massage hasalso been shown to stimulate the body’s ability to natu-\nrally control pain by stimulating the brain to produceendorphins. Fibromyalgia is an example of a condition\nthat may be favorably affected by this effect.\nA pilot study of five subjects with symptoms of ten-\nsion and anxiety found a significant response to massagetherapy in one or more psycho-physiological parametersof heart rate, frontalis and forearm extensor electromyo-grams (EMGs) and skin resistance, which demonstraterelaxation of muscle tension and reduced anxiety.\nLymph drainage massage has been shown to be\nmore effective than mechanized methods or diureticdrugs to control lymphedema secondary to radical mas-\ntectomy , consequently using massage to control lym-\nphedema would significantly lower treatment costs. Astudy found that massage therapy can have a powerfuleffect upon psycho-emotional distress in persons suffer-ing from chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Massagetherapy was effective in reducing the frequency ofepisodes of pain and disability in these patients.\nMassage may enhance the immune system. A study\nsuggests an increase in cytotoxic capacity associatedwith massage. A study of chronic fatigue syndrome\nsubjects found that a group receiving massage therapyhad lower depression, emotional distress, and somaticsymptom scores, more hours of sleep, and lower epi-nephrine and cortisol levels than a control group.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBeck, Mark F.

    "title": "Mastectomy",
    "content": "Mastectomy\nDefinition\nMastectomy is the surgical removal of the breast for\nthe treatment or prevention of breast cancer .\nPurpose\nMastectomy is performed as a surgical treatment for\nbreast cancer . The severity of a breast cancer is evaluated\naccording to a complex system called staging. This takesinto account the size of the tumor and whether it hasspread to the lymph nodes, adjacent tissues, and/or distantparts of the body. A mastectomy is usually the recom-mended surgery for more advanced breast cancers.Women with earlier stage breast cancers, who might alsohave breast-conserving surgery ( lumpectomy ), may\nchoose to have a mastectomy. In the United States,approximately 50,000 women a year undergo mastectomy.\nThe size, location, and type of tumor are important\nconsiderations when choosing the best surgery to treatbreast cancer. The size of the breast is also an importantfactor. A woman’s psychological concerns and lifestylechoices should also be considered when making a decision.\nThere are many factors that make a mastectomy the\ntreatment of choice for a patient. Large tumors are diffi-cult to remove with good cosmetic results. This is espe-cially true if the woman has small breasts. Sometimesmultiple areas of cancer are found in one breast, makingremoval of the whole breast necessary. The surgeon issometimes unable to remove the tumor with a sufficientamount, or margin, of normal tissue surrounding it. Inthis situation, the entire breast needs to be removed.Recurrence of breast cancer after a lumpectomy is anoth-er indication for mastectomy.\nRadiation therapy is almost always recommended\nfollowing a lumpectomy. If a woman is unable to haveradiation, a mastectomy is the treatment of choice. Preg-nant women cannot have radiation therapy for fear ofharming the fetus. A woman with certain collagen vascu-lar diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or\nscleroderma , would experience unacceptable scarring\nand damage to her connective tissue from radiation expo-sure. Any woman who has had therapeutic radiation tothe chest area for other reasons cannot tolerate additionalexposure for breast cancer therapy.\nThe need for radiation therapy after breast conserv-\ning surgery may make mastectomy more appealing fornonmedical reasons. Some women fear radiation andchoose the more extensive surgery so radiation treatmentwill not be required. The commitment of time, usuallyfive days a week for six weeks, may not be acceptable forother women. This may be due to financial, personal, orjob-related factors. In geographically isolated areas, acourse of radiation therapy may require lengthy traveland perhaps unacceptable amounts of time away fromfamily or other responsibilities.\nSome women choose mastectomy because they\nstrongly fear recurrence of the breast cancer, and lumpec-tomy seems too risky. Keeping a breast that has containedcancer may feel uncomfortable for some patients. Theyprefer mastectomy, so the entire breast will be removed.\nThe issue of prophylactic mastectomy, or removal of\nthe breast to prevent future breast cancer, is controversial.Women with a strong family history of breast cancerand/or who test positive for a known cancer-causing genemay choose to have both breasts removed. Patients whohave had certain types of breast cancers that are more like-ly to recur may elect to have the unaffected breastremoved. Although there is some evidence that this proce-dure can decrease the chances of developing breast cancer,it is not a guarantee. It is not possible to be certain that allbreast tissue has been removed. There have been caseswhere breast cancers have occurred after both breasts havebeen removed. However, a 1999 survey of over 500women found that 70% of women who chose prophylacticmastectomy were satisfied with the procedure.\nPrecautions\nThe decision to have mastectomy or lumpectomy\nshould be carefully considered. It is important that thewoman be fully informed of all the potential risks and ben-efits of each surgical treatment before making a choice.\nDescription\nThere are several types of mastectomies. The radical\nmastectomy, also called the Halsted mastectomy, is veryrarely performed today. It was developed in the late\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2128Mastectomy1800s, when it was thought that more extensive surgery\nwas most likely to cure cancer. A radical mastectomyinvolves removal of the breast, all surrounding lymphnodes up to the collarbone, and the underlying chestmuscle. Women were often left disfigured and disabled,with a large defect in the chest wall requiring skin graft-\ning, and significantly decreased arm sensation and\nmotion. Unfortunately, and inaccurately, it is still theoperation many women picture when the word mastecto-my is mentioned.\nSurgery that removes breast tissue, nipple, an ellipse\nof skin, and some axillary or underarm lymph nodes, butleaves the chest muscle intact, is usually called a modi-fied radical mastectomy. This is the most common typeof mastectomy performed today. The surgery leaves awoman with a more normal chest shape than the olderradical mastectomy procedure, and a scar that is not visi-ble in most clothing. It also allows for immediate ordelayed breast reconstruction .\nIn a simple mastectomy, only the breast tissue, nip-\nple, and a small piece of overlying skin is removed. If afew of the axillary lymph nodes closest to the breast arealso taken out, the surgery may be called an extendedsimple mastectomy.\nThere are other variations on the term mastectomy. A\nskin-sparing mastectomy uses special techniques that pre-serve the patient’s breast skin for use in reconstruction,although the nipple is still removed. Total mastectomy is aconfusing expression, as it may be used to refer to a mod-ified radical mastectomy or a simple mastectomy.Many women choose to have breast reconstruction\nperformed in conjunction with the mastectomy. Thereconstruction can be done using a woman’s own abdom-inal tissue, or using saline-filled artificial expanders,which leave the breast relatively flat but partially recon-structed. Additionally, there are psychological benefits tocoming out of the surgery with the first step to a recon-structed breast. Immediate reconstruction will add timeand cost to the mastectomy procedure, but the patient canavoid the physical impact of a later surgery.\nA mastectomy is typically performed in a hospital\nsetting, but specialized outpatient facilities are some-times used. The surgery is done under general anesthesia.The type and location of the incision may vary accordingto plans for reconstruction or other factors, such as oldscars. As much breast tissue as possible is removed.Approximately 10 to 20 axillary lymph nodes are usuallyremoved. All tissue is sent to the pathology laboratory foranalysis. If no immediate reconstruction is planned, sur-gical drains are left in place to prevent fluid accumula-tion. The skin is sutured and bandages are applied.\nThe surgery may take from two to five hours.\nPatients usually stay at least one night in the hospital,although outpatient mastectomy is increasingly per-formed for about 10% of all patients. Insurance usuallycovers the cost of mastectomy. If immediate reconstruc-tion is performed, the length of stay, recovery period,insurance reimbursement, and fees will vary from mas-tectomy alone. In 1998, the Women’s Health and Can-cer Rights Act required insurance plans to cover the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2129Mastectomy\nPartial \nmastectomy\n(quadrantectomy)Simple \nmastectomyModified radical \nmastectomy with\nlymph nodes removedRadical mastectomy\nwith chest \nmuscle removed\nThere are four types of mastectomies: partial mastectomy, or lumpectomy, in which the tumor and surrounding tissue is\nremoved; simple mastectomy, where the entire breast and some axillary lymph nodes are removed; modified radical mastec-tomy, in which the entire breast and all axillary lymph nodes are removed; and the radical mastectomy, where the entirebreast, axillary lymph nodes, and chest muscles are removed. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)cost of breast reconstruction in conjunction with a mas-\ntectomy procedure.\nPreparation\nRoutine preoperative preparations, such as not eating\nor drinking the night before surgery, are typically orderedfor a mastectomy. On rare occasions, the patient may alsobe asked to donate blood in case a blood transfusion is\nrequired during surgery. The patient should advise thesurgeon of any medications she is taking. Informationregarding expected outcomes and potential complicationsshould also be a part of preparation for a mastectomy, asfor any surgical procedure. It is especially important thatwomen know about sensations they might experienceafter surgery, so they are not misinterpreted as a sign ofpoor wound healing or recurrent cancer.\nAftercare\nIn the past, women often stayed in the hospital at\nleast several days. Now many patients go home the sameday or within a day or two after their mastectomies. Vis-its from home care nurses can sometimes be arranged,but patients need to learn how to care for themselvesbefore discharge from the hospital. Patients may need tolearn to change bandages and/or care for the incision.The surgical drains must be attended to properly; thisincludes emptying the drain, measuring fluid output,moving clots through the drain, and identifying problemsthat need attention from the doctor or nurse. If the drainbecomes blocked, fluid or blood may collect at the surgi-cal site. Left untreated, this accumulation may causeinfection and/or delayed wound healing.\nAfter a mastectomy, activities such as driving may\nbe restricted according to individual needs. Pain is usual-\nly well controlled with prescribed medication. Severepain may be a sign of complications, and should bereported to the physician. A return visit to the surgeon isusually scheduled 7 to 10 days after the procedure.\nExercises to maintain shoulder and arm mobility\nmay be prescribed as early as 24 hours after surgery.These are very important in restoring strength and pro-moting good circulation. However, intense exercise\nshould be avoided for a time after surgery in order to pre-vent injury. The specific exercises suggested by thephysician will change as healing progresses. Physicaltherapy is an integral part of care after a mastectomy, aid-ing in the overall recovery process.\nEmotional care is another important aspect of recov-\nery from a mastectomy. A mastectomy patient may feel arange of emotions including depression, negative self-image, grief, fear and anxiety about possible recurrence\nof the cancer, anger, or guilt. Patients are advised to seekcounseling and/or support groups and to express their\nemotions to others, whether family, friends, or therapists.Assistance in dealing with the psychological effects ofthe breast cancer diagnosis, as well as the surgery, can beinvaluable for women.\nMeasures to prevent injury or infection to the affect-\ned arm should be taken, especially if axillary lymphnodes were removed. There are a number of specificinstructions, all directed toward avoiding pressure orconstriction of the arm. Extra care must be exercised toavoid injury, to treat it properly if it occurs, and to seekmedical attention promptly when appropriate.\nAdditional treatment for breast cancer may be nec-\nessary after a mastectomy. Depending on the type oftumor, lymph node status, and other factors, chemother-\napy, radiation therapy, and/or hormone therapy may be\nprescribed.\nRisks\nRisks that are common to any surgical procedure\ninclude bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction, or unex-pected scarring. After mastectomy and axillary lymphnode dissection, a number of complications are possible.A woman may experience decreased feeling in the backof her armpit or other sensations including numbness,tingling, or increased skin sensitivity. Some womenreport phantom breast symptoms, experiencing itching ,\naching, or other sensations in the breast that has beenremoved. There may be scarring around where the lymphnodes were removed, resulting in decreased arm mobilityand requiring more intense physical therapy.\nApproximately 10% to 20% of patients develop lym-\nphedema after axillary lymph node removal. This\nswelling of the arm, caused by faulty lymph drainage, canrange from mild to very severe. It can be treated with ele-vation, elastic bandages, and specialized physical therapy.Lymphedema is a chronic condition that requires continu-ing treatment. This complication can arise at any time,even years after surgery. A new technique called sentinellymph node mapping and biopsy, which may eliminatethe need for removing many lymph nodes, is being tested.\nNormal results\nA mastectomy is performed as the definitive surgical\ntreatment for breast cancer. The goal of the procedure isthat the breast cancer is completely removed and doesnot recur.\nAbnormal results\nAn abnormal result of a mastectomy is the incom-\nplete removal of the breast cancer or a recurrence of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2130Mastectomycancer. Other abnormal results include long-lasting\n(chronic) pain or impairment that does not improve afterseveral months of physical therapy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBerger, Karen J., and John Bostwick III.

    "title": "Mastitis",
    "content": "Mastitis\nDefinition\nMastitis is an infection of the breast. It usually only\noccurs in women who are breastfeeding their babies.\nDescription\nBreastfeeding is the act of allowing a baby to suckle\nat the breast, in order to drink the mother’s milk. In theprocess, unaccustomed to the vigorous pull and tug ofthe infant’s suck, the nipples may become sore, cracked,or slightly abraded. This creates a tiny opening in thebreast, through which bacteria can enter. The presence ofmilk, with high sugar content, gives the bacteria anexcellent source of nutrition . Under these conditions,\nthe bacteria are able to multiply, until they are plentifulenough to cause an infection within the breast.\nMastitis usually begins more than two to four weeks\nafter delivery of the baby. It is a relatively uncommoncomplication of breastfeeding mothers, occurring in onlyapproximately 2% of women.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common bacteria causing mastitis is called\nStaphylococcus aureus . In 25-30% of people, this bacte-\nria is present on the skin lining normal, uninfected nos-trils. It is probably this bacteria, clinging to the baby’snostrils, that is available to create infection when anopportunity (crack in the nipple) presents itself.\nUsually, only one breast is involved. An area of the\naffected breast becomes swollen, red, hard, and painful.Other symptoms of mastitis include fever , chills, and\nincreased heart rate.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis involves obtaining a sample of breast milk\nfrom the infected breast. The milk is cultured, allowingcolonies of bacteria to grow. The causative bacteria canthen be specially prepared for identification under amicroscope. At the same time, tests can be performed todetermine what type of antibiotic would be most effec-tive against that particular bacteria.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2131MastitisTreatment\nThe antibiotics dicloxacillin and erythromycin are\nboth used to treat mastitis. Breastfeeding should be con-tinued, because the rate of abscess formation (an abscess\nis a persistent pocket of pus) in the infected breast goesup steeply among women who stop breastfeeding duringa bout with mastitis. Most practitioners allow women totake acetaminophen while nursing, to relieve both fever\nand pain . As always, breastfeeding women need to make\nsure that any medication they take is also safe for thebaby, since almost all drugs they take appear in thebreastmilk. Warm compresses applied to the affectedbreast can be soothing.\nPrognosis\nPrognosis for uncomplicated mastitis is excellent.\nAbout 10% of women with mastitis will end up with anabscess within the affected breast. An abscess is a collec-tion of pus within the breast. This complication willrequire a surgical procedure to drain the pus.\nPrevention\nThe most important aspect of prevention involves\ngood handwashing to try to prevent the infant from acquir-ing the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in the first place.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCurrent Obstetric & Gynecologic Diagnosis & Treatment.

    "title": "Mastocytosis",
    "content": "Mastocytosis\nDefinition\nMastocytosis is a disease characterized by the pres-\nence of too many mast cells in various organs and tissues.\nDescription\nThe body has a variety of free-roaming cell popula-\ntions that function as immunogenic agents. Mostimmunogenic cells fall into the category of white bloodcells, but some remain in tissues and are not found in theblood. Mast cells are such a group.\nMast cells are found primarily in the skin and diges-\ntive system, including the liver and spleen, and producehistamine, a chemical most famous for its ability to causeitching . Histamine also causes acid indigestion ,diar-\nrhea , flushing, heart pounding, headaches, and can even\ncause the blood pressure to drop suddenly.\nMastocytosis comes in three forms. Most cases pro-\nduce symptoms but do not shorten life expectancy. Thethree forms are:\n• mastocytoma, a benign skin tumor\n• urticaria pigmentosa, small collections of mast cells in the\nskin that manifest as salmon or brown-colored patches\n• systemic mastocytosis, the collection of mast cells in\nthe skin, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, gastrointestinaltract, and bones\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of mastocytosis is unknown. People with\nsystemic mastocytosis have bone and joint pain . Peptic\nulcers are frequent because of the increased stomach acidstimulated by histamine. Many patients with systemic mas-tocytosis also develop urticaria pigmentosa. These skin\nlesions itch when stroked and may become fluid-filled.\nDiagnosis\nA biopsy of the skin patches aids diagnosis. An ele-\nvated level of histamine in the urine or blood is alsoindicative of mastocytosis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2132Mastocytosis\nMastitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection through a\nnipple damaged during breastfeeding. (Photograph by Dr. P .\nMarazzi, Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)Treatment\nMastocytoma usually occurs in childhood and clears\nup on its own. Urticaria pigmentosa (present alone with-out systemic disease) also dramatically clears orimproves as adolescence approaches.\nSeveral medications are helpful in relieving symptoms\nof systemic mastocytosis. Antihistamines and drugs that\nreduce stomach acid are frequently needed. Headachesrespond to migraine treatment. A medicine called cro-molyn helps with the bowel symptoms. Several other stan-dard and experimental medications have been used.\nPrognosis\nMastocytoma and urticaria pigmentosa rarely if ever,\ndevelop into systemic mastocytosis, and both sponta-neously improve over time. Systemic mastocytosis is onlysymptomatically treated. There is no known treatmentthat decreases the number of mast cells within tissue.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAusten, K.

This surgery is rarely needed\ntoday because of the widespread use of antibiotics .\nPurpose\nMastoidectomy is performed to remove infected air\ncells within the mastoid bone caused by mastoiditis , ear\ninfection, or an inflammatory disease of the middle ear(cholesteatoma). The cells are open spaces containing airthat are located throughout the mastoid bone. They areconnected to a cavity in the upper part of the bone, whichis in turn connected to the middle ear. As a result, infec-tions in the middle ear can sometimes spread through themastoid bone. When antibiotics can’t clear this infection,it may be necessary to remove the infected air cells bysurgery. Mastoidectomies are also performed sometimesto repair paralyzed facial nerves.\nDescription\nMastoidectomy is performed less often today\nbecause of the widespread use of antibiotics to treat earinfections.\nThere are several different types of mastoidectomy:\n• Simple (or closed). The operation is performed through\nthe ear or through a cut (incision) behind the ear. Thesurgeon opens the mastoid bone and removes the infect-ed air cells. The eardrum is cut (incised) to drain themiddle ear. Topical antibiotics are then placed in the ear.\n• Radical mastoidectomy. The eardrum and most middle\near structures are removed, but the innermost smallbone (the stapes) is left behind so that a hearing aid canbe used later to offset the hearing loss .\n• Modified radical mastoidectomy. The eardrum and the\nmiddle ear structures are saved, which allows for betterhearing than is possible after a radical operation.\nThe wound is then stitched up around a drainage\ntube, which is removed a day or two later. The procedureusually takes between two and three hours.\nPreparation\nThe doctor will give the patient a thorough ear, nose,\nand throat examination as well as a detailed hearing testbefore surgery. Patients are given an injection beforesurgery to make them drowsy.\nAftercare\nPainkillers are usually needed for the first day or two\nafter the operation. The patient should drink fluids freely.After the stitches are removed, the bulky mastoid dressingcan be replaced with a smaller dressing if the ear is stilldraining. The patient is given antibiotics for several days.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2133MastoidectomyThe patient should tell the doctor if any of the fol-\nlowing symptoms occur:\n• bright red blood on the dressing\n• stiff neck or disorientation.

It is almost always associated with otitis\nmedia , an infection of the middle ear. In the most serious\ncases, the bone itself becomes infected.\nDescription\nThe mastoid is a part of the side (temporal bone) of\nthe skull. It can be felt as a bony bump just behind andslightly above the level of the earlobe. The mastoid hasbeen described as resembling a “honeycomb” of tiny par-titioned-off airspaces. The mastoid is connected with themiddle ear, so that when there is a collection of fluid inthe middle ear, there is usually also a slight collection offluid within the airspaces of the mastoid.\nMastoiditis can range from a simple case of some\nfluid escaping into the mastoid air cells during a middleear infection, to a more complex infection which pene-trates through to the lining of the mastoid bone, to a verysevere and destructive infection of the mastoid bone itself.\nCauses and symptoms\nMastoiditis is caused by the same types of bacteria\nwhich cause middle ear infections ( Streptococcus pneu-\nmoniae and Haemophilus influenzae ), as well as by a\nvariety of other bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus ,\nPseuodomonas aeruginosa ,Klebsiella ,Escherichia coli ,\nProteus ,Prevotella ,Fusobacterium ,Porphyromonas , and\nBacteroides ). Mastoiditis may occur due to the progres-\nsion of an untreated, or undertreated, middle ear infection.\nSymptoms of mastoiditis may at first be the same as\nsymptoms of an early middle ear infection. With progres-sion, however, the swollen mastoid may push the outerear slightly forward and away from the head. The areabehind the ear will appear red and swollen, and will bevery sore. There may be drainage of pus from the infectedear. In some cases, the skin over the mastoid may developan opening through which pus drains. Fever is common.\nDiagnosis\nMastoiditis is usually suspected when a severe mid-\ndle ear infection is accompanied by redness, swelling, andpain in the mastoid area. A computed tomography scan\n(CT scan) will show inflammation and fluid within theairspaces of the mastoid, as well as the erosion of the littlewalls of bone that should separate the air spaces. If thereis any fluid draining from the ear or mastoid, this can be\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2134Mastoiditiscollected and processed in a laboratory to allow identifi-\ncation of the causative organism. If there is no fluid avail-able, a tiny needle can be used to obtain a sample of thefluid which has accumulated behind the eardrum.\nTreatment\nIdentification of the causative organism guides the\npractitioner’s choice of antibiotic. Depending on theseverity of the infection, the antibiotic can be given ini-tially through a needle in the vein (intravenously or IV),and then (as the patient improves) by mouth.\nIn the case of a very severe infection of the mastoid\nbone itself, with a collection of pus ( abscess ), an opera-\ntion to remove the mastoid part of the temporal bone isoften necessary ( mastoidectomy ).\nPrognosis\nWith early identification of mastoiditis, the progno-\nsis is very good. When symptoms are not caught earlyenough, however, a number of complications can occur.These include an infection of the tissues covering thebrain and spinal cord ( meningitis ), a pocket of infection\nwithin the brain (abscess), or an abscess within the mus-cles of the neck. All of these complications have poten-tially more serious prognoses.\nPrevention\nPrevention of mastoiditis involves careful and com-\nplete treatment of any middle ear infections.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDuran, Marlene, et al. “Infections of the Upper Respiratory\nTract.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine ,e d .\nAnthony S.

    "title": "Maxillofacial trauma",
    "content": "Maxillofacial trauma\nDefinition\nMaxillofacial trauma refers to any injury to the face\nor jaw caused by physical force, foreign objects ,o r\nburns .\nDescription\nMaxillofacial trauma includes injuries to any of the\nbony or fleshy structures of the face.\nAny part of the face may be affected. Teeth may be\nknocked out or loosened. The eyes and their muscles,nerves, and blood vessels may be injured as well as theeye socket (orbit), which can be fractured by a forcefulblow. The lower jaw (mandible) may be dislocated byforce. Although anchored by strong muscles for chewing,the jaw is unstable in comparison with other bones and iseasily dislocated from the temporomandibular joints thatattach it to the skull. A fractured nose or jaw may affectthe ability to breathe or eat. Any maxillofacial traumamay also prevent the passage of air or be severe enoughto cause a concussion or more serious brain injury.\nAthletes are particularly at risk of maxillofacial\ninjuries. Boxers suffer repeated blows to the face andoccasional knockouts (traumatic brain injury). Football,basketball, hockey, and soccer players, and many otherathletes are at risk for milder forms of brain injury calledconcussions. There are an estimated 300,000 cases everyyear. Overall, there are one million new traumatic brain\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2135Maxillofacial traumainjuries every year, causing 50,000 deaths. Of the rest,\n7–9% are left with long-term disability.\nBurns to the face are also categorized as maxillofa-\ncial trauma.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are no reliable statistics on the incidence of\nmaxillofacial trauma because there are so many typesand many are not reported. Automobile accidents are amajor cause, as well as participation in sports, fights, andother violent acts, and being hit by an object accidentally,for instance being hit by a baseball while watching agame. People most at risk are athletes, anyone who dri-ves a vehicle or rides in one, and those who do dangerouswork or engage in aggressive types of behavior.\nOne study reported in August 2000 that 42% of all\nfacial fractures resulted from sports activity.\nThe major symptoms of most facial injuries are\npain , swelling, bleeding, and bruising, although a frac-\ntured jaw also prevents the person from working his jawproperly, and symptoms of a fractured nose also includeblack eyes and possible blockage of the airway due toswelling and bleeding.\nSymptoms of eye injury or orbital fracture can\ninclude blurred or double vision, decreased mobility of theeye, and numbness in the area of the eye. In severe injuriesthere can be temporary or permanent loss of vision.\nBurn symptoms are pain, redness, and possibly blis-\nters, fever , and headache . Extensive burns can cause the\nvictim to go into shock . In that situation, he will have\nlow blood pressure and a rapid pulse.\nSymptoms of traumatic brain injury include prob-\nlems with thinking, memory, and judgement as well asmood swings, and difficulty with coordination and bal-ance. These symptoms linger for weeks or months, and\nin severe cases can be permanent. Double vision formonths after the injury is not uncommon.\nDiagnosis\nTrauma is usually diagnosed in an emergency room or\nphysician’s office by physical examination and/or x ray.\nSome injuries require diagnosis by a specialist. A detailedreport of how the injury occurred is also taken. In somecases, diagnosis cannot be made until swelling subsides.\nTreatment\nTreatment varies, depending on the type and extent\nof the injury.\nDislocation of the jaw can be treated by a primary\ncare physician by exerting pressure in the proper manner.If muscle spasm prevents the jaw from moving back intoalignment, a sedative is administered intravenously (IV) torelax the muscles. Afterward, the patient must avoid open-ing the jaw wide as he will be prone to repeat dislocations.\nA jaw fracture may be minor enough to heal with\nsimple limitation of movement and time. More seriousfractures require complicated, multi-step treatment. Thejaw must be surgically immobilized by a qualified oral ormaxillofacial surgeon or an otolaryngologist. The jaw isproperly aligned and secured with metal pins and wires.Proper alignment is necessary to ensure that the bite iscorrect. If the bite is off, the patient may develop a painfuldisorder called temporomandibular joint syndrome.\nDuring the weeks of healing the patient is limited to\na liquid diet sipped through a straw and must be carefulnot to choke or vomit since he cannot open his mouth toexpel the vomitus. The surgeon will prescribe painrelievers and perhaps muscle relaxants . Healing time\nvaries according to the patient’s overall health, but willtake at least several weeks.\nAnother common maxillofacial fracture is a broken\nnose. The bones that form the bridge of the nose may befractured, but cartilage may also be damaged, particular-ly the nasal septum which divides the nose. If hit fromthe side, the bones and cartilage are displaced to the side,but if hit from the front, they are splayed out. Severeswelling can inhibit diagnosis and treatment. Mild trau-ma to the nose can sometimes heal without the personbeing aware of the fracture unless there is obvious defor-mity. The nose will be tender for at least three weeks.\nEither before the swelling begins or after it subsides,\nsome 10 days after the injury, the doctor can assess theextent of the damage. Physical examination of the insideusing a speculum and the outside, in addition to a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2136Maxillofacial trauma\nFace of an elderly woman suffering from maxillofacial trau-\nma.(Photo Researchers. Reproduced by permission.)detailed history of how the injury occurred will deter-\nmine appropriate treatment. The doctor should beinformed of any previous nasal fractures, nasal surgery,or chronic disease such as osteoporosis . Sometimes an x\nray is useful, but it is not always required.\nA primary care physician may treat a nasal fracture\nhimself, but if there is extensive damage or the air pas-sage is blocked, he will refer the patient to an otolaryn-gologist or a plastic surgeon for treatment. Initially thenose may be packed to control bleeding and hold theshape. It is reset under anesthesia. A protective shield orbandage may be placed over it while the fracture heals.\nIn the case of orbital fractures, there is great danger\nof permanent damage to vision. Double vision anddecreased mobility of the eye are common complications.Surgical reconstruction may be required if the fracturechanges the position of the eye or there is other facialdeformity. Treatment requires a maxillofacial surgeon.\nWhen the eyes have been exposed to chemicals, they\nmust be washed out for 15 minutes with clear water.Contact lenses may be removed only after rinsing theeyes. The eyes should then be kept covered until the per-son can be evaluated by a primary care physician or oph-thalmologist.\nWhen a foreign object is lodged in the eye, the per-\nson should not rub the eye or put pressure on it whichwould further injure the eyeball. The eye should be cov-ered to protect it until medical attention can be obtained.\nSeveral kinds of traumatic injuries can occur to the\nmouth. A person can suffer a laceration (cut) to the lips ortongue, or loosening of teeth, or have teeth knocked out.Such injuries often accompany a jaw fracture or otherfacial injury. Wounds to the soft tissues of the mouth\nbleed freely, but the plentiful blood supply that leads tothis heavy bleeding also helps healing. It is important toclean the wound thoroughly with salt water or hydrogenperoxide rinse to prevent infection. Large cuts mayrequire sutures, and should be done by a maxillofacialsurgeon for a good cosmetic result, particularly when thelaceration is on the edge of the lip line (vermilion). Thedoctor will prescribe an antibiotic because there is nor-mally a large amount of bacteria present in the mouth.\nAny injury to the teeth should be evaluated by a den-\ntist for treatment and prevention of infection. Implanta-tion of a tooth is sometimes possible if it has been han-dled carefully and protected. The tooth should be held bythe crown, not the root, and kept in milk, saline, or con-tact lens fluid. The patient’s dentist can refer him to aspecialist in this field.\nFor first degree burns, put a cold-water compress on\nthe area or run cold water on it. Put a clean bandage on itfor protection. Second and third degree burn victims\nmust be taken to the hospital for treatment.\nFluids are replaced there through an IV . This is vital\nsince a patient in shock will die unless those lost fluidsare replaced quickly. Antibiotics are given to combat\ninfection since the burns make the body vulnerable toinfection.\nTreatment for a head injury requires examination by\na primary care physician unless symptoms point to a moreserious injury. In that case, the victim must seek emer-gency care. A concussion is treated with rest and avoid-ance of contact sports. Very often athletes who have suf-fered a concussion are allowed to play again too soon, per-haps in the mistaken impression that the injury isn’t so badif the player didn’t lose consciousness. Anyone who hashad one concussion is at increased risk of another one.\nDanger signs that the injury is more serious include\nworsening headaches, vomiting, weakness, numbness,unsteadiness, change in the appearance of the eyes,seizures, slurred speech, confusion, agitation, or the vic-tim won’t wake up. These signs require immediate trans-port to the hospital. A neurologist will evaluate the situa-tion, usually with a CT scan. A stay in a rehabilitation\nfacility may become necessary.\nAlternative treatments\nFractures, burns, and deep lacerations require treat-\nment by a doctor but alternative treatments can help thebody withstand injury and assist the healing process. Cal-cium, minerals ,vitamins , all part of a balanced and\nnutrient-rich diet, as well as regular exercise , build strong\nbones that can withstand force well. After an injury, cran-\niosacral therapy may help healing and ease the\nheadaches that follow a concussion or other head trauma.A physical therapist can offer ultrasound that raises tem-perature to ease pain, or biofeedback in which the patient\nlearns how to tense and relax muscles to relieve pain.Hydrotherapy may ease the stress of recovering from\ntrauma. Chinese medicine seeks to reconnect the chialong the body’s meridians and thus aid healing. Homeo-pathic physicians may prescribe natural medicines suchas Arnica or Symphytum to enhance healing.\nPrognosis\nWhen appropriate treatment is obtained quickly\nafter an injury, the prognosis can be excellent. However,if the victim of trauma has osteoporosis or a debilitatingchronic disease, healing is more problematic. Healingalso depends upon the extent of the injury. An automo-bile accident or a gunshot wound, for example, can causesevere facial trauma that may require multiple surgical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2137Maxillofacial traumaprocedures and a considerable amount of time to heal.\nBurns and lacerations cause scarring that might beimproved by plastic surgery.\nPrevention\nSafety equipment is vital to preventing maxillofacial\ntrauma from automobile accidents and sports.

    "title": "Measles",
    "content": "Measles\nDefinition\nMeasles is an infection, caused by a virus, which\ncauses an illness displaying a characteristic skin rash.Measles is also sometimes called rubeola, 5-day measles,or hard measles.\nDescription\nMeasles infections appear all over the world. Prior\nto the current effective immunization program, large-scale measles outbreaks occurred on a two to three-yearcycle, usually in the winter and spring. Smaller outbreaksoccurred during the off-years. Babies up to about eightmonths of age are usually protected from contractingmeasles, due to immune cells they receive from theirmothers in the uterus. Once someone has had measlesinfection, he or she can never get it again.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2138MeaslesCauses and symptoms\nMeasles is caused by a type of virus called a\nparamyxovirus. It is an extremely contagious infection,spread through the tiny droplets that may spray into theair when an individual carrying the virus sneezes orcoughs. About 85% of those people exposed to the viruswill become infected with it. About 95% of those peopleinfected with the virus will develop the illness calledmeasles. Once someone is infected with the virus, ittakes about 7-18 days before he or she actually becomesill. The most contagious time period is the three to fivedays before symptoms begin through about four daysafter the characteristic measles rash has begun to appear.\nThe first signs of measles infection are fever ,\nextremely runny nose, red, runny eyes, and a cough . A\nfew days later, a rash appears in the mouth, particularlyon the mucous membrane which lines the cheeks. Thisrash consists of tiny white dots (like grains of salt orsand) on a reddish bump. These are called Koplik’s spots,and are unique to measles infection. The throat becomesred, swollen, and sore.\nA couple of days after the appearance of the Kop-\nlik’s spots, the measles rash begins. It appears in a char-acteristic progression, from the head, face, and neck, tothe trunk, then abdomen, and next out along the arms andlegs. The rash starts out as flat, red patches, but eventual-ly develops some bumps. The rash may be somewhatitchy. When the rash begins to appear, the fever usuallyclimbs higher, sometimes reaching as high as 105°F(40.5°C). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , and\nmultiple swollen lymph nodes. The cough is usuallymore problematic at this point, and the patient feelsawful. The rash usually lasts about five days. As it fades,it turns a brownish color, and eventually the affected skinbecomes dry and flaky.\nMany patients (about 5-15%) develop other compli-\ncations. Bacterial infections, such as ear infections, sinusinfections, and pneumonia are common, especially in\nchildren. Other viral infections may also strike thepatient, including croup ,bronchitis ,laryngitis , or viral\npneumonia. Inflammation of the liver, appendix, intes-tine, or lymph nodes within the abdomen may causeother complications. Rarely, inflammations of the heartor kidneys, a drop in platelet count (causing episodes of\ndifficult-to-control bleeding), or reactivation of an oldtuberculosis infection can occur.\nAn extremely serious complication of measles infec-\ntion is swelling of the brain. Called encephalitis , this can\noccur up to several weeks after the basic measles symp-toms have resolved. About one out of every 1,000patients develops this complication, and about 10-15% ofthese patients die. Symptoms include fever, headache ,sleepiness, seizures, and coma . Long-term problems fol-\nlowing recovery from measles encephalitis may includeseizures and mental retardation .\nA very rare complication of measles can occur up to\n10 years following the initial infection. Called subacute\nsclerosing panencephalitis , this is a slowly progressing,\nsmoldering swelling and destruction of the entire brain. Itis most common among people who had measles infec-tion prior to the age of two years. Symptoms includechanges in personality, decreased intelligence withaccompanying school problems, decreased coordination,involuntary jerks and movements of the body. The diseaseprogresses so that the individual becomes increasinglydependent, ultimately becoming bedridden and unawareof his or her surroundings. Blindness may develop, andthe temperature may spike (rise rapidly) and fall unpre-dictably as the brain structures responsible for tempera-ture regulation are affected. Death is inevitable.\nDiagnosis\nMeasles infection is almost always diagnosed based\non its characteristic symptoms, including Koplik’s spots,and a rash which spreads from central body structures outtowards the arms and legs. If there is any doubt as to thediagnosis, then a specimen of body fluids (mucus, urine)can be collected and combined with fluorescent-taggedmeasles virus antibodies. Antibodies are produced by thebody’s immune cells that can recognize and bind to mark-ers (antigens) on the outside of specific organisms, in thiscase the measles virus. Once the fluorescent antibodieshave attached themselves to the measles antigens in thespecimen, the specimen can be viewed under a specialmicroscope to verify the presence of measles virus.\nTreatment\nThere are no treatments available to stop measles\ninfection. Treatment is primarily aimed at helping the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2139Measles\nMeasles on child’s face. (Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Fever and discomfort can betreated with acetaminophen . Children with measles\nshould never be given aspirin , as this has caused the fatal\ndisease Reye’s syndrome in the past. A cool-mist vapor-\nizer may help decrease the cough. Patients should begiven a lot of liquids to drink, in order to avoid dehydra-\ntion from the fever.\nSome studies have shown that children with measles\nencephalitis benefit from relatively large doses of vita-min A.\nAlternative treatment\nBotanical immune enhancement (with echinacea ,\nfor example) can assist the body in working through thisviral infection. Homeopathic support also can be effec-tive throughout the course of the illness. Some specificalternative treatments to soothe patients with measlesinclude the Chinese herbs bupleurum ( Bupleurum chi-\nnense ) and peppermint ( Mentha piperita ), as well as a\npreparation made from empty cicada ( Cryptotympana\natrata ) shells. The itchiness of the rash can be relieved\nwith witch hazel ( Hamamelis virginiana ), chickweed\n(Stellaria media ), or oatmeal baths. The eyes can be\nsoothed with an eyewash made from the herb eyebright(Euphrasia officinalis ). Practitioners of ayurvedic medi-\ncine recommend ginger or clove tea.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for an otherwise healthy, well-nour-\nished child who contracts measles is usually quite good.In developing countries, however, death rates may reach15-25%. Adolescents and adults usually have a more dif-ficult course. Women who contract the disease while\npregnant may give birth to a baby with hearing impair-ment. Although only 1 in 1,000 patients with measleswill develop encephalitis, 10-15% of those who do willdie, and about another 25% will be left with permanentbrain damage.\nPrevention\nMeasles is a highly preventable infection. A very\neffective vaccine exists, made of live measles viruseswhich have been treated so that they cannot cause actualinfection. The important markers on the viruses are intact,however, which causes an individual’s immune system toreact. Immune cells called antibodies are produced, whichin the event of a future infection with measles virus willquickly recognize the organism, and kill it off. Measlesvaccines are usually given at about 15 months of age;because prior to that age, the baby’s immune system isnot mature enough to initiate a reaction strong enough toinsure long-term protection from the virus. A repeat injec-tion should be given at about 10 or 11 years of age. Out-breaks on college campuses have occurred among unim-munized or incorrectly immunized students.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGershon, Anne. “Measles (Rubeola).” In Harrison’s Principles\nof Internal Medicine , ed.

It wasnamed for Johann F. Meckel, a German anatomist whofirst described the structure.\nDescription\nThe diverticulum is most easily described as a blind\npouch that is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct oryolk sac that nourished the early embryo. It contains alllayers of the intestine and may have ectopic tissue pre-sent from either the pancreas or stomach.The rule of 2s is the classical description. It is locat-\ned about 2 ft from the end of the small intestine, is oftenabout 2 in in length, occurs in about 2% of the popula-tion, is twice as common in males as females, and cancontain two types of ectopic tissue—stomach or pan-creas. Many who have a Meckel’s diverticulum neverhave trouble but those that do present in the first twodecades of life and often in the first two years.\nThere are three major complications that may result\nfrom the development of Meckel’s diverticulum. Themost common problem is inflammation or infection thatmimics appendicitis . This diagnosis is defined at the\ntime of surgery for suspected appendicitis. Bleedingcaused by ectopic stomach tissue that results in a bleed-ing ulcer is the second most frequent problem. Bleedingmay be brisk or massive. The third potential complica-tion is obstruction due to intussusception , or a twist\naround a persistent connection to the abdominal wall.This problem presents as a small bowel obstruction,however, the true cause is identified at the time of surgi-cal exploration.\nMeckel’s diverticulum is a developmental defect that\nis present in about 2% of people, but does not alwayscause symptoms. Meckel’s diverticula (plural of divertic-ulum) are found twice as frequently in men as in women.Complications occur three to five times more frequentlyin males.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2141Meckel’s diverticulum\nA close-up image of a patient’s small intestine with a pro-\ntruding sac.This condition, called Meckel’s diverticulum, isa congenital abnormality occurring in 2% of the population,usually males. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\npermission.)Causes and symptoms\nMeckel’s diverticulum is not hereditary. It is a vesti-\ngial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, an embry-onic structure that becomes the intestine. As such, thereis no genetic defect or abnormality.\nSymptoms usually occur in children under 10 years\nof age. There may be bleeding from the rectum, pain and\nvomiting, or simply tiredness and weakness from unno-ticed blood loss. It is common for a Meckel’s diverticu-lum to be mistaken for the much more common diseaseappendicitis. If there is obstruction, the abdomen willdistend and there will be cramping pain and vomiting.\nDiagnosis\nThe situation may be so acute that surgery is needed\non an emergency basis. This is often the case with bowelobstruction. With heavy bleeding or severe pain, whatev-er the cause, surgery is required. The finer points of diag-nosis can be accomplished when the abdomen is open forinspection during a surgical procedure. This situation iscalled an acute abdomen.KEY TERMS\nAppendectomy —The procedure to surgically\nremove an appendix.\nAppendicitis —Inflammation of the appendix.\nAppendix —A portion of intestine attached to the\ncecum.\nCecum —The first part of the large bowel.\nCongenital —Refers to a disorder which is present\nat birth.\nDistal —Away from the point of origin.\nEctopic —Tissue found in an abnormal location.\nIntussusception —One piece of bowel inside\nanother, causing obstruction.\nIsotope —Any of two or more species of atoms of a\nchemical element with the same atomic numberand nearly identical chemical behavior but withdiffering atomic mass and physical properties.\nPeptic ulcer —A wound in the bowel that can be\ncaused by stomach acid or a bacterium calledHelicobacter pylori.\nVolvulus —A twisted loop of bowel, causing\nobstruction.If there is more time (not an emergency situation),\nthe best way to diagnose Meckel’s diverticulum is with anuclear scan. A radioactive isotope injected into thebloodstream will accumulate at sites of bleeding or instomach tissue. If a piece of stomach tissue or a pool ofblood shows up in the lower intestine, Meckel’s divertic-ulum is indicated.\nTreatment\nA Meckel’s diverticulum that is causing discomfort,\nbleeding, or obstruction must be surgically removed.This procedure is very similar to an appendectomy .\nPrognosis\nThe outcome after surgery is usually excellent. The\nsource of bleeding, pain, or obstruction is removed so thesymptoms also disappear. A Meckel’s diverticulum willnot return.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAspinall, Richard J., and Simon T. Taylor-Robinson.

    "content": "Mediastinoscopy\nDefinition\nMediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows\nphysicians to view areas of the mediastinum, the cavitybehind the breastbone that lies between the lungs. Theorgans in the mediastinum include the heart and its ves-sels, the lymph nodes, trachea, esophagus, and thymus.\nMediastinoscopy is most commonly used to detect or\nstage cancer . It is also ordered to detect infection, and to\nconfirm diagnosis of certain conditions and diseases of therespiratory organs. The procedure involves insertion of anendotracheal (within the trachea) tube, followed by a smallincision in the chest. A mediastinoscope is inserted throughthe incision. The purpose of this equipment is to allow thephysician to directly see the organs inside the mediastinum,and to collect tissue samples for laboratory study.\nPurpose\nMediastinoscopy is often the diagnostic method of\nchoice for detecting lymphoma, including Hodgkin’s dis-ease. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis (a chronic lung dis-\nease) and the staging of lung cancer can also be accom-plished through mediastinoscopy. Lung cancer staginginvolves the placement of the cancer’s progression intostages, or levels. These stages help a physician study can-cer and provide consistent definition levels of cancer andcorresponding treatments. The lymph nodes in the medi-astinum are likely to show if lung cancer has spreadbeyond the lungs. Mediastinoscopy allows a physician toobserve and extract a sample from the nodes for furtherstudy. Involvement of these lymph nodes indicates diag-nosis and stages of lung cancer.\nMediastinoscopy may also be ordered to verify a\ndiagnosis that was not clearly confirmed by other meth-ods, such as certain radiographic and laboratory studies.Mediastinoscopy may also aid in certain surgical biop-sies of nodes or cancerous tissue in the mediastinum. Infact, the surgeon may immediately perform a surgicalprocedure if a malignant tumor is confirmed while thepatient is undergoing mediastinoscopy, thus combining\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2143Mediastinoscopy\nMediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure used to detect or\nstage lymphoma or lung cancer. In this procedure, the sur-geon makes an incision below the neck and inserts a medi-astinoscope (a narrow, hollow tube with an attached light)through it to reach the area behind the breastbone.The sur-geon can then insert tools through the scope to collect tis-sue for laboratory analysis. (Illustration by Electronic Illustra-\ntors Group.)the diagnostic exam and surgical procedure into one\noperation when possible.\nAlthough still performed in 2001, advancements in\ncomputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) techniques, as well as the new develop-\nments in ultrasonography, have led to a decline in the useof mediastinoscopy. In addition, better results of fine-needle aspiration (drawing out fluid by suction) andcore-needle biopsy (using a needle to obtain a small tis-sue sample) investigations, along with new techniques inthoracoscopy (examination of the thoracic cavity with a\nlighted instrument called a thoracoscope) offer additionaloptions in examining mediastinal masses. Medi-astinoscopy may be required, however, when these othermethods cannot be used or when the results they provideare inconclusive.\nPrecautions\nBecause mediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure, it\nshould only be performed when the benefits of theexam’s findings outweigh the risks of surgery and anes-thesia. Patients who previously had mediastinoscopyshould not receive it again if there is scarring presentfrom the first exam.\nSeveral other medical conditions, such as impaired\ncerebral circulation, obstruction or distortion of theupper airway, or thoracic aortic aneurysm (abnormal\ndilation of the thoracic aorta) may also preclude medi-KEY TERMS\nEndotracheal —Placed within the trachea, also\nknown as the windpipe.\nHodgkin’s disease —A malignancy of lymphoid tis-\nsue found in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, andbone marrow.\nLymph nodes —Small round structures located\nthroughout the body; contain cells that fight infec-tions.\nPleural space —Space between the layers of the\npleura (membrane lining the lungs and thorax).\nSarcoidosis —A chronic disease characterized by\nnodules in the lungs, skin, lymph nodes andbones; however, any tissue or organ in the bodymay be affected.\nThymus —An unpaired organ in the mediastinal\ncavity that is important in the body’s immuneresponse.astinoscopy. Anatomic structures that can be compressed\nby the mediastinoscope may complicate these pre-exist-ing medical conditions.\nDescription\nMediastinoscopy is usually performed in a hospital\nunder general anesthesia. An endotracheal tube is insert-ed first, after local anesthesia is applied to the throat.Once the patient is under general anesthesia, a small inci-sion is made usually just below the neck or at the notch atthe top of the breastbone. The surgeon may clear a pathand feel the patient’s lymph nodes first to evaluate anyabnormalities within the nodes. Next, the physician willinsert the mediastinoscope through the incision. Thescope is a narrow, hollow tube with an attached light thatallows the surgeon to see inside the area. The surgeoncan insert tools through the hollow tube to help performbiopsies. A sample of tissue from the lymph nodes or amass can be extracted and sent for study under a micro-scope or on to a laboratory for further testing.\nIn some cases, analysis of the tissue sample which\nshows malignancy will suggest the need for immediatesurgery while the patient is already prepared and underanesthesia. In other cases, the surgeon will complete thevisual study and tissue extraction and stitch the small inci-sion closed. The patient will remain in the surgery recoveryarea until it is determined that the effects of anesthesia havelessened and it is safe for the patient to leave the area. Theentire procedure should take about an hour, not countingpreparation and recovery time. Studies have shown thatmediastinoscopy is a safe, thorough, and cost-effectivediagnostic tool with less risk than some other procedures.\nPreparation\nPatients are asked to sign a consent form after hav-\ning reviewed the risks of mediastinoscopy and knownrisks or reactions to anesthesia. The physician will nor-mally instruct the patient to fast from midnight before thetest until after the procedure is completed. A physicianmay also prescribe a sedative the night before the examand before the procedure. Often a local anesthetic will beapplied to the throat to prevent discomfort during place-ment of the endotracheal tube.\nAftercare\nFollowing mediastinoscopy, patients will be careful-\nly monitored to watch for changes in vital signs or indi-cations of complications of the procedure or the anesthe-sia. A patient may have a sore throat from the endotra-\ncheal tube, temporary chest pain , and soreness or tender-\nness at the site of incision.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2144MediastinoscopyRisks\nComplications from the actual mediastinoscopy pro-\ncedure are relatively rare—the overall complication ratein various studies has been 1.3–3.0%. However, the fol-lowing complications, in decreasing order of frequency,have been reported:\n• hemorrhage\n• pneumothorax (air in the pleural space)\n• recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, causing hoarseness• infection• tumor implantation in the wound• phrenic nerve injury (injury to a thoracic nerve)• esophageal injury• chylothorax (chyle—a milky lymphatic fluid—in the\npleural space)\n• air embolism (air bubble)\n• transient hemiparesis ( paralysis on one side of the\nbody)\nThe usual risks associated with general anesthesia\nalso apply to this procedure.\nNormal results\nIn the majority of procedures performed to diagnose\ncancer, a normal result involves evidence of small,smooth, normal-appearing lymph nodes and no abnormaltissue, growths, or signs of infection. In the case of lungcancer staging, results are related to the severity and pro-gression of the cancer.\nAbnormal results\nAbnormal findings may indicate lung cancer, tuber-\nculosis , the spread of disease from one body part to\nanother, sarcoidosis (a disease that causes nodules, usu-ally affecting the lungs), lymphoma (abnormalities in thelymph tissues), and Hodgkin’s disease.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFischbach, Frances Talaska.

    "content": "Meditation\nDefinition\nMeditation is a practice of concentrated focus upon\na sound, object, visualization, the breath, movement, orattention itself in order to increase awareness of the pre-sent moment, reduce stress , promote relaxation, and\nenhance personal and spiritual growth.\nPurpose\nMeditation benefits people with or without acute\nmedical illness or stress. People who meditate regularlyhave been shown to feel less anxiety and depression.\nThey also report that they experience more enjoyment andappreciation of life and that their relationships with othersare improved. Meditation produces a state of deep relax-ation and a sense of balance or equanimity. According toMichael J. Baime, “Meditation cultivates an emotionalstability that allows the meditator to experience intenseemotions fully while simultaneously maintaining per-spective on them.” Out of this experience of emotionalstability, one may gain greater insight and understandingabout one’s thoughts, feelings, and actions. This insight inturn offers the possibility to feel more confident and incontrol of life. Meditation facilitates a greater sense ofcalmness, empathy, and acceptance of self and others.\nMeditation can be used with other forms of medical\ntreatment and is an important complementary therapy forboth the treatment and prevention of many stress-relatedconditions. Regular meditation can reduce the number ofsymptoms experienced by patients with a wide range ofillnesses and disorders. Based upon clinical evidence aswell as theoretical understanding, meditation is consid-ered to be one of the better therapies for panic disorder ,\ngeneralized anxiety disorder , substance dependence\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2145Meditationand abuse, ulcers, colitis, chronic pain ,psoriasis , and\ndysthymic disorder. It is considered to be a valuableadjunctive therapy for moderate hypertension (high\nblood pressure), prevention of cardiac arrest ( heart\nattack ), prevention of atherosclerosis (hardening of\narteries), arthritis (including fibromyalgia ),cancer ,\ninsomnia , migraine, and prevention of stroke . Medita-\ntion may also be a valuable complementary therapy forallergies and asthma because of the role stress plays in\nthese conditions. Meditative practices have been reportedto improve function or reduce symptoms in patients withsome neurological disorders as well. These include peo-ple with Parkinson’s disease , people who experience\nfatigue with multiple sclerosis , and people with epilep-\nsy who are resistant to standard treatment.\nOverall, a 1995 report to the National Institutes of\nHealth on alternative medicine concluded that, “Morethan 30 years of research, as well as the experience of alarge and growing number of individuals and health careproviders, suggests that meditation and similar forms ofrelaxation can lead to better health, higher quality of life,and lowered health care costs...”\nDescription\nOrigins\nMeditation techniques have been practiced for mil-\nlennia. Originally, they were intended to develop spiritu-al understanding, awareness, and direct experience ofultimate reality. The many different religious traditionsin the world have given rise to a rich variety of medita-tive practices. These include the contemplative practicesof Christian religious orders, the Buddhist practice of sit-ting meditation, and the whirling movements of the Sufidervishes. Although meditation is an important spiritualpractice in many religious and spiritual traditions, it canbe practiced by anyone regardless of their religious orcultural background to relieve stress and pain.\nAs Western medical practitioners begin to under-\nstand the mind’s role in health and disease, there hasbeen more interest in the use of meditation in medicine.Meditative practices are increasingly offered in medicalclinics and hospitals as a tool for improving health andquality of life. Meditation has been used as the primarytherapy for treating certain diseases; as an additionaltherapy in a comprehensive treatment plan; and as ameans of improving the quality of life of people withdebilitating, chronic, or terminal illnesses.\nSitting meditation is generally done in an upright\nseated position, either in a chair or cross-legged on acushion on the floor. The spine is straight yet relaxed.Sometimes the eyes are closed. Other times the eyes areopen and gazing softly into the distance or at an object.\nDepending on the type of meditation, the meditator maybe concentrating on the sensation of the movement of thebreath, counting the breath, silently repeating a sound,chanting, visualizing an image, focusing awareness onthe center of the body, opening to all sensory experiencesincluding thoughts, or performing stylized ritual move-ments with the hands.\nMovement meditation can be spontaneous and free-\nform or involve highly structured, choreographed, repeti-tive patterns. Movement meditation is particularly help-ful for those people who find it difficult to remain still.\nGenerally speaking, there are two main types of med-\nitation. These types are concentration meditation andmindfulness meditation. Concentration meditation prac-tices involve focusing attention on a single object. Objectsof meditation can include the breath, an inner or externalimage, a movement pattern (as in tai chi or yoga ), or a\nsound, word, or phrase that is repeated silently (mantra).The purpose of concentrative practices is to learn to focusone’s attention or develop concentration. When thoughtsor emotions arise, the meditator gently directs the mindback to the original object of concentration.\nMindfulness meditation practices involve becoming\naware of the entire field of attention. The meditator isinstructed to be aware of all thoughts, feelings, percep-tions or sensations as they arise in each moment. Mind-fulness meditation practices are enhanced by the medita-tor’s ability to focus and quiet the mind. Many medita-tion practices are a blend of these two forms.\nThe study and application of meditation to health care\nhas focused on three specific approaches: 1. transcenden-tal meditation (TM); 2. The “relaxation response,” a gener-al approach to meditation developed by Dr. Herbert Ben-son; and 3. mindfulness meditation, specifically the pro-gram of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)\ndeveloped by Jon Kabat-Zinn.\nTranscendental meditation\nTM has its origins in the Vedic tradition of India and\nwas introduced to the West by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.TM has been taught to somewhere between two and fourmillion people. It is one of the most widely practicedforms of meditation in the West. TM has been studiedmany times; these studies have produced much of theinformation about the physiology of meditation. In TM,the meditator sits with closed eyes and concentrates on asingle syllable or word (mantra) for 20 minutes at a time,twice a day. When thoughts or feelings arise, the atten-tion is brought back to the mantra. According to CharlesAlexander, an important TM researcher, “During TM,ordinary waking mental activity is said to settle down,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2146Meditationuntil even the subtlest thought is transcended and a com-\npletely unified wholeness of awareness...is experienced.In this silent, self-referential state of pure wakefulness,consciousness is fully awake to itself alone...” TM sup-porters believe that TM practices are more beneficialthan other meditation practices.\nThe relaxation response\nThe relaxation response involves a similar form of\nmental focusing. Dr. Herbert Benson, one of the firstWestern doctors to conduct research on the effects ofmeditation, developed this approach after observing theprofound health benefits of a state of bodily calm he calls“the relaxation response.” In order to elicit this responsein the body, he teaches patients to focus upon the repeti-tion of a word, sound, prayer, phrase, or movement activ-ity (including swimming, jogging, yoga, and even knit-ting) for 10–20 minutes at a time, twice a day. Patientsare also taught not to pay attention to distracting thoughtsand to return their focus to the original repetition. Thechoice of the focused repetition is up to the individual.Instead of Sanskrit terms, the meditator can choose whatis personally meaningful, such as a phrase from a Christ-ian or Jewish prayer.Mindfulness meditation\nMindfulness meditation comes out of traditional\nBuddhist meditation practices. Psychologist Jon Kabat-Zinn has been instrumental in bringing this form ofmeditation into medical settings. In formal mindfulnesspractice, the meditator sits with eyes closed, focusingthe attention on the sensations and movement of thebreath for approximately 45–60 minutes at a time, atleast once a day. Informal mindfulness practice involvesbringing awareness to every activity in daily life. Wan-dering thoughts or distracting feelings are simplynoticed without resisting or reacting to them. Theessence of mindfulness meditation is not what onefocuses on but rather the quality of awareness the medi-tator brings to each moment. According to Kabat-Zinn,“It is this investigative, discerning observation of what-ever comes up in the present moment that is the hall-mark of mindfulness and differentiates it most fromother forms of meditation. The goal of mindfulness isfor you to be more aware, more in touch with life andwhatever is happening in your own body and mind at thetime it is happening— that is, the present moment.” TheMBSR program consists of a series of classes involvingmeditation, movement, and group process. There are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2147Meditation\nMAHARISHI MAHESH YOGI (1911– )\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi is one of the most recog-\nnized spiritual leaders of the world. Almost single-hand-edly, the Maharishi (meaning great sage) brought Easternculture into Western consciousness. He emerged in thelate 1950s in London and the United States as a mission-ary in the cause of Hinduism, the philosophy of which iscalled Vedanta—a belief that “holds that God is to befound in every creature and object, that the purpose ofhuman life is to realize the godliness in oneself and thatreligious truths are universal.”\nBy 1967, the Maharishi became a leader among\nflower-children and an anti-drug advocate. The Mahar-ishi’s sudden popularity was helped along by such earlyfans as the Beatles, Mia Farrow, and Shirley MacLaine.These people, and many others, practiced TranscendentalMeditation (TM), a Hindu-influenced procedure thatendures in America to this day.\nWhen the 1960s drew to a close, the Maharishi\nbegan to fade from public view. The guru still had enoughfollowers, though, to people the Maharishi InternationalUniversity, founded in 1971. One of the main draws ofMaharishi International University was the study of TM-Sidha, an exotic form of Transcendental Meditation. Sid-has believe that group meditation can elicit the maharishieffect—a force strong enough to conjure world peace.\n(Archive. Reproduced by permission.)over 240 MBSR programs offered in health care settings\naround the world.\nMeditation is not considered a medical procedure or\nintervention by most insurers. Many patients pay formeditation training themselves. Frequently, religiousgroups or meditation centers offer meditation instructionfree of charge or for a nominal donation. Hospitals mayoffer MBSR classes at a reduced rate for their patientsand a slightly higher rate for the general public.\nPrecautions\nMeditation appears to be safe for most people. There\nare, however, case reports and studies noting some adverseeffects. Thirty-three to 50% of the people participating inlong silent meditation retreats (two weeks to three months)reported increased tension, anxiety, confusion, and depres-sion. On the other hand, most of these same people alsoreported very positive effects from their meditation prac-tice. Kabat-Zinn notes that these studies fail to differenti-ate between serious psychiatric disturbances and normalemotional mood swings. These studies do suggest, howev-er, that meditation may not be recommended for peoplewith psychotic disorders, severe depression, and othersevere personality disorders unless they are also receiv-\ning psychological or medical treatment.Side effects\nThere are no reported side effects from meditation\nexcept for positive benefits.\nResearch and general acceptance\nThe scientific study of the physiological effects of\nmeditation began in the early 1960s. These studies provethat meditation affects metabolism, the endocrine sys-tem, the central nervous system, and the autonomic ner-vous system. In one study, three advanced practitionersof Tibetan Buddhist meditation practices demonstratedthe ability to increase “inner heat” as much as 61%. Dur-ing a different meditative practice they were able to dra-matically slow down the rate at which their bodies con-sumed oxygen. Preliminary research shows that mindful-ness meditation is associated with increased levels ofmelatonin. These findings suggest a potential role formeditation in the treatment and prevention of breast andprostate cancer.\nDespite the inherent difficulties in designing\nresearch studies, there is a large amount of evidence ofthe medical benefits of meditation. Meditation is particu-larly effective as a treatment for chronic pain. Studieshave shown meditation reduces symptoms of pain andpain-related drug use. In a four-year follow-up study, themajority of patients in a MBSR program reported “mod-erate to great improvement” in pain as a result of partici-pation in the program.\nMeditation has long been recommended as a treat-\nment for high blood pressure; however, there is a debateover the amount of benefit that meditation offers.Although most studies show a reduction in blood pres-sure with meditation, medication is still more effective atlowering high blood pressure.\nMeditation may also be an effective treatment for\ncoronary artery disease . A study of 21 patients prac-\nticing TM for eight months showed increases in theiramount of exercise tolerance, amount of workload, and\na delay in the onset of ST-segment depression. Medita-tion is also an important part of Dean Ornish’s pro-gram, which has been proven to reverse coronaryartery disease.\nResearch also suggests that meditation is effective in\nthe treatment of chemical dependency. Gelderloos andothers reviewed 24 studies and reported that all of themshowed that TM is helpful in programs to stop smoking\nand also in programs for drug and alcohol abuse.\nStudies also imply that meditation is helpful in\nreducing symptoms of anxiety and in treating anxiety-related disorders. Furthermore, a study in 1998 of 37psoriasis patients showed that those practicing mindful-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2148Meditation\nGirl in meditation. (Photograph by Robert J. Huffman.

Another study found that meditationdecreased the symptoms of fibromyalgia; over half of thepatients reported significant improvement.

    "content": "Medullary sponge kidney\nDefinition\nMedullary sponge kidney is a congenital defect of\nthe kidneys where the kidneys fill with pools of urine.\nDescription\nOne of every 100 to 200 people have some form of\nthis disease. The kidneys filter urine from the blood anddirect it down tiny collecting tubes toward the ureters(ducts that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder).These tiny tubes gradually join together until they reach therenal pelvis, where the ureters begin. As the tubes join, theyare supposed to get progressively bigger as they get fewerin number. In medullary sponge kidney, the tubes are irreg-ular in diameter, forming pools of urine along the way.These pools encourage stone formation and infection.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough some cases of this disorder seem to be\ninherited, usually the cause is not known.\nThe symptoms associated with medullary sponge\nkidney are those related to infection and stone passage.Infection causes fever ; back and flank pain ; cloudy, fre-\nquent, and burning urine; and general discomfort. Stonescause pain in the flank or groin as they pass. They usual-ly cause some bleeding.

    "title": "Melioidosis",
    "content": "Melioidosis\nDefinition\nMelioidosis is an infectious disease of humans and\nanimals caused by a gram-negative bacillus found in soiland water. It has both acute and chronic forms.\nDescription\nMelioidosis, which is sometimes called Pseudomonas\npseudomallei infection, is endemic (occurring naturally\nand consistently) in Southeast Asia, Australia, and parts ofAfrica. It was rare in the United States prior to recentimmigration from Southeast Asia. Melioidosis is presentlya public health concern because it is most common inAIDS patients and intravenous drug users.\nCauses and symptoms\nMelioidosis is caused by Pseudomonas pseudoma-\nllei, a bacillus that can cause disease in sheep, goats,\npigs, horses, and other animals, as well as in humans.The organism enters the body through skin abrasions,burns , or wounds infected by contaminated soil; inhala-\ntion of dust; or by eating food contaminated with P.\npseudomallei . Person-to-person transmission is unusual.\nDrug addicts acquire the disease from shared needles.The incubation period is two to three days.\nChronic melioidosis is characterized by osteomyelitis\n(inflammation of the bone) and pus-filled abscesses in theskin, lungs, or other organs. Acute melioidosis takes oneof three forms: a localized skin infection that may spreadto nearby lymph nodes; an infection of the lungs associat-ed with high fever (102°F/38.9°C), headache , chest pain,\nand coughing; and septicemia (blood poisoning ) charac-\nterized by disorientation, difficulty breathing, severeheadache, and an eruption of pimples on the head or trunk.The third form is most common among drug addicts andmay be rapidly fatal.\nDiagnosis\nMelioidosis is usually suspected based on the\npatient’s history, especially travel, occupational exposure\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2150Melioidosisto infected animals, or a history of intravenous drug use.\nDiagnosis must then be confirmed through laboratorytests. P . pseudomallei can be cultured from samples of\nthe patient’s sputum, blood, or tissue fluid from abscess-es. Blood tests, including complement fixation (CF) testsand hemagglutination tests, also help to confirm thediagnosis. In acute infections, chest x rays and liver\nfunction tests are usually abnormal.\nTreatment\nPatients with mild or moderate infections are given a\ncourse of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)and ceftazidime by mouth. Patients with acute melioido-sis are given a lengthy course of ceftazidime followed byTMP/SMX. In patients with acute septicemia, a combi-nation of antibiotics is administered intravenously, usu-\nally tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and TMP/SMX.\nPrognosis\nThe mortality rate in acute cases of pulmonary melioi-\ndosis is about 10%; the mortality rate for the septicemicform is significantly higher (slightly above 50%). Theprognosis for recovery from mild infections is excellent.\nPrevention\nThere is no form of immunization for melioidosis.\nPrevention requires prompt cleansing of scrapes, burns, orother open wounds in areas where the disease is commonand avoidance of needle sharing among drug addicts.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Bacterial Diseases: Melioidosis.” In The Merck Manual of\nDiagnosis and Therapy. 16th ed.

It is an abnormality within the inner ear. A fluidcalled endolymph moves in the membranous labyrinth orsemicircular canals within the bony labyrinth inside theinner ear. When the head or body moves, the endolymphmoves, causing nerve receptors in the membranouslabyrinth to send signals to the brain about the body’smotion. A change in the volume of the endolymph fluid,or swelling or rupture of the membranous labyrinth isthought to result in Meniere’s disease symptoms.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of Meniere’s disease is unknown; howev-\ner, scientists are studying several possible causes includ-ing noise pollution, viral infections, or other biologicalfactors. The symptoms are associated with a change influid volume within the labyrinth of the inner ear.\nSymptoms include severe dizziness or vertigo, tinni-\ntus, hearing loss, and the sensation of pain or pressure in\nthe affected ear. Symptoms appear suddenly, last up toseveral hours, and can occur as often as daily to as infre-quently as once a year. A typical attack includes vertigo,tinnitus and hearing loss; however, some individuals withMeniere’s disease may experience a single symptom, likean occasional bout of slight dizziness or periodic, intenseringing in the ear. Attacks of severe vertigo can force thesufferer to have to sit or lie down, and may be accompa-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2151Meniere’s diseasenied by headache , nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea . Hear-\ning tends to recover between attacks, but becomes pro-gressively worse over time.\nMeniere’s disease usually starts between the ages of\n20 and 50 years and affects men and women in equalnumbers. In most patients, only one ear is affected, but inabout 15% of patients, both ears are involved.\nDiagnosis\nAn estimated 3 to 5 million people in the United\nStates have Meniere’s disease, and almost 100,000 newcases are diagnosed each year. Diagnosis is based onmedical history, physical examination , hearing and bal-\nance tests, and medical imaging with magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI).\nSeveral types of tests may be used to diagnose the dis-\nease and to evaluate the extent of hearing loss. In patientswith Meniere’s disease, audiometric tests (hearing tests)usually indicate a sensory type of hearing loss in theaffected ear. Speech discrimination or the ability to distin-guish between words that sound alike is often diminished.In about 50% of patients, the balance function is reducedin the affected ear. An electronystagnograph (ENG) maybe used to evaluate balance. Since the eyes and ears worktogether through the nervous system to coordinate bal-ance, measurement of eye movements can be used to testthe balance system. For this test, the patient is seated in adarkened room and recording electrodes, similar to thoseused with a heart monitor, are placed near the eyes. Warmand cool water or air are gently introduced into the eachear canal and eye movements are recorded.\nAnother test that may be used is an electrocochleo-\ngraph (EcoG), which can measure increased inner earfluid pressure.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for Meniere’s disease, but medica-\ntion, surgery, and dietary and behavioral changes, canhelp control or improve the symptoms.\nMedications\nSymptoms of Meniere’s disease may be treated with\na variety of oral or injectable medications. Antihista-\nmines , like diphenhydramine, meclizine, and cyclizine\ncan be prescribed to sedate the vestibular system. A bar-biturate medication like pentobarbital may be used tocompletely sedate the patient and relieve the vertigo.Anticholinergic drugs, like atropine or scopolamine, canhelp minimize nausea and vomiting . Diazepam has\nbeen found to be particularly effective for relief of verti-go and nausea in Meniere’s disease.There have been some reports of successful control\nof vertigo after antibiotics (gentamicin or streptomycin)\nor a steroid medication (dexamethasone) are injecteddirectly into the inner ear. This procedure is done in thedoctor’s office and is less expensive and less invasivethan a surgical procedure.\nSurgical procedures\nSurgical procedures may be recommended if the\nvertigo attacks are frequent, severe, or disabling and can-not be controlled by other treatments. The most commonsurgical treatment is insertion of a small tube or shunt todrain some of the fluid from the canal. This treatmentusually preserves hearing and controls vertigo in aboutone-half to two-thirds of cases, but it is not a permanentcure in all patients.\nThe vestibular nerve leads from the inner ear to the\nbrain and is responsible for conducting nerve impulsesrelated to balance. A vestibular neurectomy is a proce-dure where this nerve is cut so the distorted impulsescausing dizziness no longer reach the brain. This proce-dure permanently cures the majority of patients and hear-ing is preserved in most cases. There is a slight risk thathearing or facial muscle control will be affected.\nA labyrinthectomy is a surgical procedure in which\nthe balance and hearing mechanism in the inner ear aredestroyed on one side. This procedure is consideredwhen the patient has poor hearing in the affected ear.Labyrinthectomy results in the highest rates of control ofvertigo attacks, however, it also causes complete deaf-ness in the affected ear.\nAlternative treatment\nChanges in diet and behavior are sometimes recom-\nmended. Eliminating caffeine , alcohol, and salt may\nrelieve the frequency and intensity of attacks in somepeople with Meniere’s disease. Reducing stress levels\nand eliminating tobacco use may also help.\nPrognosis\nMeniere’s disease is a complex and unpredictable\ncondition for which there is no cure. The vertigo associ-ated with the disease can generally be managed or elimi-nated with medications and surgery. Hearing tends tobecome worse over time, and some of the surgical proce-dures recommended, in fact, cause deafness.\nPrevention\nSince the cause of Meniere’s disease is unknown,\nthere are no current strategies for its prevention. Researchcontinues on the environmental and biological factors that\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2152Meniere’s diseasemay cause Meniere’s disease or induce an attack, as well\nas on the physiological components of the fluid andlabyrinth system involved in hearing and balance.

Meningitis is most commonly\ncaused by infection (by bacteria, viruses, or fungi),although it can also be caused by bleeding into themeninges, cancer , diseases of the immune system, and\nan inflammatory response to certain types of chemother-\napyor other chemical agents. The most serious and diffi-\ncult-to-treat types of meningitis tend to be those causedby bacteria.\nDescription\nMeningitis is a particularly dangerous infection\nbecause of the very delicate nature of the brain. Braincells are some of the only cells in the body that, oncekilled, will not regenerate themselves. Therefore, ifenough brain tissue is damaged by an infection, serious,life-long handicaps will remain.\nIn order to learn about meningitis, it is important to\nhave a basic understanding of the anatomy of the brain.The meninges are three separate membranes, layeredtogether, which encase the brain and spinal cord:\n• The dura is the toughest, outermost layer, and is closely\nattached to the inside of the skull.\n• The middle layer, the arachnoid, is important because\nof its involvement in the normal flow of the cere-brospinal fluid (CSF), a lubricating and nutritive fluidthat bathes both the brain and the spinal cord.\n• The innermost layer, the pia, helps direct blood vessels\ninto the brain.\n• The space between the arachnoid and the pia contains\nCSF, which helps insulate the brain from trauma. Manyblood vessels course through this space.\nCSF, produced within specialized chambers deep\ninside the brain, flows over the surface of the brain andspinal cord. This fluid serves to cushion these relativelydelicate structures, as well as supplying important nutri-ents for brain cells. CSF is reabsorbed by blood vesselslocated within the meninges. A careful balance betweenCSF production and reabsorption is important to avoidthe accumulation of too much CSF.\nBecause the brain is enclosed in the hard, bony case\nof the skull, any disease that produces swelling will bedamaging to the brain. The skull cannot expand at all, sowhen the swollen brain tissue pushes up against the skull’shard bone, the brain tissue becomes damaged and mayultimately die. Furthermore, swelling on the right side ofthe brain will not only cause pressure and damage to thatside of the brain, but by taking up precious space withinthe tight confines of the skull, the left side of the brain willalso be pushed up against the hard surface of the skull,causing damage to the left side of the brain as well.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2153MeningitisAnother way that infections injure the brain involves\nthe way in which the chemical environment of the brainchanges in response to the presence of an infection. Thecells of the brain require a very well-regulated environ-ment. Careful balance of oxygen, carbon dioxide, sugar(glucose), sodium, calcium, potassium, and other sub-stances must be maintained in order to avoid damage tobrain tissue. An infection upsets this balance, and braindamage can occur when the cells of the brain are eitherdeprived of important nutrients or exposed to toxic levelsof particular substances.\nThe cells lining the brain’s tiny blood vessels (capil-\nlaries) are specifically designed to prevent many sub-stances from passing into brain tissue. This is commonlyreferred to as the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brainbarrier prevents various substances that could be poiso-nous to brain tissue (toxins), as well as many agents ofinfection, from crossing from the blood stream into thebrain tissue. While this barrier is obviously an importantprotective feature for the brain, it also serves to compli-cate treatment in the case of an infection by making itdifficult for medications to pass out of the blood and intothe brain tissue where the infection is located.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common infectious causes of meningitis\nvary according to an individual’s age, habits, living envi-ronment, and health status. While nonbacterial types ofmeningitis are more common, bacterial meningitis is themore potentially life-threatening. Three bacterial agentsare responsible for about 80% of all bacterial meningitiscases. These bacteria are Haemophilus influenzae type b,\nNeisseria meningitidis (causing meningococcal meningi-\ntis), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (causing pneumo-\ncoccal meningitis).\nIn newborns, the most common agents of meningitis\nare those that are contracted from the newborn’s mother,including Group B streptococci (becoming an increas-ingly common infecting organism in the newborn peri-od), Escherichia coli , and Listeria monocytogenes . The\nhighest incidence of meningitis occurs in babies under amonth old, with an increased risk of meningitis continu-ing through about two years of age.\nOlder children are more frequently infected by the\nbacteria Haemophilus influenzae ,Neisseria meningitidis ,\nand Streptococci pneumoniae .\nAdults are most commonly infected by either S.\npneumoniae or N. meningitidis , with pneumococcal\nmeningitis the more common. Certain conditions predis-pose to this type of meningitis, including alcoholism and\nchronic upper respiratory tract infections (especially ofthe middle ear, sinuses, and mastoids).N. meningitidis is the only organism that can cause\nepidemics of meningitis. In particular, these haveoccurred when a child in a crowded day-care situation ora military recruit in a crowded training camp has fallenill with meningococcal meningitis.\nViral causes of meningitis include the herpes sim-\nplex virus, the mumps and measles viruses (against\nwhich most children are protected due to mass immu-nization programs), the virus that causes chicken pox, therabies virus, and a number of viruses that are acquired\nthrough the bites of infected mosquitoes.\nA number of medical conditions predispose individ-\nuals to meningitis caused by specific organisms. Patientswith AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are\nmore prone to getting meningitis from fungi, as well asfrom the agent that causes tuberculosis . Patients who\nhave had their spleens removed, or whose spleens are nolonger functional (as in the case of patients with sickle\ncell disease ) are more susceptible to other infections,\nincluding meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis.\nThe majority of meningitis infections are acquired by\nblood-borne spread. A person may have another type ofinfection (of the lungs, throat, or tissues of the heart)caused by an organism that can also cause meningitis. Ifthis initial infection is not properly treated, the organismwill continue to multiply, find its way into the bloodstream, and be delivered in sufficient quantities to invadepast the blood brain barrier. Direct spread occurs when anorganism spreads to the meninges from infected tissue nextto or very near the meninges. This can occur, for example,with a severe, poorly treated ear or sinus infection.\nPatients who suffer from skull fractures possess\nabnormal openings to the sinuses, nasal passages, andmiddle ears. Organisms that usually live in the humanrespiratory system without causing disease can passthrough openings caused by such fractures, reach themeninges, and cause infection. Similarly, patients whoundergo surgical procedures or who have had foreignbodies surgically placed within their skulls (such as tubesto drain abnormal amounts of accumulated CSF) have anincreased risk of meningitis.\nOrganisms can also reach the meninges via an\nuncommon but interesting method called intraneuralspread. This involves an organism invading the body at aconsiderable distance away from the head, spreadingalong a nerve, and using that nerve as a kind of ladderinto the skull, where the organism can multiply andcause meningitis. Herpes simplex virus is known to usethis type of spread, as is the rabies virus.\nThe most classic symptoms of meningitis (particu-\nlarly of bacterial meningitis) include fever ,headache ,\nvomiting, sensitivity to light (photophobia), irritability,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2154Meningitissevere fatigue (lethargy), stiff neck, and a reddish purple\nrash on the skin. Untreated, the disease progresses withseizures, confusion, and eventually coma .\nA very young infant may not show the classic signs\nof meningitis. Early in infancy, a baby’s immune systemis not yet developed enough to mount a fever in responseto infection, so fever may be absent. Some infants withmeningitis have seizures as their only identifiable symp-tom. Similarly, debilitated elderly patients may not havefever or other identifiable symptoms of meningitis.\nDamage due to meningitis occurs from a variety of\nphenomena. The action of infectious agents on the braintissue is one direct cause of damage. Other types of dam-age may be due to the mechanical effects of swelling andcompression of brain tissue against the bony surface ofthe skull. Swelling of the meninges may interfere with thenormal absorption of CSF by blood vessels, causing accu-mulation of CSF and damage from the resulting pressure\non the brain. Interference with the brain’s carefully regu-lated chemical environment may cause damagingamounts of normally present substances (carbon dioxide,potassium) to accumulate. Inflammation may cause theblood-brain barrier to become less effective at preventingthe passage of toxic substances into brain tissue.\nDiagnosis\nA number of techniques are used when examining a\npatient suspected of having meningitis to verify the diag-nosis. Certain manipulations of the head (lowering thehead, chin towards chest, for example) are difficult toperform and painful for a patient with meningitis.\nThe most important test used to diagnose meningitis\nis the lumbar puncture (commonly called a spinal tap).Lumbar puncture (LP) involves the insertion of a thin nee-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2155Meningitis\nHATTIE ALEXANDER (1901–1968)\nHattie Alexander, a dedicated pediatrician, medical\neducator, and researcher in microbiology, won interna-tional recognition for deriving a serum to combat influen-zal meningitis, a common disease that previously hadbeen nearly always fatal to infants and young children.Alexander subsequently investigated microbiologicalgenetics and the processes whereby bacteria, throughgenetic mutation, acquire resistance to antibiotics. In1964, as president of the American Pediatric Society, she\nbecame one of the first women to head a national med-ical association.\nAs an intern at the Harriet Lane Home of Johns Hop-\nkins Hospital from 1930 to 1931, Alexander becameinterested in influenzal meningitis. The source of the dis-ease was Hemophilus influenzae , a bacteria that causes\ninflammation of the meninges, the membranes surround-ing the brain and spinal cord. In 1931, Alexander began asecond internship at the Babies Hospital of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. There, shewitnessed first-hand the futility of medical efforts to savebabies who had contracted influenzal meningitis.\nAlexander’s early research focused on deriving a\nserum (the liquid component of blood, in which antibodiesare contained) that would be effective against influenzalmeningitis. Serums derived from animals that have beenexposed to a specific disease-producing bacterium oftencontain antibodies against the disease and can be devel-oped for use in immunizing humans against it. Alexanderknew that the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, how-ever, had been able to prepare a rabbit serum for the treat-ment of pneumonia, another bacterial disease. Alexandertherefore experimented with rabbit serums, and by 1939was able to announce the development of a rabbit serumeffective in curing infants of influenzal meningitis.\nIn the early 1940s, Alexander experimented with the\nuse of drugs in combination with rabbit serum in thetreatment of influenzal meningitis. Within the next twoyears, she saw infant deaths due to the disease drop byeighty percent.\n(Betmann/CORBIS.

The CSF isthen examined under a microscope to look for bacteria orfungi. Normal CSF contains set percentages of glucoseand protein. These percentages will vary with bacterial,viral, or other causes of meningitis. For example, bacterialmeningitis causes a greatly lower than normal percentageof glucose to be present in CSF, as the bacteria are essen-tially “eating” the host’s glucose, and using it for their ownnutrition and energy production. Normal CSF should\ncontain no infection-fighting cells (white blood cells), sothe presence of white blood cells in CSF is another indica-tion of meningitis. Some of the withdrawn CSF is also putinto special lab dishes to allow growth of the infectingorganism, which can then be identified more easily. Spe-cial immunologic and serologic tests may also be used tohelp identify the infectious agent.\nIn rare instances, CSF from a lumbar puncture can-\nnot be examined because the amount of swelling withinthe skull is so great that the pressure within the skull(intracranial pressure) is extremely high. This pressure isKEY TERMS\nBlood-brain barrier —An arrangement of cells\nwithin the blood vessels of the brain that preventsthe passage of toxic substances, including infec-tious agents, from the blood and into the brain.

If it is found to be very high, no fluid is with-drawn because doing so could cause herniation of thebrain stem. Herniation of the brain stem occurs when thepart of the brain connecting to the spinal cord is thrustthrough the opening at the base of the skull into thespinal canal. Such herniation will cause compression ofthose structures within the brain stem that control themost vital functions of the body (breathing, heart beat,consciousness). Death or permanent debilitation follows\nherniation of the brain stem.\nTreatment\nAntibiotic medications (forms of penicillin and\ncephalosporins , for example) are the most important\nelement of treatment against bacterial agents of meningi-tis. Because of the effectiveness of the blood-brain barri-er in preventing the passage of substances into the brain,medications must be delivered directly into the patient’sveins (intravenously, or by IV), at very high doses.Antiviral drugs (acyclovir) may be helpful in shortening\nthe course of viral meningitis, and antifungal medica-tions are available as well.\nOther treatments for meningitis involve decreasing\ninflammation (with steroid preparations) and paying care-ful attention to the balance of fluids, glucose, sodium,potassium, oxygen, and carbon dioxide in the patient’ssystem. Patients who develop seizures will require med-ications to halt the seizures and prevent their return.\nPrognosis\nViral meningitis is the least severe type of meningi-\ntis, and patients usually recover with no long-term effectsfrom the infection. Bacterial infections, however, aremuch more severe, and progress rapidly. Without veryrapid treatment with the appropriate antibiotic, the infec-tion can swiftly lead to coma and death in less than aday’s time. While death rates from meningitis varydepending on the specific infecting organism, the overalldeath rate is just under 20%.\nThe most frequent long-term effects of meningitis\ninclude deafness and blindness, which may be caused bythe compression of specific nerves and brain areasresponsible for the senses of hearing and sight. Somepatients develop permanent seizure disorders, requiringlife-long treatment with anti-seizure medications. Scar-ring of the meninges may result in obstruction of the nor-mal flow of CSF, causing abnormal accumulation ofCSF. This may be a chronic problem for some patients,requiring the installation of shunt tubes to drain the accu-mulation regularly.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2156MeningitisPrevention\nPrevention of meningitis primarily involves the\nappropriate treatment of other infections an individualmay acquire, particularly those that have a track recordof seeding to the meninges (such as ear and sinus infec-tions).

    "content": "Meningococcemia\nDefinition\nMeningococcemia is the presence of meningococcus\nin the bloodstream. Meningococcus, a bacteria formallycalled Neisseria meningitidis , can be one of the most dra-\nmatic and rapidly fatal of all infectious diseases.Causes and symptoms\nMeningococcemia, a relatively uncommon infection,\noccurs most commonly in children and young adults. Insusceptible people, it may cause a very severe illness thatcan produce death within hours. The bacteria, which can\nspread from person to person, usually first causes a colo-nization in the upper airway, but without symptoms. Fromthere, it can penetrate into the bloodstream to the centralnervous system and cause meningitis or develop into a\nfull-blown bloodstream infection (meningococcemia).Fortunately in most colonized people, this does not hap-pen and the result of this colonization is long-lastingimmunity against the particular strain.\nAfter colonization is established, symptoms can devel-\nop within one day to one to two weeks. After a short periodof time (one hour up to one to two days) when the patientcomplains of fever and muscle aches, more severe symp-\ntoms can develop. Unfortunately during this early stage, adoctor cannot tell this illness from any other illness, such asa viral infection like influenza . Unless the case is occurring\nin a person known to have been exposed to or in the midstof an epidemic of meningococcal disease, there may be nospecific symptoms or signs found that help the doctor diag-nose the problem. Rarely, a low-grade bloodstream infec-tion called chronic meningococcemia can occur.\nAfter this initial period, the patient will often com-\nplain of continued fever, shaking chills, overwhelmingweakness, and even a feeling of impending doom. Theorganism is multiplying in the bloodstream, unchecked bythe immune system. The severity of the illness and its direcomplications are caused by the damage the organismdoes to the small blood vessel walls. This damage is called\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2157Meningococcemia\nA close-up image of a person’s hand with meningococ-\ncemia.This disease is caused by the presence of meningo-coccus ( Neisseria meningitidis ) in the bloodstream.The\norganism can cause multiple illnesses and can damagesmall blood vessels. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-\nduced by permission.)a vasculitis , an inflammation of a blood vessel. Damage to\nthe small vessels causes them to become leaky. The firstsigns of the infection’s severity are small bleeding spotsseen on the skin (petechiae). A doctor should always sus-pect meningococcemia when he/she finds an acutely illpatient with fever, chills, and petechiae.\nQuickly (within hours), the blood vessel damage\nincreases and large bleeding areas on the skin (purpura)are seen. The same changes are taking place in the affect-ed person’s internal organs. The blood pressure is oftenlow and there may be signs of bleeding from otherorgans (like coughing up blood, nose bleeds, blood in theurine). The organism not only damages the blood vesselsby causing them to leak, but also causes clotting insidethe vessels. If this clotting occurs in the larger arteries, itresults in major tissue damage. Essentially, large areas ofskin, muscle, and internal organs die from lack of bloodand oxygen. Even if the disease is quickly diagnosed andtreated, the patient has a high risk of dying.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of meningococcemia can be made by\nthe growth of the organism from blood cultures. Treat-ment should begin when the diagnosis is suspected andshould not be delayed waiting for positive cultures.Obtaining fluid from a petechial spot and staining it inthe laboratory can assist in quickly seeing the organism.\nTreatment\nImmediate treatment of a suspected case of mening-\nococcemia begins with antibiotics that work against theKEY TERMS\nBlood culture —A procedure where blood is col-\nlected from a vein and is placed in a small bottlethat contains a special liquid; the liquid will makeany organisms that are present in the blood sam-ple grow.

Possible choices include penicillin G, ceftriax-\none (Rocephin), cefotaxime (Claforan), or trimetho-prim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra). If the patient isdiagnosed in a doctor’s office, antibiotics should be givenimmediately if possible, even before transfer to the hos-pital and even if cultures cannot be obtained before treat-ment. It is most likely that the speed of initial treatmentwill affect the ultimate outcome.\nPrognosis\nAs many as 15-20% of patients with meningococ-\ncemia will die as a result of the acute infection. A signifi-cant percentage of the survivors will have tissue damagethat requires surgical treatment. This treatment may con-sist of skin grafts, or even partial or full amputations ofan arm or leg. Certain people with immune systemdefects (particularly those with defects in the comple-ment system) may have recurrent episodes of meningo-coccemia. These patients, however, seem to have a lessserious outcome.\nPrevention\nAlthough a vaccine is available for meningococcus, it\nis still difficult at this time to produce a vaccine for thetype B organism, the most common one in the UnitedStates. Because of this and the short time that the vaccineseems to offer protection, the product has not been rou-tinely used in the United States. It can be used for travel-ers going to areas where meningococcal disease is morecommon or is epidemic. Recently, the vaccine has beensuggested for use in incoming college freshman, particu-larly those living in dormitories. These students appear tohave a somewhat higher risk of meningococcal infections.\nIt is, however, recommended that all people take cer-\ntain antibiotics if they have had contact (like at home orin a daycare) with a person who has meningococcalinfection. The most common antibiotics given arerifampin (Rifadin) or ciprofloxacin (Cipro). These medi-cines are usually taken by mouth twice a day for twodays. This treatment will decrease the risk of infection inthese people who have been exposed. However, the over-all risk to people who have been exposed, even withoutantibiotic use, is probably no more than 1-2%.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nCenters for Disease Control. “Recommendation of the Immu-\nnization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP): Meningo-coccal Vaccines.” Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\n34(May 10, 1985): 255-259.\nDevine, L.

    "title": "Menopause",
    "content": "Menopause\nDefinition\nMenopause represents the end of menstruation.\nWhile technically it refers to the final period, it is not anabrupt event, but a gradual process. Menopause is not adisease that needs to be cured, but a natural life-stagetransition. However, women have to make importantdecisions about “treatment,” including the use of hor-\nmone replacement therapy (HRT).\nDescription\nMany women have irregular periods and other prob-\nlems of “pre-menopause” for years. It’s not easy to pre-dict when menopause begins, although doctors agree it iscomplete when a woman has not had a period for a year.Eight out of every 100 women stop menstruating beforeage 40. At the other end of the spectrum, five out of every100 continue to have periods until they are almost 60.The average age of menopause is 51.\nThere’s no mathematical formula to figure out when\nthe ovaries will begin to scale back either, but a womancan get a general idea based on her family history, bodytype, and lifestyle. Women who began menstruatingearly will not necessarily stop having periods early aswell. It is true that a woman will likely enter menopauseat about the same age as her mother. Menopause mayoccur later than average among smokers.\nCauses and symptoms\nOnce a woman enters puberty , each month her body\nreleases one of the more than 400,000 eggs that arestored in her ovaries, and the lining of the womb (uterus)thickens in anticipation of receiving a fertilized egg. Ifthe egg isn’t fertilized, progesterone levels drop and theuterine lining sheds and bleeds.\nBy the time a woman reaches her late 30s or 40s, her\novaries begin to shut down, producing less estrogen andprogesterone and releasing eggs less often. The gradualdecline of estrogen causes a wide variety of changes intissues that respond to estrogen—including the vagina,vulva, uterus, bladder, urethra, breasts, bones, heart,blood vessels, brain, skin, hair, and mucous membranes.Over the long run, the lack of estrogen can make awoman more vulnerable to osteoporosis (which can\nbegin in the 40s) and heart disease.\nAs the levels of hormones fluctuate, the menstrual\ncycle begins to change. Some women may have longerperiods with heavy flow followed by shorter cycles andhardly any bleeding. Others will begin to miss periodscompletely. During this time, a woman also becomes lessable to get pregnant.\nThe most common symptom of menopause is a\nchange in the menstrual cycle, but there are a variety ofother symptoms as well, including:\n• hot flashes\n• night sweats•insomnia\n• mood swings/irritability• memory or concentration problems• vaginal dryness\n• heavy bleeding\n•fatigue\n• depression• hair changes• headaches• heart palpitations\n• sexual disinterest\n• urinary changes• weight gain\nDiagnosis\nThe clearest indication of menopause is the absence\nof a period for one year. It is also possible to diagnosemenopause by testing hormone levels. One important testmeasures the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH).\nHowever, as a woman first enters menopause, her\nhormones often fluctuate wildly from day to day. Forexample, if a woman’s estrogen levels are high and prog-esterone is low, she may have mood swings, irritability,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2159Menopauseand other symptoms similar to premenstrual syndrome\n(PMS). As hormone levels shift and estrogen level falls,hot flashes occur. Because of these fluctuations, a normalhormone level when the blood is tested may not neces-sarily mean the levels were normal the day before or willbe the day after.\nIf it has been at least three months since a woman’s\nlast period, an FSH test might be more helpful in deter-mining whether menopause has occurred. Most doctorsbelieve that the FSH test alone can’t be used as proof thata woman has entered early menopause. A better measureof menopause is a test that checks the levels of estrogen,progesterone, testosterone and other hormones at mid-cycle, in addition to FSH.\nTreatment\nWhen a woman enters menopause, her levels of\nestrogen drop and symptoms (such as hot flashes andvaginal dryness) begin. Hormone replacement therapycan treat these symptoms by boosting the estrogen levelsenough to suppress symptoms while also providing pro-tection against heart disease and osteoporosis, whichcauses the bones to weaken. Experts disagree on whetherHRT increases or decreases the risk of developing breast\ncancer . A Harvard study concluded that short-term use\nof hormones carries little risk, while HRT used for morethan five years among women 55 and over seems toincrease the risk of breast cancer .\nThere are two types of hormone treatments: hor-\nmone replacement therapy (HRT) and estrogen replace-ment therapy (ERT). HRT is the administration of estro-gen and progesterone; ERT is the administration of estro-gen alone. Only women who have had a hysterectomy\n(removal of the uterus) can take estrogen alone, sincetaking this “unopposed” estrogen can cause uterine can-cer. The combination of progesterone and estrogen inHRT eliminates the risk of uterine cancer.\nMost physicians do not recommend HRT until a\nwoman’s periods have stopped completely for one year.This is because women in early menopause who stillhave an occasional period are still producing estrogen;HRT would then provide far too much estrogen.\nMost doctors believe that every woman (except\nthose with certain cancers) should take hormones as theyapproach menopause because of the protection againstheart disease, osteoporosis, and uterine cancer and therelatively low risk of breast cancer. Heart disease andosteoporosis are two of the leading causes of disabilityand death among post-menopausal women.\nCritics say the benefit of taking hormonal drugs to\nease symptoms isn’t worth the risk of breast cancer.Since menopause isn’t a disease, many argue that women\nshouldn’t take hormones to cure what is actually a natur-al process of aging . Advocates of HRT contend that the\npurpose of taking hormones is not to “treat” menopausebut to prevent the development of other diseases.\nThere are risks with HRT and there are risks without\nit. In order to decide whether to take HRT, a womanshould balance her risk of getting breast cancer againsther risk of getting heart disease, and decide how bad hermenopause symptoms are. Most doctors agree that short-term use of estrogen for those women with symptoms ofhot flashes or night sweats is a sensible choice as long asthey don’t have a history of breast cancer.\nFor a woman who has no family history of cancer\nand a high risk of dying from heart disease, for example,the low risk of cancer might be worth the protective ben-efit of avoiding heart disease. Certainly, for Caucasianwomen aged 50 to 94, the risk of dying from heart dis-ease is far greater than the risk of dying of breast cancer.\nWomen are poor candidates for hormone replace-\nment therapy if they have:\n• had breast or endometrial cancer\n• a close relative (mother, sister, grandmother) who died\nof breast cancer or have two relatives who got breastcancer before age 40\n• had endometrial cancer\n• had gallbladder or liver disease• blood clots or phlebitis\nSome women with liver or gallbladder disease, or\nwho have clotting problems, may be able to go on HRT ifthey use a patch to administer the hormones through theskin, bypassing the liver.\nWomen would make a good candidate for HRT if\nthey:\n• need to prevent osteoporosis• have had their ovaries removed\n• need to prevent heart disease\n• have significant symptoms\nTaking hormones can almost immediately eliminate\nhot flashes, vaginal dryness, urinary incontinence\n(depending on the cause), insomnia, moodiness, memoryproblems, heavy irregular periods, and concentrationproblems. Side effects of treatment include bloating,breakthrough bleeding, headaches, vaginal discharge,fluid retention, swollen breasts, or nausea. Up to 20% ofwomen who try hormone replacement stop within ninemonths because of these side effects. However, someside effects can be lessened or prevented by changing theHRT regimen.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2160MenopauseThe decision should be made by a woman and her\ndoctor after taking into consideration her medical historyand situation. Women who choose to take hormonesshould have an annual mammogram, breast exam, andpelvic exam and should report any unusual vaginal\nbleeding or spotting (a sign of possible uterine cancer).\nAnti-estrogens\nA new type of hormone therapy offers some of the\nsame protection against heart disease and bone loss asestrogen, but without the increased risk of breast can-cer. This new class of drugs are known as anti-estro-gens. The best known of these anti-estrogens is ralox-ifene, which mimics the effects of estrogen in thebones and blood, but blocks some of its negativeeffects elsewhere. It’s called an anti-estrogen becausefor a long time these drugs had been used to counterthe harmful effects of estrogen that caused breast can-cer. Oddly enough, in other parts of the body theseKEY TERMS\nEndometrium —The lining of the uterus that is shed\nwith each menstrual period.\nEstrogen —Female hormone produced by the\novaries and released by the follicles as they mature.Responsible for female sexual characteristics, estro-gen stimulates and triggers a response from at least300 tissues, and may help some types of breast can-cer to grow. After menopause, the production of thehormone gradually stops.\nEstrogen replacement therapy (ERT) —A treatment\nfor menopause in which estrogen is given in pill,patch, or cream form.\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) —The pituitary\nhormone that stimulates the ovary to mature eggcapsules (follicles). It is linked with rising estrogenproduction throughout the cycle. An elevated FSH(above 40) indicates menopause.\nHormone —A chemical messenger secreted by a\ngland that is released into the blood, and that trav-els to distant cells where it exerts an effect.\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) —The use of\nestrogen and progesterone to replace hormones thatthe ovary no longer supplies.\nHot flash —A wave of heat that is one of the most\ncommon perimenopausal symptoms, triggered bythe hypothalamus’ response to estrogen withdrawal.Hysterectomy —Surgical removal of the uterus.\nOvary —One of the two almond-shaped glands in\nthe female reproductive system responsible for pro-ducing eggs and the hormones estrogen and proges-terone.\nOvulation —The monthly release of an egg from the\novary.\nPituitary gland —The “master gland” at the base of\nthe brain that secretes a number of hormonesresponsible for growth, reproduction, and otheractivities. Pituitary hormones stimulate the ovariesto release estrogen and progesterone.\nProgesterone —The hormone that is produced by\nthe ovary after ovulation to prepare the uterine lin-ing for a fertilized egg.\nTestosterone —Male hormone produced by the\ntestes and (in small amounts) in the ovaries. Testos-terone is responsible for some masculine secondarysex characteristics such as growth of body hair anddeepening voice.\nUterus —The female reproductive organ that con-\ntains and nourishes a fetus from implantation untilbirth. Also known as the womb.\nVagina —The tube-like passage from the vulva (a\nwoman’s external genital structures) to the cervix (theportion of the uterus that projects into the vagina).\ndrugs mimic estrogen, protecting against heart disease\nand osteoporosis without putting a woman at risk forbreast cancer.\nLike estrogen, raloxifene works by attaching to an\nestrogen “receptor,” much like a key fits into a lock.When raloxifene clicks into the estrogen receptors in thebreast and uterus, it blocks estrogen at these sites. This isthe secret of its cancer-fighting property. Many tumors inthe breast are fueled by estrogen; if the estrogen cannotget in the cell, then the cancer stops growing.\nWomen may prefer to take raloxifene instead of hor-\nmone replacement because the new drug doesn’t boostthe breast cancer risk and doesn’t have side effects likeuterine bleeding, bloating, or breast soreness. Unfortu-nately, the drug may worsen hot flashes. Raloxifene isbasically a treatment to prevent osteoporosis. It doesn’thelp with common symptoms and it is unclear if it hasthe same protective effect against heart disease as estro-gen does.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2161MenopauseTestosterone replacement\nThe ovaries also produce a small amount of male\nhormones, which decreases slightly as a woman entersmenopause. The vast majority of women never needtestosterone replacement, but it can be important if awoman has declining interest in sex. Testosterone canimprove the libido, and decrease anxiety and depression;\nadding testosterone especially helps women who havehad hysterectomies. Testosterone also eases breast ten-derness and helps prevent bone loss. However, testos-terone does have side effects. Some women experiencemild acne and some facial hair growth, but because only\nsmall amounts of testosterone are prescribed, mostwomen don’t appear to have extreme masculine changes.\nBirth control pills\nWomen who are still having periods but who have\nannoying menopausal symptoms may take low-dosebirth control pills to ease the problems; this treatment hasbeen approved by the FDA for perimenopausal symp-toms in women under age 55. HRT is the preferred treat-ment for menopause, however, because it uses lowerdoses of estrogen.\nAlternative treatment\nSome women also report success in using natural\nremedies to treat the unpleasant symptoms of menopause.Not all women need estrogen and some women can’t takeit. Many doctors don’t want to give hormones to womenwho are still having their periods, however erratically.Indeed, only a third of menopausal women in the UnitedStates try HRT and of those who do, eventually half ofthem drop the therapy. Some are worried about breast can-cer, some can’t tolerate the side effects, some don’t wantto medicate what they consider to be a natural occurrence.\nHerbs\nHerbs have been used to relieve menopausal symp-\ntoms for centuries. In general, most herbs are consideredsafe, and there is no substantial evidence that herbalproducts are a major source of toxic reactions. Butbecause herbal products aren’t regulated in the UnitedStates, contamination or accidental overdose is possible.Herbs should be bought from a recognized company orthrough a qualified herbal practitioner.\nWomen who choose to take herbs for menopausal\nsymptoms should learn as much as possible about herbsand work with a qualified practitioner (an herbalist, a tra-ditional Chinese doctor, or a naturopathic physician).Pregnant women should avoid herbs because of unknowneffects on a developing fetus.The following list of herbs include those that herbal-\nists most often prescribe to treat menstrual complaints:\n• black cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa ): hot flashes and\nother menstrual complaints\n• black currant: breast tenderness\n• chaste tree/chasteberry ( Vitex agnus-castus ): hot flashes,\nexcessive menstrual bleeding, fibroids, and moodiness\n• evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis ): mood\nswings, irritability, and breast tenderness\n• fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare ): hot flashes, digestive gas,\nand bloating\n• flaxseed (linseed): excessive menstrual bleeding, breast\ntenderness, and other symptoms, including dry skin andvaginal dryness\n• gingko ( Gingko biloba ): memory problems\n• ginseng ( Panax ginseng ): hot flashes, fatigue and vagi-\nnal thinning.\n• hawthorn ( Crataegus laevigata ): memory problems,\nfuzzy thinking\n• lady’s mantle: excessive menstrual bleeding\n• mexican wild yam ( Dioscorea villosa ) root: vaginal\ndryness, hot flashes and general menopause symptoms\n• motherwort ( Leonurus cardiaca ): night sweats, hot\nflashes\n• oat ( Avena sativa ) straw : mood swings, anxiety\n• red clover ( Trifolium pratense ): hot flashes\n• sage ( Salvia officinalis ): mood swings, headaches,\nnight sweats\n• valerian ( Valeriana officinalis ): insomnia\nNatural estrogens (phytoestrogens)\nProponents of plant estrogens (including soy prod-\nucts) believe that plant estrogens are better than syntheticestrogen, but science has not yet proven this. The resultsof smaller preliminary trials suggest that the estrogencompounds in soy products can indeed relieve the severi-ty of hot flashes and lower cholesterol. But no one yethas proven that soy can provide all the benefits of syn-thetic estrogen without its negative effects.\nIt is true that people in other countries who eat foods\nhigh in plant estrogens (especially soy products) havelower rates of breast cancer and report fewer “symp-toms” of menopause. While up to 80% of menopausalwomen in the United States complain of hot flashes,night sweats, and vaginal dryness, only 15% of Japanesewomen have similar complaints. When all other thingsare equal, a soy-based diet may make a difference (andsoy is very high in plant estrogens).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2162MenopauseThe study of phytoestrogens is so new that there\naren’t very many recommendations on how much awoman can consume. Herbal practitioners recommend adose based on a woman’s history, body size, lifestyle,diet, and reported symptoms. Research has indicated thatsome women were able to ease their symptoms by eatinga large amount of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains,together with four ounces of tofu four times a week.\nWhat concerns some critics of other alternative\nremedies is that many women think that “natural” or“plant-based” means “harmless.” In large doses, phytoe-strogens can promote the abnormal growth of cells in theuterine lining. Unopposed estrogen of any type can leadto endometrial cancer, which is why women on conven-tional estrogen-replacement therapy usually take proges-terone (progestin) along with their estrogen. However, aplant-based progesterone product can sometimes beeffective alone, without estrogen, in assisting themenopausal woman in rebalancing her hormonal actionthroughout this transition time.\nYoga\nMany women find that yoga (the ancient medita-\ntion/exercise developed in India 5,000 years ago) canease menopausal symptoms. Yoga focuses on helpingwomen unite the mind, body, and spirit to create balance.Because yoga has been shown to balance the endocrinesystem, some experts believe it may affect hormone-related problems. Studies have found that yoga canreduce stress , improve mood, boost a sluggish metabo-\nlism, and slow the heart rate. Specific yoga positions dealwith particular problems, such as hot flashes, moodswings, vaginal and urinary problems, and other pains.\nExercise\nExercise helps ease hot flashes by lowering the\namount of circulating FSH and LH and by raising endor-phin levels that drop while having a hot flash. Even exer-cising 20 minutes three times a week can significantlyreduce hot flashes.\nElimination\nRegular, daily bowel movements to eliminate waste\nproducts from the body can be crucial in maintaining bal-ance through menopause. The bowels are where circulat-ing hormones are gathered and eliminated, keeping thebody from recycling them and causing an imbalance.\nAcupuncture\nThis ancient Asian art involves placing very thin\nneedles into different parts of the body to stimulate thesystem and unblock energy. It is usually painless and has\nbeen used for many menopausal symptoms, includinginsomnia, hot flashes, and irregular periods. Practitionersbelieve that acupuncture can facilitate the opening of\nblocked energy channels, allowing the life force energy(chi) to flow freely. This allows the menopausal womanto keep her energy moving. Blocked energy usuallyincreases the symptoms of menopause.\nAcupressure and massage\nTherapeutic massage involving acupressure can\nbring relief from a wide range of menopause symptomsby placing finger pressure at the same meridian points onthe body that are used in acupuncture. There are morethan 80 different types of massage, including foot reflex-\nology ,Shiatsu massage, or Swedish massage, but they\nare all based on the idea that boosting the circulation ofblood and lymph benefits health.\nBiofeedback\nSome women have been able to control hot flashes\nthrough biofeedback , a painless technique that helps a\nperson train her mind to control her body. A biofeedbackmachine provides information about body processes(such as heart rate) as the woman relaxes her body. Usingthis technique, it is possible to control the body’s temper-ature, heart rate, and breathing.\nPrognosis\nMenopause is a natural condition of aging. Some\nwomen have no problems at all with menopause, whileothers notice significant unpleasant symptoms. A widearray of treatments, from natural to hormone replace-ment, mean that no woman needs to suffer through thistime of her life.\nPrevention\nMenopause is a natural part of the aging process and\nnot a disease that needs to be prevented. Most doctorsrecommend HRT for almost all post-menopausalwomen, usually for a few years. When HRT is thenstopped, symptoms should be mild or non existent. ButHRT is not only useful in lessening the symptoms ofmenopause; it also protects against heart disease andosteoporosis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie Eisenstat, and Terra Ziporyn.

The reasons for this discrepan-cy are not completely understood. Men may have somegenetic predisposition for lower life expectancy, aswomen tend to outlive men in most areas throughout theworld. But men also have different lifestyle patterns thatincrease the wear and tear on their bodies. Studies haveshown that men tend to drink and smoke more thanwomen, men obtain medical care less frequently thanwomen, and men generally have more stressful habits. Itis clear to health professionals that men can benefit fromincreased knowledge of male medical issues and byunderstanding how lifestyle choices impact health.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC),\nthe 10 leading causes of death for men in the United\nStates are:\n• heart disease•cancer\n•stroke\n• accidents\n• lung disease (including emphysema and chronic bron-\nchitis)\n• pneumonia• diabetes• suicide\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2164Men’s health• liver disease\n• homicides\nMen also suffer regularly from conditions as diverse\nas sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), mental illness,\narthritis, urinary tract infections, athletic injuries, hairand skin problems, and digestive disorders. The field ofmen’s health strives to reduce the risks and incidence ofmen’s conditions by researching preventative practices,designing testing procedures for early detection, and rec-ommending specialized courses of treatment.\nDescription\nPrevention\nPreventative practices for men’s health emphasize\ndiet, exercise and stress management, as well as the elim-\nination of risky behaviors like smoking and excessive\ndrinking. Four of the leading causes of death for Ameri-can men are related to diet—heart disease, cancer, stroke,and diabetes. In addition men are more likely than womento suffer from diet-related conditions including high cho-\nlesterol , high blood pressure, and obesity , all of which\nincrease the risk of certain diseases and premature death.\nFor American men, dietary problems are usually not\nthe result of getting too little nourishment but of eatingtoo much fat, sugar, and overall calories. The dietarychange most likely to improve the health of males isreduced intake of fats, particularly cholesterol and satu-rated fats. Cholesterol and saturated fats are found main-ly in meat and dairy products. Calories from fat shouldamount to no more than 30% of total daily calories. Eat-ing adequate protein is generally not a problem forAmerican men, so replacing some dairy and meat con-sumption with high fiber vegetable proteins such asbeans and soy would be beneficial. Complex carbohy-drates should provide the bulk of daily calories, such asthose from whole grains and legumes, while sugar intakeshould be significantly reduced, such as in soft drinks,desserts and processed foods. Increasing dietary fiber isrecommended by eating plenty of fresh fruits, vegeta-bles, whole grains and legumes. Other principles of ahealthy diet are avoiding artificial and processed foods,eating food that is as fresh and natural as possible, drink-ing plenty of water, and avoiding hydrogenated or par-tially hydrogenated oils, which contain unhealthy sub-stances called trans-fatty acids. Overeating should beavoided as should snacking between meals, and alcoholintake should be limited to one or two glasses per day.\nExercise\nThe health of men has been affected as work pat-\nterns have shifted. Physical labor has been replaced bymachines and office work. Studies have estimated that\nover 30% of Americans are now obese, which means thatnearly one out of three people is significantly over-weight. Obesity poses many risks including increasingthe chances of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.Effective exercise programs help men control weight,reduce stress, increase energy levels, improve self-esteem, reduce pain and injuries, and improve sleep.\nExercise programs should emphasize flexibility andstretching as well as plenty of aerobic activities, such asrunning and swimming that exercise the heart and lungsand burn excess calories. Men may also choose anaero-bic activities such as weight training to add muscles andincrease strength. Routines should begin with warm-upsto reduce the chances of injuries and end with cool-downexercises to speed recovery.\nStress reduction\nStress is a silent killer; chronic (long-term) stress is\na risk factor in many of the major diseases affectingmen’s mortality rates. Prolonged stress may also causeulcers, sleep disorders , addictions, depression, anxiety ,\nand other conditions. Reduction of stress may requirechanges in both activities and attitudes. Exercise is rec-ommended, as is reducing dependence on alcohol andnicotine. Men with extreme job-related stress maychoose to spend more time with their families or inenjoyable activities. Men with stress levels that lead todestructive behaviors may need to pursue psychotherapyor significant lifestyle changes. Nutrition , social sup-\nport, and healthy sleep patterns also reduce stress.\nAlternative therapies may help with stress reduc-\ntion. Their use has been adopted by many leading health\ncenters. Biofeedback utilizes machines that monitor\nuser’s stress levels, so people can learn to control stresslevels. Meditation and other mind/body techniques are\ntaught to enable the relaxation response, which has theopposite effects of stress in the body.\nTesting\nRoutine physical examinations performed by physi-\ncians are recommended every three years for men in theirtwenties and thirties, every two years for men in their for-ties, and every year for men over 50. Physicians mayorder several screening tests as well, depending on theage and condition of the patient. Blood tests screen fordiabetes, high cholesterol, cancer, infections, and HIV .The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a blood screenfor prostate cancer . The digital rectal exam is used to\nmanually check the prostate gland for enlargement orirregularities. Urine tests check for infections, kidneyproblems, and diabetes. The fecal occult blood test\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2165Men’s healthexamines the stool for indications of ulcers or cancer. A\nsigmoidoscopy checks the health of the rectum and lower\ncolon. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) check the status of theheart. Older men may consult an opthalmologist (eye spe-cialist) every two years for vision and glaucoma testing.\nMen may perform self-tests as preventative mea-\nsures. During a skin cancer self-exam, the entire skin ischecked closely for irregular or changing moles , lesions,\nor blemishes, usually red, white or blue in color. Abnor-mal findings should be reported to a physician. Likesome forms of skin cancer, testicular cancer tends to\nspread rapidly and early detection is crucial. The testicu-lar self-exam is best performed in the shower or bath,because warm water relaxes the scrotum. The testiclesare gently rolled and massaged between the fingers andthumb to feel for bumps, swelling, tenderness, or irregu-larities. Some self-test kits are available in pharmacies,including ones for blood pressure, high cholesterol, col-orectal cancer, and blood glucose tests for diabetes.These do not take the place of proper medical care, andphysicians should be consulted before their use.\nHeart disease\nHeart disease is the major cause of death among\nmen. It claims nearly half a million lives every year inthe United States and is more likely in men than women.Heart disease can take several forms but the most preva-lent is coronary heart disease, in which the blood vesselsthat supply the heart with oxygen become blocked andthe heart muscle becomes increasingly stressed. Arte-riosclerosis, a major factor, is the hardening of arteriesdue to the accumulation of fats and other substances.Hypertension , or high blood pressure also poses major\nrisks for both heart disease and stroke. Angina pectoris\nis the chest pain associated with the early stages of heartdisease; over three million American men suffer from it.When the blockage of blood supply to the heart becomessevere, a myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) may\noccur, which can be fatal.\nThe main symptom of angina pectoris is sharp pain\non the left side of the chest that may radiate throughoutthe upper body. Other symptoms include shortness of\nbreath ,dizziness ,fatigue , and swelling in the legs and\nankles. Angina may be triggered by physical or emotion-al stress and lasts up to 30 minutes. Heart attacks havesimilar symptoms but with longer and more intense painin the chest and upper body and may be accompanied bycold sweats and vomiting.\nThe American Heart Association lists the main risk\nfactors for heart disease as being male, old age, havingfamily history of the disease, smoking, high cholesterol,high blood pressure, diabetes, alcoholism , obesity, phys-ical inactivity and stress. Clearly, lifestyle habits such as\ndiet, exercise and stress control play major roles in thedevelopment and prevention of heart disease in men.\nCancer\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that\nover 1.2 million cases of cancer were reported in 2000.Men have a slightly higher risk for cancer than women.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates thatthe number of cancer cases in most countries will doublein the next 25 years, while men’s prostate cancer isexpected to go up 40% worldwide. The most commoncancers in men are skin, prostate, lung, colorectal (colonand rectum), lymphoma (lymph glands), oral (mouth andthroat), and testicular cancer. The ACS lists seven warn-ing signs of cancer:\n• unusual bleeding or discharge• changes in bowel or bladder patterns• persistent sores• lumps or irregularities on the body• difficulty swallowing or indigestion• changes in warts or moles\n• persistent cough or hoarseness in the throat\nAlthough the causes of cancer are incompletely\nunderstood, there are several risk factors that increase itschances: family history of cancer, smoking, poor diet(high in fat, low in fiber), excessive alcohol consump-tion, skin damage from sunlight, and exposure to radia-tion, chemicals, and environmental pollutants.\nThe prostate gland is a walnut-sized organ in the\nmale reproductive system, located near the rectum belowthe bladder. The ACS reported that there were nearly185,000 new cases of prostate cancer in 1998, causing40,000 deaths, making prostate cancer the second mostfatal cancer for men behind lung cancer. Worldwide stud-ies have shown that about 12% of men in Western coun-tries get prostate cancer, while 50% have enlargedprostates. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is theenlargement of the prostate gland, called benign when itis non-cancerous although growth can be rapid.\nWith early detection, 98% of men with prostate can-\ncer survive for five years. Many cases of prostate cancergrow so slowly that they don’t require treatment. Symp-toms of prostate cancer include difficulty in stopping orstarting urination, frequent nighttime urination (noc-turia), weak urine flow, and blood in the urine or semen.\nTesticular cancer is most common in men between\nthe ages of 15 and 34. The ACS estimated that there were7,600 cases of testicular cancer in 1998.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2166Men’s healthStroke\nStrokes occur when the blood supply to the brain is\ninterrupted and brain function becomes impaired due tolack of oxygen. Ischemic strokes occur due to blood ves-sels becoming blocked while hemorrhagic strokes are theresult of broken blood vessels in or near the brain.Ischemic strokes account for about 80% of all strokes.The American Heart Association estimates that over600,000 Americans suffer from strokes each year, withmen having a 20% higher risk of stroke than women,although more women die from strokes. Other risk fac-tors are hypertension (high blood pressure), previousheart attacks, age, family history, high cholesterol, smok-ing, obesity, alcoholism, and physical inactivity. African-Americans have 60 percent greater chances for strokesthan whites.\nSymptoms of stroke include sudden weakness or\nnumbness, blurring or loss of vision, difficulty speakingor understanding, sudden severe headache , and dizzi-\nness or falling. Stroke victims should receive immediateemergency care.\nMale urinary tract problems\nThe urinary system includes the kidneys and blad-\nder, the ureters between the kidneys and bladder, and theurethra, the tube through which urine flows from thebladder. Symptoms of urinary tract problems include fre-quent urination, excessive urination at night, painful orburning urination, weak urination, blood in the urine, orincontinence (involuntary loss of urine). Urethritis is\ninfection of the urethra, which is a major symptom ofsexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Kidney stones\n(nephrolithiasis) are the most common urinary tractproblems, accounting for nearly one out of every 100hospital admissions in the United States. Eighty percentof kidney stone patients are men. About 12% of Ameri-can men will develop kidney stones during their life-times. Kidney stones cause extreme pain when theymove from the kidneys into the ureters. Ten percent ofkidney stone cases require surgery. The best preventionfor kidney stones is drinking plenty of fluids daily.\nThe male reproductive system\nThe male reproductive system includes the penis,\ntesticles, scrotum, prostate and other organs. Problemsinclude orchitis , or infection of the testicles, and hydro-\ncele, the buildup of fluid on the testicles. Epididymitis is\ninflammation of the tube that transports sperm from thetesticles, and can cause severe pain, swelling, and fever .\nA varicocele is a group of varicose veins in the scrotum\nthat can cause swelling and damage sperm. Peyronie’s\ndisease is the abnormal curvature of the penis caused byaccumulated scar tissue. Testicular torsion is considered\na medical emergency, when a testicle becomes twistedand blood supply is cut off. This condition can lead topermanent damage if not treated quickly. It is most com-mon in males between the ages of 12 and 18. Prostatitis\nis infection or inflammation of the prostate gland.\nSexually transmitted diseases include genital warts ,\nchlamydia, gonorrhea ,syphilis ,genital herpes , hepati-\ntis and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). HIV is\nthe leading cause for death for American men betweenthe ages of 25 and 45. Symptoms of STDs include dis-charge of fluid from the penis; painful urination; sores,lesions, itching , or rashes in the genital area; and\nswelling of the lymph nodes in the groin. Prevention ofSTDs begins with safe sexual behavior: wearing con-doms, limiting the number of sexual partners, not mixingsexual encounters with alcohol, and avoiding sexual con-tact with infected people, prostitutes and intravenousdrug users. Men who engage in risky behaviors shouldhave frequent HIV tests and medical examinations.\nMale sexual health\nErectile dysfunction (ED), also called impotence ,i s\na man’s inability to maintain an erection for sexual inter-course. It is estimated that half of all men over 40 experi-ence ED occasionally and 20 million American men arechronic sufferers, particularly older men as ED increaseswith age. Up to 80% of ED is caused by physical prob-lems, while 20% of cases are psychogenic, or psycholog-ical in origin. Causes of ED include hormonal problems,injuries, nerve damage, diseases, infections, diabetes,stress, depression, anxiety, drug abuse and interactionswith prescription drugs.\nA self-test men can perform to determine whether\nED is physical or psychological is the stamp test, or noc-turnal penile tumescence test. Physically healthy menexperience several prolonged erections during sleep. Thestamp test is done by attaching a strip of stamps aroundthe penis before bedtime; if the stamps are torn in themorning, it generally indicates that nocturnal (nightly)erections have occurred and thus ED is not physiological.Men with ED should see urologists for further diagnosisand discussion of the several treatment options availableincluding drugs, hormone injections and surgical repairor implants.\nInfertility occurs when men lack an adequate sup-\nply of sperm to cause pregnancy . As many as 15% of\nAmerican couples are affected by infertility in one orboth partners, or over five million Americans. A WorldHealth Organization (WHO) project found that in about20% of infertile couples, the problem was due to theman, while in another 27% of couples both partners had\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2167Men’s healthinfertility problems. Injuries, birth defects , infections,\nenvironmental pollutants, chronic stress, drug abuse andhormonal problems may account for male infertility,while one in four cases has no apparent cause and istermed idiopathic infertility. Declining sperm countshave been observed in industrialized countries, and pos-sible explanations for this decrease are as diverse asincreased environmental pollutants to the use of plasticdiapers, which a German study claims damages infanttesticles by keeping in excess heat. Male infertility canbe diagnosed by sperm analysis, blood tests, radiograph-ic scans of the testicles and other tests.\nOther types of sexual dysfunction include prema-\nture ejaculation , in which men cannot sustain inter-\ncourse long enough to bring their partners to climax, andretarded ejaculation (also called male orgasmic disorder)when male orgasm becomes difficult. Some men haveperiods of inadequate sexual desire (hypoactive sexualdesire disorder), while sexual aversion disorder (SAD) isfear and repulsion of sexual activity. Dyspareunia ispainful intercourse, and should be reported to physiciansas it may indicate STDs or infections. In addition to med-ical care, sexual dysfunction may be treated by sex ther-\napyor psychotherapy depending on its causes.\nVasectomies, a form of male birth control, are surgi-\ncal operations that sever the tubes that transport spermfrom the testicles. Vasectomies can be reversed but tenpercent of men become infertile due to the surgery. Cir-\ncumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the\npenis, for religious and medical reasons, performed on60% of newborn males in the United States. Increasingcontroversy surrounds this procedure. Advocates of cir-cumcision claim it prevents infections (called balanitis )\non the head of the penis and reduces chances of penile\ncancer . Opponents of circumcision claim that the outdat-\ned procedure affords no medical benefits, that it causesunnecessary pain for infants, and that the lack of a fore-skin may reduce sexual pleasure and performance.KEY TERMS\nEmphysema —Disease of severe lung deterioration\nand impairment.\nObesity —Condition defined as being overweight\nby 30 percent of normal limits.\nSigmoidoscopy —Test procedure using an optical\ninstrument to view the internal rectum and colon.\nUrologist —Physician specializing in male repro-\nductive and urinary systems.Men’s emotional health\nDepression is a mood disorder marked by sadness,\nemotional pain, and the inability to feel pleasure. At least10% of men will experience an episode of major depres-sion at least once in their lives. Men with depression arefive times more likely to commit suicide, a major causeof mortality in men. Men are half as likely to seek psy-chological help than women. Men may suffer depressionand emotional problems between the ages of 50 and 65,called the midlife crisis as men face the major transitioninto retirement and older age.\nPanic attacks have symptoms of overwhelming\nfear, chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness, andincreased heart rate. Men may mistake them as heartattacks. Men are also plagued by addictions to nico-tine, alcohol, and other drugs, which are often theunhealthy escape routes from deeper emotional issues.Studies have estimated that as many as one third ofAmericans have suffered from sleep disorders, whichmay be psychological in origin and related to anxiety,stress and lifestyle.\nMental illness can be particularly difficult for men\nbecause in our society men are taught to withhold ratherthan express emotions and feelings. Emotional problemscan be strong signals for men to communicate and con-front deeper issues. Help can be found from physicians,psychotherapists, and spiritual or religious counselors.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBauman, Alisa, Brian Kaufman, and Men’s Health Books, eds.\nSymptom Solver: Understanding and Treating the MostCommon Male Health Concerns.

But numerous things can wrong\nwith the normal menstrual cycle, some the result of physi-cal causes, others emotional. These include amenorrhea ,\nor the cessation of menstruation, menorrhagia, or heavybleeding, and dysmenorrhea , or severe menstrual\ncramps. Nearly every woman will experience one or moreof these menstrual irregularities at some time in her life.\nAmenorrhea\nThere are two types of amenorrhea: primary and sec-\nondary. Overall, they affect 2 to 5 percent of childbearingwomen, a number that is considerably higher amongfemale athletes (possibly as high as 66 percent).\nPrimary amenorrhea occurs when a girl of at least 16\nis not menstruating. Young girls may not have regularperiods for their first year or two, or their periods may bevery light, a condition known as oligomenorrhea . This\nis nothing to worry about. But if the period hasn’t begunat all by age 16, there may be something wrong. It’s mostcommon in girls who are severely underweight and/orexercise intensely, both of which affect the amount of\nbody fat necessary to trigger the release of hormonesthat, in turn, begins puberty .\nSecondary amenorrhea occurs in women of child-\nbearing age after a period of normal menstruation and isdiagnosed when menstruation has stopped for threemonths. It can occur in women of any age.\nDysmenorrhea\nCharacterized by menstrual cramps or painful peri-\nods, dysmenorrhea, which is Greek for “painful menstru-ation,” affects nearly every woman at some point in herlife. It’s the most common reproductive problem inwomen, resulting in numerous days absent from school,work and other activities. There are two types: primaryand secondary.\nPrimary, or normal cramps, affects up to 90 percent\nof all women, usually occurring in women about threeyears after they start menstruating and continuingthrough their mid-twenties or until they have a child.About 10 percent of women who have this type of dys-menorrhea can’t work, attend school, or participate intheir normal activities. It may be accompanied by back-ache, dizziness ,headache , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea\nand tenseness. The symptoms typically start a day or twobefore menstruation, usually ending when menstruationactually begins.\nSecondary dysmenorrhea has an underlying physical\ncause and primarily affects older women, although itmay also occur immediately after a woman begins men-struation, however.\nMenorrhagia\nMenorrhagia, or heavy bleeding, most commonly\noccurs in the years just before menopause or just afterwomen start menstruating. It occurs in 9 to 14 percent ofall women.\nCauses and symptoms\nAmenorrhea\nThe only symptom of primary amenorrhea is\ndelayed menstruation. In addition to low body weight orexcessive exercise, other causes of primary amenorrheainclude Turner’s Syndrome, a birth defect related to thereproductive system, or ovarian problems. In secondaryamenorrhea, the primary symptom is the ceasing of men-struation for at least three months. Causes include preg-\nnancy or breastfeeding, sudden weight loss or gain,\nintense exercise, stress , endocrine disorders affecting the\nthyroid, pituitary or adrenal glands, including Cushing’s\nSyndrome and hyperthyroidism , problems with or\nsurgery on the ovaries, including removal of the ovaries,cysts or ovarian tumors.\nDysmenorrhea\nPrimary dysmenorrhea is related to the production of\nprostaglandins, natural chemicals the body makes thatcause an inflammatory reaction. They also cause the mus-cles of the uterus to contract, thus helping the uterus shedthe lining built up during the first part of a woman’s cycle.Women with severe menstrual pain have higher levels ofprostaglandin in their menstrual blood than women whodon’t have such pain. In some women, prostaglandins cancause some of the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinaltract to contract, resulting in the nausea, vomiting anddiarrhea some women experience. Prostaglandins alsocause the arteries and veins to expand, so that blood col-lects in them rather than flowing freely through them,causing pain and heaviness. Yet another reason for severecramps, particularly in women who haven’t yet had ababy, is that the flow of the blood and clots through the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2169Menstrual disorderstiny cervical opening is painful. After a woman has a\nbaby, however, the cervix opening is larger.\nSecondary dysmenorrhea is more serious and is\nrelated to some underlying cause. The pain may feel likeregular menstrual cramps, but may last longer than nor-mal and occur throughout the month. It may be strongeron one side than the other. Possible causes include:\n• a tipped uterus\n• endometriosis, in which the lining of the uterus grows\noutside the uterus\n• adenomyosis, in which the endometrial lining grows\ninto the muscle of the uterus\n• fibroids\n•pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n• an IUD\n• a uterine, ovarian, bowel or bladder tumor• uterine polyps\n• inflammatory bowel disease\n• scarring or adhesions from earlier surgery\nMenorrhagia\nHeavy bleeding during menstruation is usually relat-\ned to a hormonal imbalance, although other causesinclude fibroids, cervical or endometrial polyps, theautoimmune disease lupus, pelvic inflammatory disease(PID), blood platelet disorder, or, possibly, some repro-ductive cancers. Thus, menorrhagia is actually a symp-tom of an underlying condition rather than a diseaseitself. It may also be related to the use of an IUD.\nWomen with menorrhagia experience not only sig-\nnificant inconvenience, including basically being trappedin their homes during the first day or two of their periods,but may feel very tired due to the loss of iron-rich blood.It is usually diagnosed when a woman soaks through atampon or pad every hour for several hours or has a peri-od lasting more than 7 days. Clots are not related to men-orrhagia, although women with heavy cycles may passclots. They are typically a normal part of menstruation,more common when a woman has been sitting or in a sta-tionary position for a while\nDiagnosis\nWomen should seek care from a gynecologist, family\npractitioner or internist for menstrual irregularities.Depending on the problem, various tests and procedureswill be performed, but the one common to any menstrualproblem is a pelvic exam . This should be scheduled when\nwomen are not menstruating, simply for convenience sake.Male doctors typically have a female nurse or assis-\ntant in the room. The exam begins by checking the exter-nal genitalia for any sores or irregularities. Then the doc-tor inserts a speculum (a metal duckbill-shaped devicethat holds open the vagina) into the vagina and peersthroughout the opening to evaluate the health of thecervix (opening of the uterus), and inside the vagina,looking for growths or any other abnormalities.\nThe doctor will also manually examine the woman,\ninserting two fingers into the vagina while pressing onthe abdomen, again feeling for any lumps or other abnor-malities, checking the size and shape of the reproductiveorgans, and watching for any signs of infection, such astenderness or pain. The exam is typically covered byinsurance and takes about 10 minutes.\nOther tests that will be done for menstrual irregulari-\nties include:\n• A pregnancy test. The nurse takes some blood from a\nwoman’s arm and it is tested for the presence of certainhormones that indicate a pregnancy has occurred.\n• Ultrasound. Typically performed by a trained ultra-\nsound technician, it involves using sound waves to getan image of the reproductive system. It is used to lookfor fibroids and other ovarian abnormalities that maycause heavy bleeding or cramps. Typically, the techni-cian will smear a jelly over the woman’s stomach, thenplace a probe on her stomach and watch the imagesappear on a computer screen. It is painless. Womenmay be asked not to urinate for several hours prior tothe test, as a full bladder makes it easier to see the otherinternal organs. The test takes about 20 minutes.\n• Endometrial biopsy. Used to check the health of uterine\ntissue in women who have unusually heavy bleeding, thistest should be performed by the physician. Women shouldtake a pain reliever like Motrin or Aleve prior to the pro-cedure, as there may be some cramping. The woman liesback on the table with her feet in stirrups and the doctorinserts a speculum, then opens the cervix slightly with aninstrument called a tenaculum. Then the doctor slides asmall, hollow catheter into the uterus and sucks a smallpiece of tissue from the uterine lining out. The tissue isthen examined for any abnormalities in a laboratory. Thetest takes about 30 minutes and is typically covered byinsurance. Some bleeding may result afterwards.\n• Blood, stool and urine tests may also be conducted to\ncheck for levels of various hormones, blood cells, andother chemicals.\n• Dilation and curettage (D&C): During this minor surgi-\ncal procedure, the cervix is opened and the lining of theuterus scraped for a tissue sample.\n• Laparascopy and hysteroscopy : in some instances,\nthese surgical procedures, in which a small camera is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2170Menstrual disordersinserted into the woman to view the inside of the pelvis,\nabdomen or uterus.\nTreatment\nAmenorrhea\nFor primary amenorrhea with no underlying problem,\nno treatment is necessary, and a wait-and-see approach isoften adopted. If women have genetic or hormonal abnor-malities, amenorrhea is often treated with oral contracep-\ntives that contain combinations of estrogen and progestin.\nSide effects include bloating, weight gain and acne ,\nalthough some birth control pills actually improve acne.Progestins, or synthetic progesterone, are also used aloneto “jump start” a woman’s period. They include medrox-yprogesterone (Provera, Amen, Depo-Provera), norethin-drone acetate (Aygestin, Norlutate), and norgestrel(Ovrel).If the amenorrhea is due to a physical problem,such as a closed vagina, surgery may be required.\nWith secondary amenorrhea, treatment depends on\nthe cause. Hormonal imbalances are treated with supple-mental hormones. Tumors or cysts may require surgery,obesity may require a diet and exercise regimen, while\namenorrhea resulting from too much dieting or exercisenecessitates lifestyle changes.\nDysmenorrhea\nPrimary dysmenorrhea is typically treated with non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofenKEY TERMS\nAdenomyosis —Uterine thickening caused when\nendometrial tissue, which normally lines the uterus,extends outward into the fibrous and muscular tis-sue of the uterus.\nCervical polyps —Growths originating from the sur-\nface of the cervix or endocervical canal. Thesesmall, fragile growths hang from a stalk and pro-trude through the cervical opening (the os).\nCushing’s Syndrome —A group of conditions\ncaused by increased production of cortisol hor-mones or by the administration of glucocorticoidhormones (cortisone-like hormones).\nEndometriosis —A condition in which the tissue that\nnormally lines the uterus (endometrium) grows inother areas of the body, causing pain, irregularbleeding, and frequently, infertility.\nFibroids —Benign tumors of muscle and connectivetissue that develop within or are attached to the\nuterine wall.\nHyperthyroidism —An imbalance in metabolism that\noccurs from overproduction of thyroid hormone.\nInflammatory bowel disease —A chronic inflamma-\ntory disease that can affect any part of the gastroin-testinal tract but most commonly affects the ileium.\nLupus —A chronic inflammatory autoimmune disor-\nder that may affect many organ systems includingthe skin, joints, and internal organs.\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) —A general term\nreferring to infection involving the lining of theuterus, the Fallopian tubes, or the ovaries.\nTurner’s Syndrome —A disorder in women caused\nby an inherited chromosomal defect. This disorderinhibits sexual development and causes infertility. Asymptom is absence of menstruation.\nand naproxen, which studies show help 64 to 100 per-\ncent of women. Birth control pills relieve pain andsymptoms in about 90 percent of women by suppressingovulation and reducing the amount of menstrual blood.It may take up to three cycles before a woman feelsrelief. Heat, whether a heating pad or hot bath, can alsohelp relieve pain.\nTreatment for secondary dysmenorrhea depends on\nthe underlying cause of the condition.\nMenorrhagia\nIf there are no other problems, and the bleeding is\ndue to hormonal imbalances, birth control pills areoften prescribed to bring the bleeding under control andregulate menstruation. Medications, such as ibuprofenand naproxen, can also help reduce the bleeding andany cramping associated with it. In severe cases, doc-tors may recommend removing the uterus during a hys-\nterectomy , or performing some form of endometrial\nablation, which removes the lining of the uterus. Theseare typically only offered to women who are finishedhaving children.\nAlternative treatment\nAmenorrhea\nThere are several herbal remedies that can bring on\nmenstruation, including: black cohosh, cramp bark,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2171Menstrual disorderschasteberry, celery, turmeric, and marsh mallow. Numer-\nous relaxation techniques, such as meditation , deep\nbreathing, and yoga can help reduce stress and its affects\non menstruation.\nDysmenorrhea\nNumerous alternative treatments may help relieve\nthe menstrual pain. These include:\n• Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS),\nwhich several studies found, relieved pain in 42 to 60percent of participants, working faster than naproxen inone study.\n•Acupuncture : One study of 43 patients followed for a\nyear found that 90 percent of those who had acupunc-ture once a week for three menstrual cycles had lesspain, and 43 percent used less pain medication.\n• Omega-3 fatty acids: Often sold as fish oil supple-\nments, they are a known anti-inflammatory, workingagainst the effects of prostaglandins. Studies found thatwomen with low amounts of omega-3 fatty acids intheir diets were more likely to have menstrual carmps;\nthose who took supplements had less pain.\n• Vitamin B-1: One large study found that symptoms dis-\nappeared in 87 percent of women who took 100 mg aday for 90 days.\n• Magnesium supplements: One study of 30 women who\ntook 4.5 milligrams of oral magnesium three timesdaily for part of the month decreased their symptomsup to 84 percent.\nMenorrhagia\nHerbs used to treat menorrhagia include yarrow, net-\ntles and shepherd’s purse, as well as agrimony, particu-larly used in Chinese medicine, ladies mantle, vervainand red raspberry, which are thought to strengthen theuterus. Vitex is another herb recommended for a varietyof menstrual disorders ranging from menorrhagia toPMS. Women may want to make sure they’re taking aniron supplement to replace the iron lost during the heavybleeding, although they should check with their doctor tomake sure they don’t suffer from a condition of havingtoo much iron. Helpful vitamins include vitamin A,\nbecause women with heavy bleeding typically havelower levels of Vitamin A, K, which aids in clotting, andC and bioflavinoids which help strengthen veins and cap-illaries. Zinc may also help.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for all menstrual irregularities is good\nonce treatment is initiated.Prevention\nAmenorrhea\nSimply following a healthy exercise and nutritional\nprogram can help prevent amenorrhia, as can reducingstress and learning relaxation techniques. Also, avoidingexcessive alcohol intake and quitting smoking may pre-\nvent missed periods.\nDysmenorrhea\nPrevention includes certain dietary supplements and\nvitamins described above. Exercise may also help.\nMenorrhagia\nThere’s little women can do to prevent this menstru-\nal irregularity other than discovering the root cause. Onething they can do, however, is stop using an IUD, whichcan often cause heavier bleeding.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDan , Alice J. (Editor), Linda L.

    "title": "Mental retardation",
    "content": "Mental retardation\nDefinition\nMental retardation is a developmental disability that\nfirst appears in children under the age of 18. It is defined\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2172Mental retardationas an intellectual functioning level (as measured by stan-\ndard tests for intelligence quotient) that is well belowaverage and significant limitations in daily living skills(adaptive functioning).\nDescription\nMental retardation occurs in 2.5-3% of the general\npopulation. About 6-7.5 million mentally retarded indi-viduals live in the United States alone. Mental retarda-tion begins in childhood or adolescence before the age of18. In most cases, it persists throughout adulthood. Adiagnosis of mental retardation is made if an individualhas an intellectual functioning level well below averageand significant limitations in two or more adaptive skillareas. Intellectual functioning level is defined by stan-dardized tests that measure the ability to reason in termsof mental age (intelligence quotient or IQ). Mental retar-dation is defined as IQ score below 70-75. Adaptiveskills are the skills needed for daily life. Such skillsinclude the ability to produce and understand language(communication); home-living skills; use of communityresources; health, safety, leisure, self-care, and socialskills; self-direction; functional academic skills (reading,writing, and arithmetic); and work skills.\nIn general, mentally retarded children reach devel-\nopmental milestones such as walking and talking muchlater than the general population. Symptoms of mentalretardation may appear at birth or later in childhood.Time of onset depends on the suspected cause of the dis-ability. Some cases of mild mental retardation are notdiagnosed before the child enters preschool. These chil-dren typically have difficulties with social, communica-tion, and functional academic skills. Children who have aneurological disorder or illness such as encephalitis or\nmeningitis may suddenly show signs of cognitive\nimpairment and adaptive difficulties.\nMental retardation varies in severity. The Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edi-\ntion ( DSM-IV ) is the diagnostic standard for mental\nhealthcare professionals in the United States. The DSM-\nIVclassifies four different degrees of mental retardation:\nmild, moderate, severe , and profound . These categories\nare based on the functioning level of the individual.\nMild mental retardation\nApproximately 85% of the mentally retarded popu-\nlation is in the mildly retarded category. Their IQ scoreranges from 50-75, and they can often acquire academicskills up to the 6th grade level. They can become fairlyself-sufficient and in some cases live independently, withcommunity and social support.Moderate mental retardation\nAbout 10% of the mentally retarded population is\nconsidered moderately retarded. Moderately retardedindividuals have IQ scores ranging from 35-55. They cancarry out work and self-care tasks with moderate super-vision. They typically acquire communication skills inchildhood and are able to live and function successfullywithin the community in a supervised environment suchas a group home.\nSevere mental retardation\nAbout 3-4% of the mentally retarded population is\nseverely retarded. Severely retarded individuals have IQscores of 20-40. They may master very basic self-careskills and some communication skills. Many severelyretarded individuals are able to live in a group home.\nProfound mental retardation\nOnly 1-2% of the mentally retarded population is\nclassified as profoundly retarded. Profoundly retardedindividuals have IQ scores under 20-25. They may beable to develop basic self-care and communication skillswith appropriate support and training. Their retardationis often caused by an accompanying neurological disor-der. The profoundly retarded need a high level of struc-ture and supervision.\nThe American Association on Mental Retardation\n(AAMR) has developed another widely accepted diagnos-tic classification system for mental retardation. TheAAMR classification system focuses on the capabilities ofthe retarded individual rather than on the limitations. Thecategories describe the level of support required. They are:intermittent support, limited support, extensive support ,\nand pervasive support . To some extent, the AAMR classi-\nfication mirrors the DSM-IV classification. Intermittent\nsupport, for example, is support needed only occasionally,perhaps during times of stress or crisis. It is the type of\nsupport typically required for most mildly retarded indi-viduals. At the other end of the spectrum, pervasive sup-port, or life-long, daily support for most adaptive areas,would be required for profoundly retarded individuals.\nCauses and symptoms\nLow IQ scores and limitations in adaptive skills are\nthe hallmarks of mental retardation. Aggression, self-injury, and mood disorders are sometimes associated\nwith the disability. The severity of the symptoms and theage at which they first appear depend on the cause. Chil-dren who are mentally retarded reach developmentalmilestones significantly later than expected, if at all. Ifretardation is caused by chromosomal or other genetic\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2173Mental retardationdisorders, it is often apparent from infancy. If retardation\nis caused by childhood illnesses or injuries, learning andadaptive skills that were once easy may suddenlybecome difficult or impossible to master.\nIn about 35% of cases, the cause of mental retarda-\ntion cannot be found. Biological and environmental fac-tors that can cause mental retardation include:\nGenetics\nAbout 5% of mental retardation is caused by heredi-\ntary factors. Mental retardation may be caused by aninherited abnormality of the genes, such as fragile X syn-\ndrome . Fragile X, a defect in the chromosome that deter-\nmines sex, is the most common inherited cause of mentalretardation. Single gene defects such as phenylketonuria\n(PKU) and other inborn errors of metabolism may alsocause mental retardation if they are not found and treatedearly. An accident or mutation in genetic developmentmay also cause retardation. Examples of such accidentsKEY TERMS\nAmniocentesis —A test usually done between 16\nand 20 weeks of pregnancy to detect any abnormal-ities in the development of the fetus. A smallamount of the fluid surrounding the fetus (amnioticfluid) is drawn out through a needle inserted intothe mother’s womb. Laboratory analysis of this fluidcan detect various genetic defects, such as Downsyndrome, or neural tube defects.\nDevelopmental delay —The failure to meet certain\ndevelopmental milestones, such as sitting, walking,and talking, at the average age. Developmentaldelay may indicate a problem in development ofthe central nervous system.\nDown syndrome —A disorder caused by an abnor-\nmality at the 21st chromosome. One symptom ofDown syndrome is mental retardation.\nExtensive support —Ongoing daily support required\nto assist an individual in a specific adaptive area,such as daily help with preparing meals.\nHib disease —An infection caused by Haemophilus\ninfluenza type b (Hib). This disease mainly affects chil-\ndren under the age of five. In that age group, it is theleading cause of bacterial meningitis, pneumonia,joint and bone infections, and throat inflammations.\nInborn error of metabolism —A rare enzyme defi-\nciency; children with inborn errors of metabolismdo not have certain enzymes that the body requires\nto maintain organ functions. Inborn errors of metab-olism can cause brain damage and mental retarda-tion if left untreated. Phenylketonuria is an inbornerror of metabolism.\nLimited support —A predetermined period of assis-\ntance required to deal with a specific event, such astraining for a new job.\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) —An inborn error in metab-\nolism that prevents the body from using phenylala-nine, an amino acid necessary for normal growthand development.\nTrisomy —An abnormality in chromosomal devel-\nopment. Chromosomes are the structures within acell that carry its genetic information. They areorganized in pairs. Humans have 23 pairs of chro-mosomes. In a trisomy syndrome, an extra chromo-some is present so that the individual has three of aparticular chromosome instead of the normal pair.An extra chromosome 18 (trisomy 18) causes men-tal retardation.\nUltrasonography —A process that uses the reflec-\ntion of high-frequency sound waves to make animage of structures deep within the body. Ultra-sonography is routinely used to detect fetal abnor-malities.\nare development of an extra chromosome 18 (trisomy 18)\nand Down syndrome . Down syndrome, also called mon-\ngolism or trisomy 21, is caused by an abnormality in thedevelopment of chromosome 21. It is the most commongenetic cause of mental retardation.\nPrenatal illnesses and issues\nFetal alcohol syndrome affects one in 600 children\nin the United States. It is caused by excessive alcoholintake in the first twelve weeks (trimester) of pregnancy .\nSome studies have shown that even moderate alcohol useduring pregnancy may cause learning disabilities in chil-dren. Drug abuse and cigarette smoking during pregnan-\ncy have also been linked to mental retardation.\nMaternal infections and illnesses such as glandular\ndisorders, rubella ,toxoplasmosis , and cytomegalovirus\ninfection may cause mental retardation. When the moth-\ner has high blood pressure ( hypertension ) or blood poi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2174Mental retardationsoning (toxemia), the flow of oxygen to the fetus may be\nreduced, causing brain damage and mental retardation.\nBirth defects that cause physical deformities of the\nhead, brain, and central nervous system frequently causemental retardation. Neural tube defect, for example, is abirth defect in which the neural tube that forms the spinalcord does not close completely. This defect may causechildren to develop an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluidon the brain ( hydrocephalus ). Hydrocephalus can cause\nlearning impairment by putting pressure on the brain.\nChildhood illnesses and injuries\nHyperthyroidism ,whooping cough ,chickenpox ,\nmeasles , and Hib disease (a bacterial infection) may\ncause mental retardation if they are not treated adequate-ly. An infection of the membrane covering the brain(meningitis) or an inflammation of the brain itself(encephalitis) cause swelling that in turn may cause braindamage and mental retardation. Traumatic brain injurycaused by a blow or a violent shake to the head may alsocause brain damage and mental retardation in children.\nEnvironmental factors\nIgnored or neglected infants who are not provided\nthe mental and physical stimulation required for normaldevelopment may suffer irreversible learning impair-ments. Children who live in poverty and suffer from mal-\nnutrition , unhealthy living conditions, and improper or\ninadequate medical care are at a higher risk. Exposure tolead can also cause mental retardation. Many childrenhave developed lead poisoning by eating the flaking\nlead-based paint often found in older buildings.\nDiagnosis\nIf mental retardation is suspected, a comprehensive\nphysical examination and medical history should be\ndone immediately to discover any organic cause ofsymptoms. Conditions such as hyperthyroidism andPKU are treatable. If these conditions are discoveredearly, the progression of retardation can be stopped and,in some cases, partially reversed. If a neurological causesuch as brain injury is suspected, the child may bereferred to a neurologist or neuropsychologist for testing.\nA complete medical, family, social, and educational\nhistory is compiled from existing medical and schoolrecords (if applicable) and from interviews with parents.Children are given intelligence tests to measure theirlearning abilities and intellectual functioning. Such testsinclude the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, the Wech-sler Intelligence Scales, the Wechsler Preschool and Pri-mary Scale of Intelligence, and the Kaufmann Assess-ment Battery for Children. For infants, the Bayley Scales\nof Infant Development may be used to assess motor, lan-guage, and problem-solving skills. Interviews with par-ents or other caregivers are used to assess the child’sdaily living, muscle control, communication, and socialskills. The Woodcock-Johnson Scales of IndependentBehavior and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale(V ABS) are frequently used to test these skills.\nTreatment\nFederal legislation entitles mentally retarded children\nto free testing and appropriate, individualized educationand skills training within the school system from ages 3-21.For children under the age of three, many states have estab-lished early intervention programs that assess, recommend,and begin treatment programs. Many day schools are avail-able to help train retarded children in basic skills such asbathing and feeding themselves. Extracurricular activitiesand social programs are also important in helping retardedchildren and adolescents gain self-esteem.\nTraining in independent living and job skills is often\nbegun in early adulthood. The level of training dependson the degree of retardation. Mildly retarded individualscan often acquire the skills needed to live independentlyand hold an outside job. Moderate to profoundly retardedindividuals usually require supervised community living.\nFamily therapy can help relatives of the mentally\nretarded develop coping skills. It can also help parentsdeal with feelings of guilt or anger. A supportive, warmhome environment is essential to help the mentallyretarded reach their full potential.\nPrognosis\nIndividuals with mild to moderate mental retardation\nare frequently able to achieve some self-sufficiency andto lead happy and fulfilling lives. To reach these goals,they need appropriate and consistent educational, com-munity, social, family, and vocational supports. The out-look is less promising for those with severe to profoundretardation. Studies have shown that these individualshave a shortened life expectancy. The diseases that areusually associated with severe retardation may cause theshorter life span. People with Down syndrome willdevelop the brain changes that characterize Alzheimer’s\ndisease in later life and may develop the clinical symp-\ntoms of this disease as well.\nPrevention\nImmunization against diseases such as measles and\nHib prevents many of the illnesses that can cause mental\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2175Mental retardationretardation. In addition, all children should undergo rou-\ntine developmental screening as part of their pediatriccare. Screening is particularly critical for those childrenwho may be neglected or undernourished or may live indisease-producing conditions. Newborn screening andimmediate treatment for PKU and hyperthyroidism canusually catch these disorders early enough to preventretardation.\nGood prenatal care can also help prevent retardation.\nPregnant women should be educated about the risks ofdrinking and the need to maintain good nutrition during\npregnancy. Tests such as amniocentesis and ultrasonog-\nraphy can determine whether a fetus is developing nor-mally in the womb.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

    "title": "Mental status examination",
    "content": "Mental status examination\nDefinition\nA mental status examination (MSE) is an assessment\nof a patient’s level of cognitive (knowledge-related) abil-ity, appearance, emotional mood, and speech and thoughtpatterns at the time of evaluation. It is one part of a fullneurologic (nervous system) examination and includesthe examiner’s observations about the patient’s attitudeand cooperativeness as well as the patient’s answers tospecific questions. The most commonly used test of cog-nitive functioning per se is the so-called Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), developed in 1975.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a mental status examination is to\nassess the presence and extent of a person’s mentalimpairment. The cognitive functions that are measuredduring the MSE include the person’s sense of time, place,and personal identity; memory; speech; general intellec-tual level; mathematical ability; insight or judgment; andreasoning or problem-solving ability. Complete MSEs aremost commonly given to elderly people and to otherpatients being evaluated for dementia (including AIDS-\nrelated dementia). Dementia is an overall decline in a per-son’s intellectual function— including difficulties withlanguage, simple calculations, planning or decision-mak-ing, and motor (muscular movement) skills as well as lossof memory. The MSE is an important part of the differen-tial diagnosis of dementia and other psychiatric symp-toms or disorders. The MSE results may suggest specificareas for further testing or specific types of required tests.A mental status examination can also be given repeatedlyto monitor or document changes in a patient’s condition.\nPrecautions\nA MSE cannot be given to a patient who cannot pay\nattention to the examiner, for example as a result of beingin a coma or unconscious; or is completely unable to speak\n(aphasic); or is not fluent in the language of the examiner.\nDescription\nThe MMSE of Folstein evaluates five areas of men-\ntal status, namely, orientation, registration, attention andcalculation, recall and language. A complete MSE ismore comprehensive and evaluates the following 10areas of functioning:\n• Appearance. The examiner notes the person’s age, race,\nsex, civil status, and overall appearance. These featuresare significant because poor personal hygiene orgrooming may reflect a loss of interest in self-care orphysical inability to bathe or dress oneself.\n• Movement and behavior. The examiner observes the\nperson’s gait (manner of walking), posture, coordina-tion, eye contact, facial expressions, and similar behav-iors. Problems with walking or coordination mayreflect a disorder of the central nervous system.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2176Mental status examination• Affect. Affect refers to a person’s outwardly observable\nemotional reactions. It may include either a lack ofemotional response to an event or an overreaction.\n• Mood. Mood refers to the underlying emotional\n“atmosphere” or tone of the person’s answers.\n• Speech. The examiner evaluates the volume of the per-\nson’s voice, the rate or speed of speech, the length ofanswers to questions, the appropriateness and clarity ofthe answers, and similar characteristics.\n• Thought content. The examiner assesses what the\npatient is saying for indications of hallucinations ,\ndelusions , obsessions, symptoms of dissociation, or\nthoughts of suicide. Dissociation refers to the splitting-off of certain memories or mental processes from con-scious awareness. Dissociative symptoms include feel-ings of unreality, depersonalization, and confusionabout one’s identity.\n• Thought process. Thought process refers to the logical\nconnections between thoughts and their relevance to themain thread of conversation. Irrelevant detail, repeatedwords and phrases, interrupted thinking (thought block-ing), and loose, illogical connections between thoughts,may be signs of a thought disorder.\n• Cognition. Cognition refers to the act or condition of\nknowing. The evaluation assesses the person’s orienta-KEY TERMS\nAphasia —The loss of the ability to speak, or to\nunderstand written or spoken language. A personwho cannot speak or understand language is said tobe aphasic.\nCognition —The act or process of knowing or per-\nceiving.\nComa —A state of prolonged unconsciousness in\nwhich a person cannot respond to spoken com-mands or mildly painful physical stimuli.\nDelusion —A belief that is resistant to reason or con-\ntrary to actual fact. Common delusions include delu-sions of persecution, delusions about one’s impor-tance (sometimes called delusions of grandeur), ordelusions of being controlled by others.\nDementia —A decline in a person’s level of intellec-\ntual functioning. Dementia includes memory loss aswell as difficulties with language, simple calcula-tions, planning or decision-making, and motor(muscular movement) skills.Dissociation —The splitting off of certain mental\nprocesses from conscious awareness. Specificsymptoms of dissociation include feelings of unreal-ity, depersonalization, and confusion about one’sidentity.\nHallucination —A sensory experience, usually\ninvolving either sight or hearing, of something thatdoes not exist outside the mind.\nIllusion —A false visual perception of an object that\nothers perceive correctly. A common example is thenumber of sightings of “UFOs” that turn out to beairplanes or weather balloons.\nObsession —Domination of thoughts or feelings by\na persistent idea, desire, or image.\nOrganic brain disorder —An organic brain disorder\nrefers to impaired brain function due to damage ordeterioration of brain tissue.\ntion (ability to locate himself or herself) with regard to\ntime, place, and personal identity; long- and short-termmemory; ability to perform simple arithmetic (countingbackward by threes or sevens); general intellectual levelor fund of knowledge (identifying the last five Presi-dents, or similar questions); ability to think abstractly(explaining a proverb); ability to name specified objectsand read or write complete sentences; ability to under-stand and perform a task (showing the examiner how tocomb one’s hair or throw a ball); ability to draw a sim-ple map or copy a design or geometrical figure; abilityto distinguish between right and left.\n• Judgment. The examiner asks the person what he or she\nwould do about a commonsense problem, such as run-ning out of a prescription medication.\n• Insight. Insight refers to a person’s ability to recognize\na problem and understand its nature and severity.\nThe length of time required for a mental status\nexamination depends on the patient’s condition. It maytake as little as five minutes to examine a healthy person.Patients with speech problems or intellectual impair-ments, dementia, or other organic brain disorders mayrequire 15 or 20 minutes. The examiner may choose tospend more time on certain portions of the MSE and lesstime on others, depending on the patient’s condition andanswers.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2177Mental status examinationPreparation\nPreparation for a mental status examination\nincludes a careful medical and psychiatric history of thepatient. The history helps the examiner to interpret thepatient’s appearance and answers with greater accuracy,because some physical illnesses may produce psychi-atric symptoms or require medications that influence thepatient’s mood or attentiveness. The psychiatric historyshould include a family history as well as the patient’spersonal history of development, behavior patterns, andprevious treatment for mental disorders (if any). Symp-toms of dissociation, for example, often point to a histo-ry of childhood abuse , rape, or other severe emotional\ntraumas in adult life. The examiner should also includeinformation about the patient’s occupation, level of edu-cation, marital status, and right- or left-handedness.Information about occupation and education helps inevaluating the patient’s use of language, extent of mem-ory loss, reasoning ability, and similar functions. Hand-edness is important in determining which half of thepatient’s brain is involved in writing, picking up a pen-cil, or other similar tasks that he or she may be asked toperform during the examination.\nAftercare\nDepending on the examiner’s specific observations,\nthe patient may be given additional tests for follow-up.These tests might include blood or urine samples to testfor drug or alcohol abuse, anemia, diabetes, disorders ofthe liver or kidneys, vitamin or thyroid deficiencies, med-ication side effects, or syphilis and AIDS . Brain imaging\n(CT, MRI, or PET scans) may be used to look for signs of\nseizures, strokes, head trauma, brain tumors, or other evi-dence of damage to specific parts of the brain. A spinaltap may be performed if the doctor thinks the patient mayhave an infection of the central nervous system.\nNormal results\nNormal results for a mental status examination\ndepend to some extent on the patient’s history, level ofeducation, and recent life events. For example, adepressed mood is appropriate in the context of a recentdeath or other sad event in the patient’s family but inap-\npropriate in the context of a recent pay raise. Speech pat-terns are often influenced by racial or ethnic backgroundas well as by occupation or schooling. In general, howev-er, the absence of obvious delusions, hallucinations, orthought disorders together with the presence of insight,good judgment, and socially appropriate appearance andbehavior are considered normal results.

Frey, PhD\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2178Mental status examinationMetabolic acidosis\nDefinition\nMetabolic acidosis is a pH imbalance in which the\nbody has accumulated too much acid and does not haveenough bicarbonate to effectively neutralize the effectsof the acid.\nDescription\nMetabolic acidosis, as a disruption of the body’s\nacid/base balance, can be a mild symptom brought on bya lack of insulin, a starvation diet, or a gastrointestinal\ndisorder like vomiting and diarrhea . Metabolic acidosis\ncan indicate a more serious problem with a major organlike the liver, heart, or kidneys. It can also be one of thefirst signs of drug overdose or poisoning .\nCauses and symptoms\nMetabolic acidosis occurs when the body has more\nacid than base in it. Chemists use the term “pH” todescribe how acidic or basic a substance is. Based on ascale of 14, a pH of 7.0 is neutral. A pH below 7.0 is anacid; the lower the number, the stronger the acid. A pHabove 7.0 is a base; the higher the number, the strongerthe base. Blood pH is slightly basic (alkaline), with anormal range of 7.36-7.44.\nAcid is a natural by-product of the breakdown of fats\nand other processes in the body; however, in some condi-tions, the body does not have enough bicarbonate, an acidneutralizer, to balance the acids produced. This can occurwhen the body uses fats for energy instead of carbohy-drates. Conditions where metabolic acidosis can occurinclude chronic alcoholism ,malnutrition , and diabetic\nketoacidosis . Consuming a diet low in carbohydrates and\nhigh in fats can also produce metabolic acidosis. The disor-der may also be a symptom of another condition like kid-ney failure, liver failure, or severe diarrhea. The build-up oflactic acid in the blood due to such conditions as heart fail-\nure,shock , or cancer , induces metabolic acidosis. Some\npoisonings and overdoses ( aspirin , methanol, or ethylene\nglycol) also produce symptoms of metabolic acidosis.\nIn mild cases of metabolic acidosis, symptoms\ninclude headache , lack of energy, and sleepiness.\nBreathing may become fast and shallow. Nausea, vomit-ing, diarrhea, dehydration , and loss of appetite are also\nassociated with metabolic acidosis. Diabetic patientswith symptoms of metabolic acidosis may also havebreath that smells fruity. The patient may lose conscious-ness or become disoriented. Severe cases can producecoma and death .KEY TERMS\nDiabetic ketoacidosis —A condition caused by\nlow insulin levels where the amount of sugar andketones in the blood is high.\npH—A measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of\na solution based on the amount of hydrogen ionsavailable. Based on a scale of 14, a pH of 7.0 isneutral. A pH below 7.0 is an acid; the lower thenumber, the stronger the acid. A pH above 7.0 is abase; the higher the number, the stronger the base.Blood pH is slightly alkaline (basic) with a normalrange of 7.36-7.44.\nDiagnosis\nMetabolic acidosis is suspected based on symptoms,\nbut is usually confirmed by laboratory tests on blood andurine samples. Blood pH below 7.35 confirms the condi-tion. Levels of other blood components, including potas-sium, glucose, ketones, or lactic acid, may also be abovenormal ranges. The level of bicarbonate in the blood willbe low, usually less than 22 mEq/L. Urine pH may fallbelow 4.5 in metabolic acidosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment focuses first on correcting the acid imbal-\nance. Usually, sodium bicarbonate and fluids will beinjected into the blood through a vein. An intravenous linemay be started to administer fluids and allow for the quickinjection of other drugs that may be needed. If the patientis diabetic, insulin may be administered. Drugs to regulateblood pressure or heart rate, to prevent seizures, or to con-trol nausea and vomiting might be given. Vital signs like\npulse, respiration, blood pressure, and body temperaturewill be monitored. The underlying cause of the metabolicacidosis must also be diagnosed and corrected.\nPrognosis\nIf the metabolic acidosis is recognized and treated\npromptly, the patient may have no long-term complications,however, the underlying condition that caused the acidosisneeds to be corrected or managed. Severe metabolic acido-sis that is left untreated will lead to coma and death.\nPrevention\nDiabetic patients need to routinely test their urine\nfor sugar and acetone, strictly follow their appropriate\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2179Metabolic acidosisdiet, and take any medications or insulin to prevent meta-\nbolic acidosis. Patients receiving tube feedings or intra-\nvenous feedings must be monitored to prevent dehydra-tion or the accumulation of ketones or lactic acid.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBennett, J.

    "content": "Metabolic alkalosis\nDefinition\nMetabolic alkalosis is a pH imbalance in which the\nbody has accumulated too much of an alkaline substance,such as bicarbonate, and does not have enough acid toeffectively neutralize the effects of the alkali.\nDescription\nMetabolic alkalosis, as a disturbance of the body’s\nacid/base balance, can be a mild condition, brought on byvomiting, the use of steroids or diuretic drugs, or theoveruse of antacids or laxatives . Metabolic alkalosis can\nalso indicate a more serious problem with a major organsuch as the kidneys.\nCauses and symptoms\nMetabolic alkalosis occurs when the body has more\nbase than acid in the system. Chemists use the term “pH”to decribe how acidic or alkaline (also called basic) asubstance is. Based on a scale of 14, a pH of 7.0 is neu-tral. A pH below 7.0 is an acid; the lower the number, thestronger the acid. A pH above 7.0 is alkaline; the higherthe number, the stronger the alkali. Blood pH is slightlyalkaline, with a normal range of 7.36-7.44. Conditionsthat lead to a reduced amount of fluid in the body, likevomiting or excessive urination due to use of diureticdrugs, change the balance of fluids and salts. The bloodlevels of potassium and sodium can decrease dramatical-ly, causing symptoms of metabolic alkalosis.\nIn cases of metabolic alkalosis, slowed breathing may\nbe an initial symptom. The patient may have episodes ofapnea (not breathing) that may go on 15 seconds or longer.Cyanosis , a bluish or purplish discoloration of the skin,\nmay also develop as a sign of inadequate oxygen intake.Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. Other\nsymptoms can include irritability, twitching, confusion,and picking at bedclothes. Rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeats, and a drop in blood pressure are also symptoms.Severe cases can lead to convulsions and coma .\nDiagnosis\nMetabolic alkalosis may be suspected based on\nsymptoms, but often may not be noticeable. The condi-tion is usually confirmed by laboratory tests on bloodand urine samples. Blood pH above 7.45 confirms thecondition. Levels of other blood components, includingsalts like potassium, sodium, and chloride, fall belownormal ranges. The level of bicarbonate in the blood willbe high, usually greater than 29 mEq/L. Urine pH mayrise to about 7.0 in metabolic alkalosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment focuses first on correcting the imbalance.\nAn intravenous line may be started to administer fluids(generally normal saline, a salt water solution) and allowfor the quick injection of other drugs that may be needed.Potassium chloride will be administered. Drugs to regu-late blood pressure or heart rate, or to control nausea\nand vomiting might be given. Vital signs like pulse, res-\npiration, blood pressure, and body temperature will bemonitored. The underlying cause of the metabolic alkalo-sis must also be diagnosed and corrected.\nPrognosis\nIf metabolic alkalosis is recognized and treated\npromptly, the patient may have no long-term complica-tions; however, the underlying condition that caused thealkalosis needs to be corrected or managed. Severe meta-bolic alkalosis that is left untreated will lead to convul-sions, heart failure , and coma.\nPrevention\nPatients receiving tube feedings or intravenous\nfeedings must be monitored to prevent an imbalance offluids and salts, particularly potassium, sodium, andchloride.

    "content": "Methadone\nDefinition\nMethadone is a powerful narcotic drug in the same\nclass as heroin. This class is known as the opioids.\nPurpose\nMethadone, formerly known as dolophine, is a psy-\nchoactive drug, meaning that it affects the mind or behav-ior. It belongs to the class of opioids, drugs that sharesome of the analgesic properties, and mimic the action ofsome of the body’s naturally occurring chemicals calledpeptides, such as endorphins and enkephalines.\nMethadone is used to relieve chronic pain in cancer\npatients and as a maintenance drug to control withdrawalKEY TERMS\npH—A measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of\na solution based on the amount of hydrogen ionsavailable.

The blocking of these receptors leads to twomajor effects:\n• because these chemical receptors remain blocked by\nmethadone for up to 24 hours, even if a person addictedto heroin takes heroin after the administration ofmethadone, this person is not likely to feel the sameeffects of the heroin as he or she previously felt;\n• because the action of methadone is associated with\nslower and less intense withdrawal symptoms thanthose of heroin, the patient can experience milder opi-ate effects while the addiction is being treated andavoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms associatedwith heroin.\nMethadone has also been shown to reduce cravings\nfor heroin while not altering a person’s mood.\nPrecautions\nMethadone magnifies the effects of alcohol and\nother central nervous system depressants, such as anti-\nhistamines , cold medicines, sedatives, tranquilizers,\nother prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) pain med-ications, barbiturates , seizure medications, muscle\nrelaxants , and certain anesthetics including some dental\nanesthetics. Alcohol and other central nervous systemdepressants should not be taken or consumed whilemethadone is being taken.\nMethadone is a powerful narcotic. It can cause some\npeople to feel drowsy, dizzy, or light-headed. People takingmethadone should not drive a car or operate machinery.\nIntentional or accidental overdose of methadone can\nlead to unconsciousness, coma , or death . The signs of\nmethadone overdose include confusion, difficulty speak-ing, seizures, severe nervousness or restlessness, severedizziness , severe drowsiness, and/or slow or troubled\nbreathing. These symptoms are increased by alcohol orother central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Anyonewho feels that he or she, or someone else, may have over-dosed on methadone, or a combination of methadone andother central nervous system depressants, should seekemergency medical attention for that person at once.\nDescription\nA typical adult dosage for methadone is 5-20 mg as\nan oral solution, 2.5-10 mg as an oral tablet or injection,every four to eight hours as necessary for pain. Whenused for detoxification , methadone is initially given in a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2181Methadonedose of 15-100 mg per day as an oral solution. This dose\nis then decreased until the patient no longer requires themedication. The injection form of methadone is onlyused for detoxification in patients who are unable to takethe medication by mouth.\nPreparation\nNo preparation is generally necessary prior to the\nintake of methadone as a pain reliever. In cases of mainte-nance treatments, it is important to be sure that the patientis not currently intoxicated by alcohol, heroin, other opi-oids, or taking other central nervous system depressants.\nAftercare\nPatients receiving methadone should be monitored\nfor adverse reactions to this drug, and/or possible acci-dental overdose.\nRisks\nMethadone can interfere with or exacerbate certain\nmedical conditions. For these reasons, it is important thatthe prescribing physician be informed of any currentcase, or history of:KEY TERMS\nAnalgesic —Any agent that relieves pain.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) depressant —Any\ndrug that tends to reduce the activity of the centralnervous system. The major drug categories includedin this classification are: alcohol, anesthetics, anti-anxiety medications, antihistamines, antipsychotics,hypnotics, narcotics, sedatives, and tranquilizers.\nEndorphins —Any of several opiate peptides natu-\nrally produced in the brain that bind to certain neu-ron receptors and have the effect of relieving pain.\nEnkephalines —Peptides produced by the body that\nhave analgesic properties.\nMorphine —Morphine is the naturally occurring opi-\noid in the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum. It is apowerful narcotic analgesic, and its primary clinicaluse is in the management of moderately severe tosevere pain. After heroin, morphine has the greatestpotential for addiction of all narcotic analgesics.\nNarcotic —Any drug that produces insensibility or\nstupor and/or generally causes effects similar tothose caused by morphine.Opiate —Any narcotic analgesic derived from a nat-\nural source, such as morphine from the opiumpoppy.\nOpioid receptors —Receptors located in the brain\nand various organs that bind opiates or opioid sub-stances.\nOpioids —One of the major classes of semi or fully\nsynthetic psychoactive drugs that includes meth-adone.\nPsychoactive drugs —Any drug that affects the mind\nor behavior. There are five main classes of psy-choactive drugs: opiates and opioids (e.g. heroinand methadone); stimulants (e.g. cocaine, nicotine),depressants (e.g. tranquilizers, antipsychotics, alco-hol), hallucinogens (e.g. LSD), and marijuana andhashish.\nReceptor —A molecular structure on the surface\nthat selectively binds a specific substance resultingin a specific physiological effect.\n• alcohol abuse\n• brain disease or head injury• colitis• drug dependency, particularly of narcotics• emotional problems• emphysema, asthma , or other chronic lung disease\n• enlarged prostate\n• gallstones or gallbladder disease• heart disease• kidney disease• liver disease• problems with urination• seizures• underactive thyroid\nSide effects\nThe most common side effects of methadone include:\n• constipation• dizziness\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2182Methadone• drowsiness\n• itching• nausea• urine retention• vomiting\nLess common side effects of methadone include:\n• abnormally fast or slow heartbeat\n• blurred or double vision\n• cold, clammy skin\n• depression or other mood changes• dry mouth• fainting• hallucinations•h i v e s• loss of appetite• nightmares or unusual dreams• pinpoint pupils of the eyes• redness or flushing of the face• restlessness• rigid muscles• ringing or buzzing in the ears• seizure\n• severe drowsiness\n• skin reaction at the site of injection• stomach cramps or pain• sweating• trouble sleeping (insomnia)• yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes\nNormal results\nNormal results after the administration of methadone\nto treat chronic pain is the alleviation of that patient’spain, at least to the point where the pain is bearable.\nThe normal result of methadone treatment to control\nheroin addiction is that the patient reduces heroin intakealmost immediately upon starting methadone treatments,followed by complete abstinence, usually within twoweeks after starting treatment.\nResources\nBOOKS\nPreston, Andrew.

    "title": "Methemoglobinemia",
    "content": "Methemoglobinemia\nDefinition\nWhen excessive hemoglobin in the blood is convert-\ned to another chemical that cannot deliver oxygen to tis-sues, called methemoglobin.\nDescription\nThe molecule hemoglobin in the blood is responsible\nfor binding oxygen to give to the body. When hemoglobinis oxidized to methemoglobin its structure changes and itis no longer able to bind oxygen. Hemoglobin is constant-ly under oxidizing stresses: however, normally less than1% of a person’s hemoglobin is in the methemoglobinstate. This is due to the body’s systems that reduce methe-moglobin back to hemoglobin. Infants have a higher riskof acquiring methemoglobinemia because infant hemo-globin is more prone to be oxidized to methemoglobin.\nCauses and symptoms\nMethemoglobinemia can either be congenital or\nacquired.\nThere are two causes of the congenital form. One\ncause is a defect in the body’s systems to reduce methe-moglobin to hemoglobin. The other cause is a mutantform of hemoglobin called hemoglobin M that cannotbind to oxygen. Both of these forms are typically benign.\nAcquired methemoglobinemia is caused by an exter-\nnal source, usually a drug or medication. Some of thesemedications include benzocaine, lidocaine and prilo-caine. These medications can inhibit the body’s systems\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2183Methemoglobinemiaof reducing methemoglobin to hemoglobin resulting in\nmethemoglobinemia.\nWith a methemoglobin level of 3-15% skin can turn\nto a pale gray or blue ( cyanosis ). With levels above 25%\nthe following symptoms may be present:\n• cyanosis unaffected by oxygen administration\n• blood that is dark or chocolate in color that won’t\nchange to red in the presence of oxygen\n• headache\n• weakness\n• confusion\n• chest pain\nWhen methemoglobin levels are above 70% death\nmay result if not treated immediately.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on the symptoms and history. If\nthese are indicative of methemoglobinemia blood testsare performed to confirm the presence and level ofmethemoglobin.\nTreatment\nFor acquired methemoglobinemia the typical treat-\nment is with methylene blue. This is administered withan IV over a five-minute period and results are typicallyseen within 20 minutes. Methylene blue reduces methe-moglobin back to hemoglobin.\nThough congenital methemoglobinemia is usually\nbenign, the form due to a defective reducing system canbe treated with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) taken daily. Theother congenital form due to hemoglobin M has no treat-ment as of late.\nAlternative Treatment\nThere are not any known alternative treatments for\nmethemoglobinemia. Methylene blue, or a similar treat-ment, is needed to reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin.KEY TERMS\nCyanosis —When the body does not receive\nenough oxygen.\nOxidation —When a chemical element or com-\npound loses an electron.\nReduction —When a chemical element or com-\npound gains an electron.Prognosis\nIf found early, acquired methemoglobinemia can be\neasily treated with no side effects. After treatment withmethylene blue the patient can expect a full recovery.\nCongenital methemoglobinemia is typically benign\nand should be observed. If methemoglobinemia symp-toms occur the person should be taken to the hospital fortreatment.\nPrevention\nIf a person gets methemoglobinemia from a certain\nmedication that medication should be avoided at all costsin the future. For people with congenital methemoglo-binemia medications or other things that are known tooxidize hemoglobin should be avoided.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBeutler, Ernest. “Methemoglobinemia and Other Causes of\nCyanois.” In Williams Hematology New York: McGraw-\nHill, 2001, 6th Edition, pp.611-17.\nPERIODICALS\nWright, Lewander and Woolf. “Methemoglobinemia: Etiology,\nPharmacology, and Clinical Management.” Annals of\nEmergency Medicine (November 1999): 646-56.\nWilburn-Goo, Dawn and Lloyd. “When Patients Become\nCyanotic: Acquired Methemoglobinemia.” Journal of the\nAmerican Dental Association (June 1999): 826-31.\nOTHER\neMedicine.

The total absence of an eye is extremelyrare and often a clinical sign associated with a broadrange of genetic disorders or, more commonly, a sporadicmutation. Sporadic transmission occurs in the affectedindividual due to a genetic abnormality. It is not passedon from the parents, but usually due to a combination ofenvironmental and genetic influences. More commonlyanophthalmia clinically presents as a small cyst. Thedefect, which causes anophthalmia, is an absence of theoptic vesicle, a structure important for eye development.The genetic abnormality usually occurs during weeksone to three after conception. It is estimated that the inci-dence of microphthalmia occurs 0.22 times per 1,000live births. Anophthalmia can occur during adult life butnot associated with a genetic cause.\nMicrophthalmia refers to an abnormally small eye.\nThis clinical sign is often associated with autosomaldominant or recessively transmitted genetic disorders.Most disorders dominantly inherited with microph-thalmia are associated with some visual capabilities ininfancy and early childhood. Microphthalmia may beisolated (the only presenting sign) or associated with arange of ocular or systemic abnormalities. Isolated casesof microphthalmia may be sporadic or inherited. There isa variable degree of visual impairment . Microphthalmia\noccurs due to autosomal recessive transmission and ispart of a syndrome associated with abnormalities in theretina or systemic lesions. Microphthalmia results from adevelopmental defect after formation of the optic vesicle.The developmental abnormality causes the optic vesicleto fold inwards, resulting in the formation of a cyst. Thecyst will progressively swell from birth, and it may besituated along the optic nerve. The cyst may also be situ-ated along other important eye structures.\nCauses and symptoms\nMicrophthalmia and anophthalmia can be caused by\nsporadic or genetic mutations. Anophthalmia is charac-terized by a total absence of an eye. Anophthalmia in anadult is usually caused by trauma, infection, tumor, oradvanced eye disease.\nDiagnosis\nMicroscope examination confirms the diagnosis of\ntrue anophthalmia. The clinician examines a piece of tis-sue taken from the eye and notes eviscerated tissue. Formicrophthalmia the confirmation can be established byeye measurements. Eyes that have an axial length <21mm in an adult, or <19 mm in a one-year-old child aredescribed as having microphthalmia.KEY TERMS\nAxial — A straight line passing through a spherical\nbody between its two poles and about which thebody may revolve.\nEviserated — Removal of eye contents.\nProstheses — A synthetic object that resembles a\nmissing anatomical part.\nRetina — A major portion of the eye responsible\nfor reception of visual light rays.\nTreatment\nLarge cysts causing microphthalmia should be aspi-\nrated or removed surgically. There is no known cure foranophthalmia or microphthalmia. For anophthalmia aprosthetic eye can be fitted which may involve surgery.Treatment for microphthalmia depends on the complexi-ty of eye involvement.\nPrognosis\nFor anophthalmia, prosthetic eyes should be seen by\na specialist two to three times per year to assess fit, mobil-ity, and smoothness. They are usually well tolerated andhave good appearance and mobility. The clinical coursefor microphthalmia depends on the extent of smallness,but usually patients progress favorably without majortreatment. Since the smallness is distinctly noticeable,there may be individual cosmetic considerations.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention for either, since these\nclinical signs are commonly associated with geneticinheritance.\nResources\nBOOKS\nYanoff, Myron, et al, eds.

    "content": "Mifepristone\nDefinition\nMifepristone is a pill that can be taken as an alterna-\ntive to a surgical abortion.\nPurpose\nThis medication is best-suited for ending early preg-\nnancies.\nPrecautions\nWomen who are more than seven weeks pregnant (or\n49 days since their last menstrual period) should not takemifepristone. Other reasons to avoid mifepristoneinclude: use of an intrauterine device ( IUD ),ectopic\npregnancy , use of blood thinners, bleeding disorders,\nuse of steroid medications, allergies to mifepristone or\nsimilar drugs and lack of access to medical help withintwo weeks after the treatment.\nDescription\nMifepristone, sold commercially under the name\nMifeprex, also is known as RU-486, the abortion pill, theearly option pill or medical abortion. While it has beenused for many years in Europe, mifepristone has onlybeen available for use in the United States since the U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it in2000 for use in abortion.\nThis drug causes pregnancy to end by blocking the\nfemale hormone progesterone. The lack of progesteronemakes the uterus shed its lining, which causes bleedingsimilar to a menstrual period. Three days after takingmifepristone, women are given a second drug, mispros-tol, to cause uterine contractions that expel the contentsof the uterus. Most women are able to remain in theirown home while they pass the fetus, and many prefer tohave this privacy.\nPreparation\nBefore taking mifepristone, healthcare providers\nlikely will give the woman a urine or blood test to be surethat she is, in fact, pregnant. They also may give her somecounseling and support. Once she has made the decisionto use mifepristone, they will ask her to sign a writtenstatement that she has decided to end her pregnancy.\nAftercare\nUsing mifepristone and misoprostol causes heavy\nbleeding and cramping. Doctors can offer pain medicine,\nsuch as Motrin, to ease the cramps. For two weeks aftertreatment with mifepristone, healthcare providers likelywill ask patients to abstain from sexual intercourse,heavy lifting and strenuous exercise . They also may\nadvise against breastfeeding, since scientists are not sureif the drug is present in breast milk.\nPhysicians require patients to come in for a follow-\nup visit 14 days after their first dose of mifepristone toverify that they are no longer pregnant and that they areproperly healing.\nRisks\nOther common side effects include: fatigue , head-\naches, dizziness , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and low-\nback pain.\nSince pregnancy hormones are in flux after a med-\nical abortion, many women have emotional side-effects,such as mood swings, depression or a mild case of theblues. These feelings usually subside when hormonesstabilize a few weeks later. For those who feel stuck intheir grief or anger about the situation, counseling orsupport groups may offer relief.\nNormal results\nMost women feel better after about two weeks.\nBleeding and spotting usually occurs for nine to 16 days,but may last for a month.\nAbnormal results\nIn some cases, mifepristone does not completely end\nthe pregnancy. If the fetus is still left inside the uterus, a doc-tor may recommend a surgical abortion, or a procedurecalled dilation and curettage (D and C). About five to eightout of 100 women who take mifepristone go on to have asurgical abortion, according to the FDA. During a D and C,which usually is done at a hospital or clinic under a localanesthetic, a physician dilates the cervix, then uses aninstrument to scrape any residual tissue away from the wallsof the uterus. This allows the heavy bleeding to eventuallystop so a woman can return to her normal cycle sooner.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLader, Lawrence and Eleanor Smeal.

    "title": "Migraine headache",
    "content": "Migraine headache\nDefinition\nMigraine is a type of headache marked by severe\nhead pain lasting several hours or more.\nDescription\nMigraine is an intense, often debilitating type of\nheadache. Migraines affect as many as 24 million peoplein the United States, and are responsible for billions ofdollars in lost work, poor job performance, and directmedical costs. Approximately 18% of women and 6% ofmen experience at least one migraine attack per year.More than three million women and one million menhave one or more severe headaches every month.Migraines often begin in adolescence, and are rare afterage 60.\nTwo types of migraine are recognized. Eighty per-\ncent of migraine sufferers experience “migraine withoutaura,” formerly called common migraine. In “migrainewith aura,” formerly called classic migraine, pain is pre-ceded or accompanied by visual or other sensory distur-bances, including hallucinations , partial obstruction of\nthe visual field, numbness or tingling, or a feeling ofheaviness. Symptoms are often most prominent on oneside of the body, and may begin as early as 72 hoursbefore the onset of pain.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThe physiological basis of migraine has proved diffi-\ncult to uncover. Genetics appear to play a part for many,but not all, people with migraine. There are a multitudeof potential triggers for a migraine attack, and recogniz-ing one’s own set of triggers is the key to prevention.PHYSIOLOGY. The most widely accepted hypothesis\nof migraine suggests that a migraine attack is precipitat-\ned when pain-sensing nerve cells in the brain (callednociceptors) release chemicals called neuropeptides. Atleast one of the neurotransmitters, substance P, increasesthe pain sensitivity of other nearby nociceptors.\nOther neuropeptides act on the smooth muscle sur-\nrounding cranial blood vessels. This smooth muscle regu-lates blood flow in the brain by relaxing or contracting,thus constricting the enclosed blood vessels and stimulat-ing adjacent pain receptors. At the onset of a migraineheadache, neuropeptides are thought to cause musclerelaxation, allowing vessel dilation and increased bloodflow. Other neuropeptides increase the leakiness of cra-nial vessels, allowing fluid leak, and promote inflamma-tion and tissue swelling. The pain of migraine is thoughtto result from this combination of increased pain sensitiv-ity, tissue and vessel swelling, and inflammation. Theaura seen during a migraine may be related to constrictionin the blood vessels that dilate in the headache phase.\nGENETICS. Susceptibility to migraine may be inher-\nited. A child of a migraine sufferer has as much as a 50%chance of developing migraine. If both parents are affect-ed, the chance rises to 70%. However, the gene or genesresponsible have not been identified, and many cases ofmigraine have no obvious familial basis. It is likely thatwhatever genes are involved set the stage for migraine,and that full development requires environmental influ-ences as well.\nTRIGGERS. A wide variety of foods, drugs, environ-\nmental cues, and personal events are known to triggermigraines. It is not known how most triggers set off theevents of migraine, nor why individual migraine suffer-ers are affected by particular triggers but not others.\nCommon food triggers include:\n• cheese\n• alcohol\n•caffeine products, and caffeine withdrawal\n• chocolate\n• intensely sweet foods\n• dairy products\n• fermented or pickled foods\n• citrus fruits\n• nuts\n• processed foods, especially those containing nitrites,\nsulfites, or monosodium glutamate (msg)\nEnvironmental and event-related triggers include:\n•stress or time pressure\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2187Migraine headache• menstrual periods, menopause\n• sleep changes or disturbances, oversleeping• prolonged overexertion or uncomfortable posture• hunger or fasting\n• odors, smoke, or perfume\n• strong glare or flashing lights\nDrugs which may trigger migraine include:\n• oral contraceptives\n• estrogen replacement therapy• nitrates• theophylline\n• reserpine\n• nifedipine• indomethicin• cimetidine• decongestant overuse• analgesic overuse• benzodiazepine withdrawal\nSymptoms\nMigraine without aura may be preceded by eleva-\ntions in mood or energy level for up to 24 hours beforethe attack. Other pre-migraine symptoms may includefatigue , depression, and excessive yawning.\nAura most often begins with shimmering, jagged\narcs of white or colored light progressing over the visualfield in the course of 10-20 minutes. This may be preced-ed or replaced by dark areas or other visual disturbances.Numbness and tingling is common, especially of the\nface and hands. These sensations may spread, and maybe accompanied by a sensation of weakness or heavinessin the affected limb.\nThe pain of migraine is often present only on one\nside of the head, although it may involve both, or switchsides during attacks. The pain is usually throbbing, andmay range from mild to incapacitating. It is often accom-panied by nausea or vomiting, painful sensitivity to lightand sound, and intolerance of food or odors. Blurredvision is common.\nMigraine pain tends to intensify over the first 30\nminutes to several hours, and may last from several hoursto a day or longer. Afterward, the affected person is usu-ally weary, and sensitive to sudden head movements.\nDiagnosis\nMigraine is diagnosed by a careful medical history.\nLab tests and imaging studies such as computed tomog-raphy (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nscans have not been useful for identifying migraine.However, for some patients, those tests may be needed torule out a brain tumor or other structural causes of\nmigraine headache.\nTreatment\nOnce a migraine begins, the person will usually seek\nout a dark, quiet room to lessen painful stimuli. Severaldrugs may be used to reduce the pain and severity of theattack.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nare helpful for early and mild headache. NSAIDs includeacetaminophen , ibuprofen, naproxen, and others. A\nrecent study concluded that a combination of aceta-minophen, aspirin , and caffeine could effectively relieve\nsymptoms for many migraine patients. One such over-the-counter preparation is available as Exedrin Migraine.\nMore severe or unresponsive attacks may be treated\nwith drugs that act on serotonin receptors in the smoothmuscle surrounding cranial blood vessels. Serotonin,also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, constricts these ves-sels, relieving migraine pain. Drugs that mimic serotoninand bind to these receptors have the same effect. The old-est of them is ergotamine, a derivative of a common grainfungus. Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are used forboth acute and preventive treatment. Derivatives withfewer side effects have come onto the market in the pastdecade, including sumatriptan (Imitrex). Some of thesedrugs are available as nasal sprays, intramuscular injec-tions, or rectal suppositories for patients in whom vomit-ing precludes oral administration. Other drugs used foracute attacks include meperidine and metoclopramide.\nStudies are showing that rizatriptan is a promising\ndrug for the treatment of migraines. One study showedthat 10mg of rizatriptan provided relief to 90% of thepatients in the study group and kept 50% of them pain-free 2 hours after taking the medication. Sumatriptan hasbeen on the market since 1993, while rizatriptan becameavailable in 1998.\nContinued use of some anti-migraine drugs can lead\nto “rebound headache,” marked by frequent or chronicheadaches, especially in the early morning hours.Rebound headache is avoided by using anti-migrainedrugs under a doctor’s supervision, with the minimumdose necessary to treat symptoms. Patients with frequentmigraines may need preventive therapy.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments are aimed at prevention of\nmigraine. Migraine headaches are often linked with food\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2188Migraine headacheallergies or intolerances. Identification and elimination\nof the offending food or foods can decrease the frequen-cy of migraines and/or alleviate these headaches alto-gether. Herbal therapy with feverfew ( Chrysanthemum\nparthenium ) may lessen the frequency of attacks. Learn-\ning to increase the flow of blood to the extremitiesthrough biofeedback training may allow a patient to pre-\nvent some of the vascular changes once a migrainebegins. During a migraine, keep the lights low; put thefeet in a tub of hot water and place a cold cloth on theoccipital region (the back of the head). This draws theblood to the feet and decreases the pressure in the head.\nPrognosis\nMost people with migraines can bring their attacks\nunder control through recognizing and avoiding triggers,and by use of appropriate drugs when migraine occurs.Some people with severe migraines do not respond topreventive or drug therapy. Migraines usually wane inintensity by age 60 and beyond.\nPrevention\nThe frequency of migraine may be lessened by\navoiding triggers. It is useful to keep a headache journal,recording the particulars and noting possible triggers foreach attack. Specific measures which may help include:\n• eating at regular times, and not skipping meals\n• reducing the use of caffeine and pain relievers• restricting physical exertion, especially on hot days\n• keeping regular sleep hours, but not oversleeping\n• managing time to avoid stress at work and home\nSome drugs can be used for migraine prevention,\nincluding specific members of these drug classes:\n• beta blockers\n• tricyclic antidepressants• calcium channel blockers• anticonvulsants\n• prozac\n• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (mao)• serotonin antagonists\nFor most patients, preventive drug therapy is not an\nappropriate option, since it requires continued use ofpowerful drugs. However, for women whose migrainescoincide with the menstrual period, limited preventivetreatment may be effective. Since these drugs are appro-priate for patients with other medical conditions, thedecision to prescribe them for migraine may be influ-enced by expected benefit elsewhere.Resources\nBOOKS\nLarson, David E.

    "title": "Mineral deficiency",
    "content": "Mineral deficiency\nDefinition\nThe term mineral deficiency means a condition\nwhere the concentration of any one of the minerals\nessential to human health is abnormally low in the body.In some cases, an abnormally low mineral concentrationis defined as that which leads to an impairment in a func-tion dependent on the mineral. In other cases, the con-vention may be to define an abnormally low mineral con-centration as a level lower than that found in a specifichealthy population.\nThe mineral nutrients are defined as all the inorganic\nelements or inorganic molecules that are required for life.As far as human nutrition is concerned, the inorganic\nnutrients include water, sodium, potassium, chloride, calci-um, phosphate, sulfate, magnesium, iron, copper, zinc,manganese, iodine, selenium, and molybdenum. Some ofthe inorganic nutrients, such as water, do not occur as sin-gle atoms, but occur as molecules. Other inorganic nutri-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2189Mineral deficiencyents that are molecules include phosphate, sulfate, and\nselenite. Phosphate contains an atom of phosphorus. Sul-fate contains an atom of sulfur. We do not need to eat sul-fate, since the body can acquire all the sulfate it needs fromprotein. Selenium occurs in foods as selenite and selenate.\nThere is some evidence that other inorganic nutri-\nents, such as chromium and boron, play a part in humanhealth, but their role is not well established. Fluoride hasbeen proven to increase the strength of bones and teeth,but there is little or no reason to believe that is needed forhuman life.\nThe mineral content of the body may be measured\nby testing samples of blood plasma, red blood cells, orurine. In the case of calcium and phosphate deficiency,the diagnosis may also involve taking x rays of the skele-ton. In the case of iodine deficiency, the diagnosis mayinclude examining the patient’s neck with the eyes andhands. In the case of iron deficiency, the diagnosis mayinclude the performance of a stair-stepping test by thepatient. Since all the minerals serve strikingly differentfunctions in the body, the tests for the correspondingdeficiency are markedly different from each other.\nDescription\nLaboratory studies with animals have revealed that\nsevere deficiencies in any one of the inorganic nutrientscan result in very specific symptoms, and finally indeath , due to the failure of functions associated with that\nnutrient. In humans, deficiency in one nutrient may occurless often than deficiency in several nutrients. A patientsuffering from malnutrition is deficient in a variety of\nnutrients. In the United States, malnutrition is most oftenfound among severe alcoholics. In part, this is becausethe alcohol consumption may supply half of the energyrequirement, resulting in a mineral and vitamin intake ofhalf the expected level. Deficiencies in one nutrient dooccur, for example, in human populations living iniodine-poor regions of the world, and in iron deficientpersons who looses excess iron by abnormal bleeding.\nInorganic nutrients have a great variety of functions\nin the body. Water, sodium, and potassium deficienciesare most closely associated with abnormal nerve actionand cardiac arrhythmias . Deficiencies in these nutrients\ntend to result not from a lack of content in the diet, butfrom excessive losses due to severe diarrhea and other\ncauses. Iodine deficiency is a global public health prob-lem. It occurs in parts of the world with iodine-deficientsoils, and results in goiter , which involves a relatively\nharmless swelling of the neck, and cretinism, a severebirth defect. The only use of iodine in the body is formaking thyroid hormone. However, since thyroid hor-mone has a variety of roles in development of theembryo, iodine deficiency during pregnancy results in a\nnumber of birth defects .\nCalcium deficiency due to lack of dietary calcium\noccurs only rarely. However, calcium deficiency due tovitamin D deficiency can be found among certain popu-\nlations. Vitamin D is required for the efficient absorptionof calcium from the diet, and hence vitamin D deficiencyin growing infants and children can result in calciumdeficiency.\nDietary phosphate deficiency is rare because phos-\nphate is plentiful in plant and animal foods, but alsobecause phosphate is efficiently absorbed from the dietinto the body. Iron deficiency causes anemia (lack of redblood cells), which results in tiredness and shortness of\nbreath .\nDietary deficiencies in the remaining inorganic nutri-\nents tend to be rare. Magnesium deficiency is uncommon,but when it occurs it tends to occur in chronic alcoholics,in persons taking diuretic drugs, and in those sufferingfrom severe and prolonged diarrhea. Magnesium defi-ciency tends to occur with the same conditions that pro-voke deficiencies in sodium and potassium. Zinc defi-ciency is rare, but it has been found in impoverished pop-ulations in the Middle East, who rely on unleavenedwhole wheat bread as a major food source. Copper defi-ciency is also rare, but dramatic and health-threateningchanges in copper metabolism occur in two genetic dis-eases, Wilson’s disease and Menkes’ disease.\nSelenium deficiency may occur in regions of the\nworld where the soils are poor in selenium. Low-seleni-um soils can produce foods that are also low in selenium.Premature infants may also be at risk for selenium defi-ciency. Manganese deficiency is very rare. Experimentalstudies with humans fed a manganese deficient diet haverevealed that the deficiency produces a scaly, red rash onthe skin of the upper torso. Molybdenum deficiency hasprobably never occurred, but indirect evidence suggeststhat if molybdenum deficiency could occur, it wouldresult in mental retardation and death.\nCauses and symptoms\nSodium deficiency ( hyponatremia ) and water defi-\nciency are the most serious and widespread deficienciesin the world. These deficiencies tend to arise from exces-sive losses from the body, as during prolonged and severediarrhea or vomiting. Diarrheal diseases are a majorworld health problem, and are responsible for about aquarter of the 10 million infant deaths that occur eachyear. Nearly all of these deaths occur in impoverishedparts of Africa and Asia, where they result from contami-nation of the water supply by animal and human feces.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2190Mineral deficiencyThe main concern in treating diarrheal diseases is\ndehydration , that is, the losses of sodium and water\nwhich deplete the fluids of the circulatory system (theheart, veins, arteries, and capillaries). Severe losses ofthe fluids of the circulatory system result in shock .\nShock nearly always occurs when dehydration is severeenough to produce a 10% reduction in body weight.Shock, which is defined as inadequate supply of blood tothe various tissues of the body, results in a lack of oxygento all the cells of the body. Although diarrheal fluids con-tain a number of electrolytes, the main concern in avoid-ing shock is the replacement of sodium and water.\nSodium deficiency and potassium deficiency also\nfrequently result during treatment with drugs calleddiuretics . Diuretics work because they cause loss of\nsodium from the body. These drugs are used to treat highblood pressure ( hypertension ), where the resulting\ndecline in blood pressure reduces the risk for cardiovas-cular disease. However, diuretics can lead to sodiumdeficiency, resulting in low plasma sodium levels. A sideeffect of some diuretics is excessive loss of potassium,and low plasma potassium ( hypokalemia ) may result.\nIodine deficiency tends to occur in regions of the\nworld where the soil is poor in iodine. Where soil used inagriculture is poor in iodine, the foods grown in the soilwill also be low in iodine. An iodine intake of 0.10-0.15mg/day is considered to be nutritionally adequate, whileiodine deficiency occurs at below 0.05 mg/day. Goiter,an enlargement of the thyroid gland (located in the neck),results from iodine deficiency. Goiter continues to be aproblem in eastern Europe, parts of India and SouthAmerica, and in Southeast Asia. Goiter has been eradi-cated in the United States because of the fortification offoods with iodine. Iodine deficiency during pregnancyresults in cretinism in the newborn. Cretinism involvesmental retardation, a large tongue, and sometimes deaf-ness, muteness, and lameness.\nIron deficiency occurs due to periods of dietary defi-\nciency, rapid growth, and excessive loss of the body’siron. Human milk and cow milk both contains low levelsof iron. Infants are at risk for acquiring iron deficiencybecause their rapid rate of growth needs a correspondingincreased supply of dietary iron, for use in making bloodand muscles. Human milk is a better source of iron thancow milk, since about half of the iron in human breastmilk is absorbed by the infant’s digestive tract. In con-trast, only 10% of the iron in cow milk is absorbed by theinfant. Surveys of lower-income families in the UnitedStates have revealed that about 6% of the infants are ane-mic indicating a deficiency of iron in their diets . Blood\nloss that occurs with menstruation in women, as well aswith a variety of causes of intestinal bleeding is a majorcause of iron deficiency. The symptoms of iron deficien-cy are generally limited to anemia, and the resulting\ntiredness, weakness, and a reduced ability to performphysical work.\nCalcium and phosphate are closely related nutrients.\nAbout 99% of the calcium and 85% of the phosphate inthe body occur in the skeleton, where they exist as crys-tals of solid calcium phosphate. Both of these nutrientsoccur in a great variety of foods. Milk, eggs, and green,leafy vegetables are rich in calcium and phosphate.Whole cow milk, for example, contains about 1.2 g calci-um and 0.95 g phosphorus per kg of food. Broccoli con-tains 1.0 g calcium and 0.67 g phosphorus per kg food.Eggs supply about one third of the calcium and phos-phate of the overall population of the United States.Dietary deficiencies in calcium ( hypocalcemia ) or phos-\nphate are extremely rare throughout the world. Vitamin Ddeficiency can be found among young infants, the elder-ly, and others who may be shielded from sunshine forprolonged periods of time. Vitamin D deficiency impairsthe absorption of calcium from the diet, and in this waycan provoke calcium deficiency even when the diet con-tains adequate calcium.\nZinc deficiency has been found among peasant popu-\nlations in rural areas of the Middle East. Unleavenedwhole wheat bread can account for 75% of the energyintake in these areas. This diet, which does not containmeat, does contain zinc, but it also contains phytic acid ata level of about 3 g/day. The phytic acid, which naturallyoccurs in wheat, inhibits zinc absorption. The yeast usedto leaven bread produces enzymes that inactivate thephytic acid. Unleavened bread does not contain yeast, andtherefore, contains intact phytic acid. The symptoms ofzinc deficiency include lack of sexual maturation, lack ofpubic hair, and small stature. The amount of phytic acid ina typical American diet cannot provoke zinc deficiency.\nZinc deficiency is relatively uncommon in the Unit-\ned States, but it may occur in adults with alcoholism or\nintestinal malabsorption problems. Low plasma zinc hasbeen found in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis ,Crohn’s\ndisease , and celiac disease . Experimental studies with\nhumans have shown that the signs of zinc deficiency aredetectable after two to five weeks of consumption of thezinc-free diet. The signs include a rash and diarrhea. Therash occurs on the face, groin, hands, and feet. Thesesymptoms can easily be reversed by administering zinc.An emerging concern is that increased calcium intakecan interfere with zinc absorption or retention. Hence,there is some interest in the question of whether personstaking calcium to prevent osteoporosis should also take\nzinc supplements.\nSevere alterations in copper metabolism occur in\ntwo genetic diseases, Wilson’s disease and Menkes’ dis-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2191Mineral deficiencyease. Both of these diseases are rare and occur in about\none in 100,000 births. Both diseases involve mutations incopper transport proteins, that is, in special channels thatallow the passage of copper ions through cell mem-branes. Menkes’ disease is a genetic disease involvingmental retardation and death before the age of threeyears. The disease also results in steely or kinky hair. Thehair is tangled, grayish, and easily broken. Menkes’ dis-ease involves a decrease in copper levels in the serum,liver, and brain, and increases in copper in the cells of theintestines and kidney.\nSelenium deficiency may occur in premature infants,\nsince this population naturally tends to have low levels ofplasma selenium. Full term infants have plasma seleniumlevels of about 0.001-0.002 mM, while premature infantsmay have levels about one third this amount. Whetherthese lower levels result in adverse consequences is notclear. Selenium deficiency occurs in regions of the worldcontaining low-selenium soils. These regions includeKeshan Province in China, New Zealand, and Finland. InKeshan Province, a disease (Keshan disease) occurswhich results in deterioration of regions of the heart andthe development of fibers in these regions. Keshan dis-ease, which may be fatal, is thought to result from a com-bination of selenium deficiency and a virus.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of deficiencies in water, sodium,\npotassium, iron, calcium, and phosphate involve chemicaltesting of the blood plasma, urine, and red blood cells.\nIodine deficiency can be diagnosed by measuring\nthe concentration of iodine in the urine. A urinary levelgreater than 0.05 mg iodine per gram creatinine meansadequate iodine status. Levels under 0.025 mg iodine/gcreatinine indicate a serious risk.\nNormal blood serum magnesium levels are 1.2-2.0\nmM. Magnesium deficiency results in hypomagnesemia,which is defined as serum magnesium levels below 0.8KEY TERMS\nRecommended Dietary Allowance —The Recom-\nmended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are quantitiesof nutrients that are required each day to maintainhuman health. RDAs are established by the Foodand Nutrition Board of the National Academy ofSciences and may be revised every few years. Aseparate RDA value exists for each nutrient.mM. Magnesium levels below 0.5 mM provoke a decline\nin serum calcium levels. Hypomagnesemia can alsoresult in low serum potassium. Some of the symptoms ofhypomagnesemia, which include twitching and convul-sions, actually result from the hypocalcemia. Othersymptoms of hypomagnesemia, such as cardiac arrhyth-mias, result from the low potassium levels.\nThere is no reliable test for zinc deficiency. When\nhumans eat diets containing normal levels of zinc (16mg/day), the level of urinary zinc is about 0.45 mg/day,while humans consuming low-zinc diets (0.3 mg/day)may have urinary levels of about 0.150 mg/day. Plasmazinc levels tend to be maintained during a dietary defi-ciency in zinc. Plasma and urinary zinc levels can beinfluenced by a variety of factors, and for this reasoncannot provide a clear picture of zinc status.\nSelenium deficiency may be diagnosed by measur-\ning the selenium in plasma (70 ng/mL) or red blood cells(90 ng/mL), where the normal values are indicated.There is also some interest in measuring the activity ofan enzyme in blood platelets, in order to assess seleniumstatus. This enzyme is glutathione peroxidase. Plateletsare small cells of the bloodstream which are used mainlyto allow the clotting of blood after an injury.\nTreatment\nThe treatment of deficiencies in sodium, potassium,\ncalcium, phosphate, and iron usually involves intra-venous injections of the deficient mineral.\nIodine deficiency can be easily prevented and treated\nby fortifying foods with iodine. Table salt is fortifiedwith 100 mg potassium iodide per kg sodium chloride.Goiter was once common in the United States in areasfrom Washington State to the Great Lakes region, but thisproblem has been eliminated by iodized salt. Publichealth programs in impoverished countries have involvedinjections of synthetic oils containing iodine. Goiter isreversible but, cretinism is not.\nMagnesium deficiency can be treated with a magne-\nsium rich diet. If magnesium deficiency is due to a pro-longed period of depletion, treatment may include injec-tions of magnesium sulfate (2.0 mL of 50% MgSO\n4).\nWhere magnesium deficiency is severe enough to provokeconvulsions, magnesium needs to be administered byinjections or infusions. For infusion, 500 mL of a 1% solu-tion (1 gram/100 mL) of magnesium sulfate is graduallyintroduced into a vein over the course of about five hours.\nZinc deficiency and copper deficiency are quite rare,\nbut when they are detected or suspected, they can betreated by consuming zinc or copper, on a daily basis, atlevels defined by the RDA.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2192Mineral deficiencySelenium deficiency in adults can be treated by eat-\ning 100 mg selenium per day for a week, where the sele-nium is supplied as selenomethionine. The incidence ofKeshan disease in China has been reduced by supple-menting children with 1.0 mg sodium selenite per week.\nPrognosis\nIn iodine deficiency, the prognosis for treating goiter\nis excellent, however cretinism cannot be reversed. Theeffects of iron deficiency are not life-threatening and canbe easily treated. The prognosis for treating magnesiumdeficiency is excellent. The symptoms may be relievedpromptly or, at most, within two days of starting treat-ment. In cases of zinc deficiency in Iran and other partsof the Middle East, supplementation of affected youngadults with zinc has been found to promote the growth ofpubic hair and enlargement of genitalia to a normal sizewithin a few months.\nPrevention\nIn the healthy population, all mineral deficiencies\ncan be prevented by the consumption of inorganic nutri-ents at levels defined by the Recommended DietaryAllowances (RDA). Where a balanced diet is not avail-able, government programs for treating individuals, or forfortifying the food supply, may be used. Governmentsponsored programs for the prevention of iron deficiencyand iodine deficiency are widespread throughout theworld. Selenium treatment programs have been used inparts of the world where selenium deficiency exists.Attention to potassium status, and to the prevention ofpotassium deficiency, is an issue mainly in patients takingdiuretic drugs. In many cases of mineral deficiency, thedeficiency occurs because of disease, and individual med-ical attention, rather than preventative measures, is used.The prevention of calcium deficiency is generally not anissue or concern, however calcium supplements are wide-ly used with the hope of preventing osteoporosis. The pre-vention of deficiencies in magnesium, zinc, copper, man-ganese, or molybdenum are not major health issues in theUnited States. Ensuring an adequate intake of these min-erals, by eating a balanced diet or by taking mineral sup-plements, is the best way to prevent deficiencies.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrody, Tom.

    "content": "Mineral toxicity\nDefinition\nThe term mineral toxicity means a condition where\nthe concentration in the body of any one of the minerals\nis abnormally high, and where there is an adverse effecton health.\nDescription\nIn general, mineral toxicity results when there is an\naccidental consumption of too much of any mineral, aswith drinking ocean water (sodium toxicity) or with over-exposure to industrial pollutants, household chemicals, orcertain drugs. Mineral toxicity may also apply to toxicitythat can be the result of certain diseases or injuries. Forexample, hemochromatosis leads to iron toxicity; Wil-\nson’s disease results in copper toxicity; severe trauma canlead to hyperkalemia (potassium toxicity).\nThe mineral nutrients are defined as all the inorganic\nelements or inorganic molecules that are required for life.As far as human nutrition is concerned, the inorganic\nnutrients include water, sodium, potassium, chloride, cal-cium, phosphate, sulfate, magnesium, iron, copper, zinc,manganese, iodine, selenium, and molybdenum.\nThe mineral content of the body may be measured by\ntesting samples of blood plasma, red blood cells, and urine.\nCauses and symptoms\nAn increase in the concentrations of sodium in the\nbloodstream can be toxic. The normal concentration ofsodium in the blood plasma is 136-145 mM, while levelsover 152 mM can result in seizures and death . Increased\nplasma sodium, which is called hypernatremia , causes\nvarious cells of the body, including those of the brain, toshrink. Shrinkage of the brain cells results in confusion,coma ,paralysis of the lung muscles, and death. Death\nhas occurred where table salt (sodium chloride) was acci-dently used, instead of sugar, for feeding infants. Deathdue to sodium toxicity has also resulted when baking soda(sodium bicarbonate) was used during attempted therapyof excessive diarrhea or vomiting. Although a variety of\nprocessed foods contain high levels of sodium chloride,the levels used are not enough to result in sodium toxicity.\nThe normal level of potassium in the bloodstream is\nin the range of 3.5-5.0 mM, while levels of 6.3-8.0 mM\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2193Mineral toxicity(severe hyperkalemia) result in cardiac arrhythmias or\neven death due to cardiac arrest. Potassium is potentiallyquite toxic, however toxicity or death due to potassiumpoisoning is usually prevented because of the vomiting\nreflex. The consumption of food results in mild increasesin the concentration of potassium in the bloodstream, butlevels of potassium do not become toxic because of theuptake of potassium by various cells of the body, as wellas by the action of the kidneys transferring the potassiumions from the blood to the urine. The body’s regulatorymechanisms can easily be overwhelmed, however, whenpotassium chloride is injected intravenously, as highdoses of injected potassium can easily result in death.\nIodine toxicity can result from an intake of 2.0 mg of\niodide per day. The toxicity results in impairment of thecreation of thyroid hormone, resulting in lower levels ofthyroid hormone in the bloodstream. The thyroid glandenlarges, as a consequence, and goiter is produced. This\nenlargement is also called hyperthyroidism . Goiter is\nusually caused by iodine deficiency. In addition to goiter,iodine toxicity produces ulcers on the skin. This condi-tion has been called “kelp acne,” because of its associa-tion with eating kelp, an ocean plant, which containshigh levels of iodine. Iodine toxicity occurs in Japan,where large amounts of seaweed are consumed.\nIron toxicity is not uncommon, due to the wide dis-\ntribution of iron pills. A lethal dose of iron is in the rangeof 200-250 mg iron/kg body weight. Hence, a child whoaccidently eats 20 or more iron tablets may die as a resultof iron toxicity. Within six hours of ingestion, iron toxici-ty can result in vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain ,\nseizures, and possibly coma. A latent period, where thesymptoms appear to improve, may occur but it is fol-lowed by shock , low blood glucose, liver damage, con-\nvulsions, and death, occuring 12-48 hours after toxic lev-els of iron are ingested.\nNitrite poisoning should be considered along with iron\ntoxicity, since nitrite produces its toxic effect by reactingwith the iron atom of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that resides within the red blood cells.This protein is responsible for the transport of nearly all ofthe oxygen, acquired from the lungs, to various tissues andorgans of the body. Hemoglobin accounts for the red colorof our red blood cells. A very small fraction of our hemo-globin spontaneously oxidizes per day, producing a proteinof a slightly different structure, called methemoglobin.Normally, the amount of methemoglobin constitutes lessthan 1% of the total hemoglobin. Methemoglobin canaccumulate in the blood as a result of nitrite poisoning.Infants are especially susceptible to poisoning by nitrite.\nNitrate, which is naturally present in green leafy\nvegetables and in the water supply is rapidly converted tonitrite by the naturally occurring bacteria residing on our\ntongue, as well as in the intestines, and then absorbedinto the bloodstream. The amount of nitrate that is sup-plied by leafy vegetables and in drinking water is gener-ally about 100-170 mg/day. The amount of nitrite sup-plied by a typical diet is much less, that is, than 0.1 mgnitrite/day. Poisoning by nitrite, or nitrate after its con-version to nitrite, results in the inability of hemoglobin tocarry oxygen throughout the body. This condition can beseen by the blue color of the skin. Adverse symptomsoccur when over 30% of the hemoglobin has been con-verted to methemoglobin, and these symptoms includecardiac arrhythmias, headache ,nausea and vomiting ,\nand in severe cases, seizures.\nCalcium and phosphate are closely related nutrients.\nCalcium toxicity is rare, but overconsumption of calciumsupplements may lead to deposits of calcium phosphatein the soft tissues of the body. Phosphate toxicity canoccur with overuse of laxatives or enemas that contain\nphosphate. Severe phosphate toxicity can result inhypocalcemia , and in various symptoms resulting from\nlow plasma calcium levels. Moderate phosphate toxicity,occurring over a period of months, can result in thedeposit of calcium phosphate crystals in various tissuesof the body.\nZinc toxicity is rare, but it can occur in metal work-\ners who are exposed to fumes containing zinc. Excessivedietary supplements of zinc can result in nausea, vomit-ing, and diarrhea. The chronic intake of excessive zincsupplements can result in copper deficiency, as zincinhibits the absorption of copper.\nSevere alterations in copper metabolism occur in\ntwo genetic diseases, Wilson’s disease and Menkes’ dis-ease. Both of these diseases are rare and occur in aboutone in 100,000 births. Both diseases involve mutations inthe proteins that transport copper, that is, in special chan-nels that allow the passage of copper ions through cellmembranes. Wilson’s disease tends to occur in teenagersand in young adults, and then remain for the lifetime.Copper accumulates in the liver, kidney, and brain,resulting in damage to the liver and nervous system. Wil-son’s disease can be successfully controlled by lifelongtreatment with d-penicillamine. Treatment also involvesavoiding foods that are high in copper, such as liver, nuts,chocolate, and mollusks. After an initial period of treat-ment with penicillamine, Wilson’s disease may be treat-ed with zinc (150 mg oral Zn/day). The zinc inhibits theabsorption of dietary copper.\nSelenium toxicity occurs in regions of the world,\nincluding some parts of China, where soils contain highlevels of selenium. A daily intake of 0.75-5.0 mg seleni-um may occur in these regions, due to the presence of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2194Mineral toxicityselenium in foods and water. Early signs of selenium tox-\nicity include nausea, weakness, and diarrhea. With con-tinued intake of selenium, changes in fingernails and hairloss results, and damage to the nervous system occurs.The breath may acquire a garlic odor, as a result of theincreased production of dimethylselenide in the body,and its release via the lungs.\nManganese toxicity occurs in miners in manganese\nmines, where men breathe air containing dust bearingmanganese at a concentration of 5-250 mg/cubic meter.Manganese toxicity in miners has been documented inChile, India, Japan, Mexico, and elsewhere. Symptomsof manganese poisoning typically occur within severalmonths or years of exposure. These symptoms include amental disorder resembling schizophrenia , as well as\nhyperirritability, violent acts, hallucinations , and diffi-\nculty in walking.\nDiagnosis\nThe initial diagnosis of mineral toxicity involves\nquestioning the patient in order to determine any unusualaspects of the diet, unusual intake of drugs and chemicals,and possible occupational exposure. Diagnosis of mineraltoxicities also involves measuring the metal concentrationin the plasma or urine. Concentrations that are above thenormal range can confirm the initial, suspected diagnosis.\nTreatment\nIron toxicity is treated by efforts to remove remain-\ning iron from the stomach, by use of a solution of 5%sodium bicarbonate. Where plasma iron levels are above0.35 mg/dL, the patient is treated with deferoxamine.Treatment of manganese toxicity involves removal of thepatient from the high manganese environment, as well aslifelong doses of the drug L-dopa. The treatment is onlypartially successful. Treatment of nitrite or nitrate toxici-ty involves inhalation of 100% oxygen for several hours.If oxygen treatment is not effective, then methylene bluemay be injected, as a 1.0% solution, in a dose of 1.0 mgmethylene blue/kg body weight.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for treating toxicity due to sodium,\npotassium, calcium, and phosphate is usually excellent.Toxicity due to the deposit of calcium phosphate crystalsis not usually reversible. The prognosis for treatingiodine toxicity is excellent. For any mineral overdosethat causes coma or seizures, the prognosis for recoveryis often poor, and death results in a small fraction ofpatients. For any mineral toxicity that causes nerve dam-age, the prognosis is often fair to poor.Prevention\nWhen mineral toxicity results from the excessive\nconsumption of mineral supplements, toxicity can beprevented by not using supplements. In the case of man-ganese, toxicity can be prevented by avoiding work inmanganese mines. In the case of iodine, toxicity can beprevented by avoiding overconsumption of seaweed orkelp. In the case of selenium toxicity that arises due tohigh-selenium soils, toxicity can be prevented by relyingon food and water acquired from a low-selenium region.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBrody, Tom.

    "title": "Minerals",
    "content": "Minerals\nDefinition\nThe minerals (inorganic nutrients) that are relevant\nto human nutrition include water, sodium, potassium,\nchloride, calcium, phosphate, sulfate, magnesium, iron,copper, zinc, manganese, iodine, selenium, and molybde-num. Cobalt is a required mineral for human health, butit is supplied by vitamin B\n12. Cobalt appears to have no\nother function, aside from being part of this vitamin.There is some evidence that chromium, boron, and otherinorganic elements play some part in human nutrition,but the evidence is indirect and not yet convincing. Fluo-ride seems not to be required for human life, but its pres-ence in the diet contributes to long term dental health.Some of the minerals do not occur as single atoms, butoccur as molecules. These include water, phosphate, sul-fate, and selenite (a form of selenium). Sulfate containsan atom of sulfur. We do not need to eat sulfate, since thebody can acquire all the sulfate it needs from protein.\nThe statement that various minerals, or inorganic\nnutrients, are required for life means that their continuedsupply in the diet is needed for growth, maintenance of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2195Mineralsbody weight in adulthood, and for reproduction. The\namount of each mineral that is needed to support growthduring infancy and childhood, to maintain body weightand health, and to facilitate pregnancy and lactation ,a r e\nlisted in a table called the Recommended DietaryAllowances (RDA). This table was compiled by the Foodand Nutrition Board, a committee that serves the UnitedStates government. All of the values listed in the RDAindicate the daily amounts that are expected to maintainhealth throughout most of the general population. Theactual levels of each inorganic nutrient required by anygiven individual is likely to be less than that stated by theRDA. The RDAs are all based on studies that providedthe exact, minimal requirement of each mineral neededto maintain health. However, the RDA values are actuallygreater than the minimal requirement, as determined bystudies on small groups of healthy human subjects, inorder to accomodate the variability expected among thegeneral population.\nThe RDAs for adult males are 800 mg of calcium,\n800 mg of phosphorus, 350 mg of magnesium, 10 mg ofiron, 15 mg of zinc, 0.15 mg of iodine, and 0.07 mg ofselenium. The RDA for sodium is expressed as a range(0.5-2.4 g/day). The minimal requirement for chloride isabout 0.75 g/day, and the minimal requirement for potas-sium is 1.6-2.0 g/day, though RDA values have not beenset for these nutrients. The RDAs for several other miner-als has not been determined, and here the estimated safeand adequate daily dietary intake has been listed by theFood and Nutrition Board. These values are listed forcopper (1.5-3.0 mg), manganese (2-5 mg), fluoride (1.5-4.0 mg), molybdenum (0.075-0.25 mg), and chromium(0.05-0.2 mg). In noting the appearance of chromium inthis list, one should note that the function of chromium isessentially unknown, and evidence for its necessity existsonly for animals, and not for human beings. In consider-ing the amount of any mineral used for treating mineral\ndeficiency , one should compare the recommended level\nwith the RDA for that mineral. Treatment at a level thatis one tenth of the RDA might not be expected to be ade-quate, while treatment at levels ranging from 10-1,000times the RDA might be expected to exert a toxic effect,depending on the mineral. In this way, one can judgewhether any claim of action, for a specific mineral treat-ment, is likely to be adequate or appropriate.\nPurpose\nPeople are treated with minerals for several reasons.\nThe primary reason is to relieve a mineral deficiency,when a deficiency has been detected. Chemical tests suit-able for the detection of all mineral deficiencies areavailable. The diagnosis of the deficiency is often aidedby tests that do not involve chemical reactions, such asthe hematocrit test for the red blood cell content in\nblood for iron deficiency, the visual examination of theneck for iodine deficiency, or the examination of bonesby densitometry for calcium deficiency. Mineral treat-ment is conducted after a test and diagnosis for iron-defi-ciency anemia, in the case of iron, and after a test anddiagnosis for hypomagnesemia, in the case of magne-sium, to give two examples.\nA second general reason for mineral treatment is to\nprevent the development of a possible or expected defi-ciency. Here, minerals are administered when tests forpossible mineral deficiency are not given. Examplesinclude the practice of giving young infants iron supple-ments, and of the food industry’s practice of supplement-ing infant formulas with iron. The purpose here is toreduce the risk for iron deficiency anemia . Another\nexample is the practice of many women of taking calci-um supplements, with the hope of reducing the risk ofosteoporosis .\nMost minerals are commercially available at super-\nmarkets, drug stores, and specialty stores. There is reasonto believe that the purchase and consumption of most ofthese minerals is beneficial to health for some, but not all,of the minerals. Potassium supplements are useful forreducing blood pressure, in cases of persons with highblood pressure. The effect of potassium varies from per-son to person. The consumption of calcium supplementsis likely to have some effect on reducing the risk forosteoporosis. The consumption of selenium supplementsis expected to be of value only for residents of KeshanProvince, China, because of the established association ofselenium deficiency in this region with “Keshan disease.”\nPrecautions\nDuring emergency treatment of sodium deficiency\n(hyponatremia ), potassium deficiency ( hypokalemia ),\nand calcium deficiency ( hypocalcemia ) with intravenous\ninjections, extreme caution must be taken to avoid pro-ducing toxic levels of each of these minerals ( hyperna-\ntremia ,hyperkalemia , and hypercalcemia ), as mineral\ntoxicity can be life-threatening in some instances. The\nlatter three conditions can be life threatening. Seleniumis distinguished among most of the nutrients in thatdietary intakes at levels only ten times that of the RDAcan be toxic. Hence, one must guard against any over-dose of selenium. Calcium and zinc supplements, whentaken orally, are distinguished among most of the otherminerals in that their toxicity is relatively uncommon.\nDescription\nMinerals are used in treatments by three methods,\nnamely, by replacing a poor diet with a diet that supplies\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2196Mineralsthe RDA, by consuming oral supplements, or by injec-\ntions or infusions. Injections are especially useful forinfants, for mentally disabled persons, or where thephysician wants to be totally sure of compliance. Infu-sions, as well as injections, are essential for medicalemergencies, as during mineral deficiency situations likehyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypo-magnesemia. Oral mineral supplements are especiallyuseful for mentally alert persons who otherwise cannotor will not consume food that is a good mineral source,such as meat. For example, a vegetarian who will notconsume meat may be encouraged to consume oral sup-plements of iron, as well as supplements of vitamin B\n12.\nIron treatment is used for young infants, given as\nsupplements of 7 mg of iron per day to prevent anemia.Iron is also supplied to infants via the food industry’spractice of including iron at 12 mg/L in cow milk-basedinfant formulas, as well as adding powdered iron at lev-els of 50 mg iron per 100 g dry infant cereal.\nCalcium supplements, along with estrogen and calci-\ntonin therapy, are commonly used in the prevention andtreatment of osteoporosis. Estrogen and calcitonin are nat-urally occurring hormones. Bone loss occurs with diets\nsupplying under 400 mg Ca/day. Bone loss can be mini-mized with the consumption of the RDA for calcium.There is some thought that all postmenopausal womenshould consume 1,000–1,500 mg of calcium per day.These levels are higher than the RDA. There is some evi-dence that such supplementation can reduce bone losses insome bones, such as the elbow (ulna), but not in otherbones. Calcium absorption by the intestines decreaseswith aging , especially after the age of 70. The regulatory\nmechanisms of the intestines that allow absorption of ade-quate calcium (500 mg Ca/day or less) may be impaired inthe elderly. Because of these changes, there is much inter-est in increasing the RDA for calcium for older women.\nFluoride has been proven to reduce the rate of tooth\ndecay . When fluoride occurs in the diet, it is incorporated\ninto the structure of the teeth, and other bones. The opti-mal range of fluoride in drinking water is 0.7-1.2 mg/L.This level results in a reduction in the rate of tooth decayby about 50%. The American Dental Association recom-mends that persons living in areas lacking fluoridatedwater take fluoride supplements. The recommendation is0.25 mg F/day from the ages of 0-2 years, 0.5 mg F/dayfor 2-3 years, and 1.0 mg F/day for ages 3-13 years.\nMagnesium is often used to treat a dangerous condi-\ntion, called eclampsia, that occasionally occurs duringpregnancy. In this case, magnesium is used as a drug, andnot to relieve a deficiency. High blood pressure is a fairlycommon disorder during pregnancy, affecting 1-5% ofpregnant mothers. Hypertension during pregnancy canresult in increased release of protein in the urine. In preg-\nnancy, the combination of hypertension with increasedurinary protein is called preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is aconcern during pregnancies as it may lead to eclampsia.Eclampsia involves convulsions and possibly death to\nthe mother. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice forpreventing the convulsions of eclampsia.\nTreatment with cobalt, in the form of vitamin B\n12,i s\nused for relieving the symptoms of pernicious anemia .\nPernicious anemia is a relatively common disease thattends to occur in persons older than 40 years. Free cobaltis never used for the treatment of any disease.\nPreparation\nEvaluation of a patient’s mineral levels requires a\nblood sample, and the preparation of plasma or serumfrom the blood sample. An overnight fast is usually recom-mended as preparation prior to drawing the blood andchemical analysis. The reason for this is that any mineralpresent in the food consumed at breakfast may artificiallyboost the plasma mineral content beyond the normal fast-\ninglevel, and thereby mask a mineral deficiency. In some\ncases, red blood cells are used for the mineral status assay.\nAftercare\nThe healthcare provider assesses the patient’s\nresponse to mineral treatment. A positive response con-firms that the diagnosis was correct. Lack of responseindicates that the diagnosis was incorrect, that the patienthad failed to take the mineral supplement, or that a higherdose of mineral was needed. The response to mineral treat-ment can be monitored by chemical tests, by an examina-tion of red blood cells or white blood cells, or by physio-logical tests, depending on the exact mineral deficiency.\nRisks\nThere are few risks associated with mineral treat-\nment. In treating emergency cases of hyponatremia,hypokalemia, or hypocalcemia by intravenous injections,there exists a very real risk that giving too much sodium,potassium, or calcium, can result in hypernatremia,hyperkalemia, or hypercalcemia, respectively. Risk fortoxicity is rare where treatment is by dietary means. Thisis because the intestines act as a barrier, and absorption ofany mineral supplement is gradual. The gradual passageof any mineral through the intestines, especially when themineral supplement is taken with food, allows the variousorgans of the body to acquire the mineral. Gradual pas-sage of the mineral into the bloodstream also allows thekidneys to excrete the mineral in the urine, should levelsof the mineral rise to toxic levels in the blood.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2197MineralsResources\nBOOKS\nBrody, Tom.

It is also\nfrequently administered as part of a neuropsychologicaltest battery to evaluate cognitive functioning.\nPrecautions\nThe MMPI should be administered, scored, and\ninterpreted by a clinical professional trained in its use,preferably a psychologist or psychiatrist. The MMPI isonly one element of psychological assessment, andshould never be used alone as the sole basis for a diagno-sis. A detailed history of the test subject and a review ofpsychological, medical, educational, or other relevantrecords are required to lay the groundwork for interpret-ing the results of any psychological measurement.\nCultural and language differences in the test subject\nmay affect test performance and may result in inaccurateMMPI results. The test administrator should be informedbefore psychological testing begins if the test taker is notfluent in English and/or has a unique cultural back-ground.\nDescription\nThe original MMPI was developed at the University\nof Minnesota and introduced in 1942. The current stan-dardized version for adults 18 and over, the MMPI-2,was released in 1989, with a subsequent revision of cer-tain test elements in early 2001. The MMPI-2 has 567items, or questions, and takes approximately 60 to 90minutes to complete. There is a short form of the test thatis comprised of the first 370 items on the long-formMMPI-2. There is also a version of the inventory for ado-lescents age 14 to 18, the MMPI-A.\nThe questions asked on the MMPI are designed to\nevaluate the thoughts, emotions, attitudes, and behavioraltraits that comprise personality. The results of the testreflect an individual’s personality strengths and weak-nesses, and may identify certain disturbances of person-ality (psychopathologies) or mental deficits caused byneurological problems.\nThere are six validity scales and ten basic clinical\nor personality scales scored in the MMPI-2, and a num-ber of supplementary scales and subscales that may beused with the test. The validity scales are used to deter-mine whether the test results are actually valid (i.e., ifthe test-taker was truthful, answered cooperatively andnot randomly) and to assess the test-taker’s responsestyle (i.e., cooperative, defensive). Each clinical scaleuses a set or subset of MMPI-2 questions to evaluate aspecific personality trait. The MMPI should always beadministered in a controlled environment by a psychol-ogist or other qualified mental health professionaltrained in its use.\nPreparation\nThe administrator should provide the test subject\nwith information on the nature of the test and its intendeduse, complete standardized instructions to taking theMMPI (including any time limits, and information on theconfidentiality of the results).\nNormal results\nThe MMPI should be scored and interpreted by a\ntrained professional. When interpreting test results fortest subjects, the test administrator will review what thetest evaluates, its precision in evaluation and any marginsof error involved in scoring, and what the individualscores mean in the context of overall norms for the testand the background of the test subject.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGraham, John R.

    "content": "Minority health\nDefinition\nMinority health addresses the special medical and/or\nhealth needs associated with specific ethnic groups.\nDescription\nThe United States, as well as many other countries,\nexperiences cultural diversity. This poses specific healthissues that are specific to ethnic groups. Additionally, thepropensity for certain diseases or illnesses is of concernin certain minority groups. These specific health issuesinclude infant mortality rates, cancer , cardiovascular dis-\nease, diabetes, HIV infection, and immunizations.KEY TERMS\nNeuropsychological testing —Tests used to evalu-\nate patients who have experienced a traumaticbrain injury, brain damage, or organic neurologi-cal problems (e.g., dementia). It may also be usedto evaluate the progress of a patient who hasundergone treatment or rehabilitation for a neuro-logical injury or illness.\nNorms —Normative or mean score for a particular\nage group.\nPsychopathology —A mental disorder or illness,\nsuch as schizophrenia, personality disorder, ormajor depressive disorder.\nStandardization —The process of determining\nestablished norms and procedures for a test to actas a standard reference point for future test results.Infant mortality rates\nInfant mortality rates (IMRs) in the United States\nand in all countries worldwide are an accurate indicatorof health status. They provide information concerningprograms about pregnancy education and counseling,\ntechnological advances, and procedures and aftercare.IMRs vary among racial groups. African Americans hadan IMRs of 14.2 per 1,000 live births in 1996, approxi-mately 2.5 times higher than Caucasians. The IMRsamong American Native Indian groups varies greatly,with some communities possessing IMRs about twotimes more than national rates. Additionally HispanicIMRs (7.6 per 1,000 live births) are also diverse for sepa-rate groups, since the IMRs, for example, among PuertoRicans is higher (8.9 per 1,000 live births).\nCancer\nCancer is a serious national, worldwide, and minori-\nty health concern. It is the second cause of death in the\nUnited States, claiming over half a million lives eachyear. Approximately 50% of persons who develop cancerwill die. There is great disparity among the cancer ratesin minority groups. Across genders, cancer death ratesfor African Americans are 35% higher when compared tostatistics for Caucasians. The death rates for prostate\ncancer (two times more) and lung cancer (27 times\nmore) are disproportionately higher when compared toCaucasians. There are also gender differences amongethnic groups and specific cancers. Lung cancers inAfrican American and Hawaiian men are elevated com-pared with caucasian males. Vietnamese females wholive in the United States have five times more new casesof cervical cancer when compared to Caucasian women.\nHispanic females also have a greater incidence of cervi-cal cancer than Caucasian females. Additionally, Alaskannative men and women have a greater propensity for can-cers in the rectum and colon than do Caucasians.\nCardiovascular disease\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of dis-\nability and death rates, about equal to death from all other\ndiseases combined. Cardiovascular disease can affect thepatient’s lifestyle and function in addition to having animpact on family members. The financial costs are veryhigh. Among ethnic and racial groups cardiovascular dis-ease is the leading cause of death. Stroke is the leading\ncause of cardiovascular related death, which occurs inhigher numbers for Asian-American males when com-pared to Caucasian men. Mexican-American men andwomen and African American males have a higher inci-dence of hypertension . African American women have\nhigher rates of being overweight, which is a major riskfactor of cardiovascular disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2199Minority healthDiabetes\nDiabetes—a serious health problem in Americans\nand ethnic groups—is the seventh leading cause of deathin the United States. The prevalence of diabetes inAfrican Americans is about 70% higher than Caucasians.\nHIV\nHIV infection/AIDS is the most common cause of\ndeath for all persons age 25 to 44 years old. Ethnicgroups account for 25% of the United States populationand 54% of all AIDS cases. In addition to sexual trans-\nmission there is an increase in HIV among ethnic groupsrelated to intravenous drug usage.\nImmunizations\nImmunization, the reduction of preventable disease\nby vaccination , was lower in 1996, but there has been a\nrapid increase in African Americans taking vaccinations.The coverage for immunization among African Ameri-cans and Hispanics for persons age 65 and over is cur-rently below the general population. This may increasethe death rates due to respiratory infections.DR. ANTONIA NOVELLO (1944– )\nCauses and symptoms\nIMRs are correlated with prenatal care. Women who\nreceive adequate prenatal care tend to have better preg-nancy outcomes when compared to little or no care.Women who receive inadequate prenatal care also haveincreased chances of delivering a very low birth weight(VLBW) infant, which is linked to risk of early death.\nCancer is related to several preventable lifestyle\nchoices. Tobacco use, diet, and exposure to sun (skincancer) can be prevented by lifestyle modifications.Additionally many cancers can occur due to lack of inter-est and/or lack of availability for screening and educa-tional programs.\nCardiovascular diseases are higher among persons\nwith high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure.Certain lifestyle choices may increase the chance forheart disease includes lack of exercise , overweight, and\ncigarette smoking . Cardiovascular disease is responsible\nfor over 50% of the deaths in persons with diabetes.\nHIV occurs at a higher frequency among homosex-\nuals (the number of African Americans males who haveAIDS through sex with men has increased). Additional-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2200Minority health\nBorn Antonia Coello was born in Fajardo, Puerto\nRico, on August 23, 1944, the oldest of three children. Ateight years old, she suffered two blows that she would\ncarry all of her life. Her father, Antonio Coello, died, leav-ing her mother, Ana Delia Flores Coello, to raise her chil-dren alone until she later remarried Ramon Flores, anelectrician. Novello was also diagnosed with a chroniccondition called congenital megacolon, an illness inwhich her colon was overly large and not functioningproperly, which required regular hospitalization.Although an operation would have helped Novello, itwas not performed until she was 18 years old, and evenafter the surgery, complications followed her for years.Because of her childhood illness, Novello grew up wanti-ng to be a doctor.\nOn October 17, 1989, President George Bush officially\nnominated Novello for Surgeon General. The fourteenthUnited States Surgeon General, Novello was sworn in onMarch 9, 1990. She remarked that “the American dream iswell and alive...today the West Side Story comes to the WestWing.” Novello was the first woman and the first Hispanicto be appointed Surgeon General of the United States.Noted for her philosophy of “good science, good sense”and for her approachability, Novello was dedicated to theprevention of AIDS, substance abuse, and smoking, as wellas to the education of the American public. Her specialconcerns were for women, children, and Hispanics—popu-lations often overlooked by public health services.\n(Gamma Liaison. Reproduced by permission.)ly, unprotected sexual intercourse and sharing used nee-\ndles for IV drug injection are strongly correlated withinfection.\nVaccinations are an effective method of preventing\ncertain disease such as polio ,tetanus , pertussis, diph-\ntheria ,influenza ,hepatitis b , and pneumococcal infec-\ntions. Approximately 90% of influenza related mortalityis associated with persons aged 65 and older. This ismostly due to neglect of vaccinations. About 45,000adults each year die of diseases related to hepatitis B,pneumococcal, and influenza infections.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of VLBW is by weight. Infants who\nweigh 1,500 g are at high risk for death. For cancer, thediagnosis can be made through screening proceduressuch as mammography (for breast cancer ), PAP smear\n(for cervical cancer), and lifestyle modifications such asavoidance of sun and cigarette smoking. Balanced diets\nand adequate nutrition also help. Other specific screen-\ning tests (PSA, prostate surface antigen) are helpful fordiagnosing prostate cancer. Cardiovascular diseases canbe detected by medical check-up. Blood pressure andcholesterol levels can be measured. Obesity can be\ndiagnosed by assessing a person’s weight relative toheight. Diabetes and its complications can be detectedby blood tests, in-depth eye examinations and studiesthat assess the flow of blood through blood vessels inlegs. HIV can be detected through a careful history/physical examination and analysis of blood using a spe-cial test called a western blot. Infections caused by lackof immunizations can be detected by careful physical\nexamination and culturing the specific microorganism\nin the laboratory.\nTreatment\nTreatment is directed at the primary causes(s) that\nminorities have increased chances of developing dis-ease(s). Cancer may require treatment utilizing surgery,radiotherapy, or chemotherapy . Cardiovascular dis-\neases may require surgical procedures for establishing adiagnosis and initiating treatment. Depending on theextent of disease, cardiovascular management canbecome complicated requiring medications and dailylifestyle modifications. Treatment usually includesmedications, dietary modifications, and—if complica-tions arise—specific interventions tailored to alleviat-ing the problem. HIV can be treated with specific med-ications and more often than not with symptomatictreatment as reported complications arise.

    "title": "Minoxidil",
    "content": "Minoxidil\nDefinition\nMinoxidil is a drug available in two forms to treat\ndifferent conditions. Oral minoxidil is used to treat highblood pressure and the topical solution form is used totreat hair loss and baldness.\nPurpose\nMinoxidil was the first drug approved by the FDA\nfor the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (hair loss).\nBefore that, minoxidil had been used as a vasodilatordrug prescribed as oral tablet to treat high blood pres-sure, with side effects that included hair growth andreversal of male baldness. In the 1980s, UpJohn Corpo-ration came out with a topical solution of 2% minoxidil,called Rogaine, for the specific treatment of androgeneticalopecia. Since the 1990s, numerous generic forms ofminoxidil have become available to treat hair loss whilethe oral form is still used to treat high blood pressure.\nThe popularity of hair loss treatment is due to the\ngeneral preference in the overall population for the cos-metic appearance of a full head of hair. Minoxidil is usedto stimulate hair growth in areas of the scalp that havestopped growing hair. As of early 2001, the exact mecha-nism of action of minoxidil is not known.\nPrecautions\nPeople who have had a prior unusual or allergic\nreaction to either minoxidil or propylene glycol, a non-active chemical in the Rogaine solution, should not usetopical minoxidil. People who have had a previous aller-gic reaction to preservatives or dyes may also be at riskfor having an allergic reaction to minoxidil.\nPeople who are using cortisone, or cortisone-like\ndrugs ( corticosteroids ), petroleum jelly (Vaseline), or\ntretinoin (Retin-A) on their scalps should consult theirdoctors prior to using minoxidil. The use of any of theseproducts in conjunction with minoxidil may cause exces-sive minoxidil absorption into the body and increase therisk of side effects.\nAlso, people who have skin problems or irritations\nof the scalp, including sunburn , may absorb too much\nminoxidil and increase their risk of side effects.\nAs for oral minoxidil, the form prescribed for high\nblood pressure, patients should use minoxidil only undermedical supervision to ensure that excessive amounts ofthe drug are not absorbed into their bodies. Largeamounts of minoxidil may increase the severity of thesymptoms and side effects of hypertension .\nMinoxidil may pass from mother to child through\nbreast milk. Therefore, women who are breastfeedingshould not use minoxidil.\nDescription\nFor the treatment of hair loss, minoxidil is available\nas a topical solution that is generally either 2% or 5%minoxidil in propylene glycol. The propylene glycolensures that the applied minoxidil is evenly spread acrossthe affected area and easily absorbed through the skin. Asof early 2001, the 5% solution is only approved by theFDA for use on men. Approximately 1 milliliter ofminoxidil solution is applied to the scalp once a dayusing the fingertips or a pump spray. It should be appliedfrom the center of the area being treated outward.\nIn the treatment of high blood pressure, oral minoxi-\ndil is usually prescribed when other medications havefailed to treat the condition. Dosage is usually 2.5-100mg per day as a single dose for adults and 200 micro-grams to 1 mg per kg of body weight for children.\nPreparation\nBefore using topical minoxidil, the hair and scalp\nshould be clean and dry before the minoxidil solution isapplied.\nAftercare\nHands, and any other areas of the body where hair\ngrowth is not desired that may have come into contactwith topical minoxidil, should be washed immediatelyafter applying the minoxidil solution on the scalp. Onceapplied, topical minoxidil should be allowed to air-dryfor at least two to four hours before clothing is pulled onor off over the head, a hat is worn, or the patient goes tobed. Prior to this, the minoxidil solution may stain cloth-ing, hats, or bed linens; or, it may be accidentally trans-ferred from the patient’s head to one of these objects,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2202Minoxidilthen back to other parts of the patient’s body where hair\ngrowth is not desired. A blow dryer, or other dryingmethods, should not be used to speed the drying of theminoxidil as this may interfere with the absorption of themedicine. People using minoxidil should also not sham-poo, wash, or rinse their hair for at least four hours afterminoxidil is applied.\nRisks\nThe most common side effects of topical minoxidil\nuse are itching and skin irritation of the treated area of\nthe scalp. Unwanted hair growth may also occur adjacentto treated areas or in areas where the medicine has beeninadvertently transferred several times. This unwantedhair growth adjacent to the treatment area may be partic-ularly distressing to women when the face is involved.The itching and irritation usually subside after the drughas been used for approximately two weeks. If symp-toms persist after this time, minoxidil use should be halt-ed until a physician has been consulted.\nExtremely rare side effects that may occur if too\nmuch topically or orally administered minoxidil is beingabsorbed in the body include:\n• changes in vision, most commonly blurred vision• chest pain• very low blood pressure• decreased sexual desire• fast or irregular heartbeat• flushing of the skin• headache• lightheadedness• numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or face• partial, or complete, impotence• rapid weight gain• swelling of the hands, feet, lower legs, or face\nNormal results\nTopical minoxidil is much more effective at treating\nbaldness that occurs on the top, or crown, of the headthan it is at causing hair growth on other parts of thehead. Minoxidil does not work for everyone and there isno predictor, in early 2001, of whether or not it will beeffective in any particular person. Clinical tests on theeffectiveness of topical minoxidil in men with baldnesson the top of the head showed that 48% of men who hadused minoxidil for one year reported moderate to densere-growth of hair within the treated area.

For some patients, this is the extent tothe effectiveness of this medication. For others, thisdown-like hair develops into hair of the same color andthickness as the other hairs on their heads.\nMinoxidil is a treatment for hair loss, it is not a cure.\nOnce a patient stops taking minoxidil, he or she willmost likely lose all of the re-grown hair within 90 days ofstopping the medication and no further hair growth willoccur.\nResources\nBOOKS\nSaito, H.

    "title": "Miscarriage",
    "content": "Miscarriage\nDefinition\nMiscarriage means loss of an embryo or fetus before\nthe 20th week of pregnancy . Most miscarriages occur\nduring the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The medical termfor miscarriage is spontaneous abortion.\nDescription\nMiscarriages are very common. Approximately 20%\nof pregnancies (one in five) end in miscarriage. The mostcommon cause is a genetic abnormality of the fetus. Notall women realize that they are miscarrying and othersmay not seek medical care when it occurs.\nA miscarriage is often a traumatic event for both part-\nners, and can cause feelings similar to the loss of a child orother member of the family. Fortunately, 90% of womenwho have had one miscarriage subsequently have a normalpregnancy and healthy baby; 60% are able to have a healthybaby after two miscarriages. Even a woman who has hadthree miscarriages in a row still has more than a 50% chanceof having a successful pregnancy the fourth time.\nCauses and symptoms\nThere are many reasons why a woman’s pregnancy\nends in miscarriage. Often the cause is not clear. Howev-er, more than half the miscarriages that occur in the firsteight weeks of pregnancy involve serious chromosomalabnormalities or birth defects that would make it impos-\nsible for the baby to survive. These are different frominherited genetic diseases. They probably occur duringdevelopment of the specific egg or sperm, and thereforeare not likely to occur again.\nIn about 17% of cases, miscarriage is caused by an\nabnormal hormonal imbalance that interferes with the abil-ity of the uterus to support the growing embryo. This isknown as luteal phase defect. In another 10% of cases,there is a problem with the structure of the uterus or cervix.This can especially occur in women whose mothers useddiethylstilbestrol (DES) when pregnant with them.\nThe risk of miscarriage is increased by:\n•smoking (up to a 50% increased risk)\n• infection• exposure to toxins (such as arsenic, lead, formaldehyde,\nbenzene, and ethylene oxide)\n• multiple pregnancies\n• poorly-controlled diabetes\nThe most common symptom of miscarriage is bleed-\ning from the vagina, which may be light or heavy. How-ever, bleeding during early pregnancy is common and isnot always serious. Many women have slight vaginalbleeding after the egg implants in the uterus (about 7-10days after conception), which can be mistaken for athreatened miscarriage. A few women bleed at the timeof their monthly periods through the pregnancy. Howev-er, any bleeding in the first three months of pregnancy(first trimester) is considered a threat of miscarriage.\nWomen should not ignore vaginal bleeding during\nearly pregnancy. In addition to signaling a threatenedmiscarriage, it could also indicate a potentially life-threatening condition known as ectopic pregnancy . In\nan ectopic pregnancy, the fetus implants at a site otherthan the inside of the uterus. Most often this occurs in thefallopian tube.\nCramping is another common sign of a possible mis-\ncarriage. The cramping occurs because the uterusattempts to push out the pregnancy tissue. If a pregnantwoman experiences both bleeding and cramping the pos-sibility of miscarriage is more likely than if only one ofthese symptoms is present.\nIf a woman experiences any sign of impending mis-\ncarriage, she should be examined by a practitioner. Thedoctor or nurse will perform a pelvic exam to check if\nthe cervix is closed as it should be. If the cervix is open,miscarriage is inevitable and nothing can preserve thepregnancy. Symptoms of an inevitable miscarriage mayinclude dull relentless or sharp intermittent pain in the\nlower abdomen or back. Bleeding may be heavy. Clottedmaterial and tissue (the placenta and embryo) may passfrom the vagina.\nA situation in which only some of the products in\nthe uterus have been expelled is called an incompletemiscarriage. Pain and bleeding may continue andbecome severe. An incomplete miscarriage requires med-ical attention.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2204MiscarriageA “missed abortion” occurs when the fetus has died\nbut neither the fetus nor placenta is expelled. There maynot be any bleeding or pain, but the symptoms of preg-nancy will disappear. The physician may suspect amissed abortion if the uterus does not continue to grow.The physician will diagnose a missed abortion with anultrasound examination.\nA woman should contact her doctor if she experi-\nences any of the following:\n• any bleeding during pregnancy• pain or cramps during pregnancy• passing of tissue• fever and chills during or after miscarriage\nDiagnosis\nIf a woman experiences any sign of impending mis-\ncarriage she should see a doctor or nurse for a pelvicexamination to check if the cervix is closed, as it shouldbe. If the cervix is open, miscarriage is inevitable.\nAn ultrasound examination can confirm a missed\nabortion if the uterus has shrunk and the patient has hadcontinual spotting with no other symptoms.\nTreatment\nThreatened miscarriage\nFor women who experience bleeding and cramping,\nbed rest is often ordered until symptoms disappear.Women should not have sex until the outcome of thethreatened miscarriage is determined. If bleeding andcramping are severe, women should drink fluids only.\nMiscarriage\nAlthough it may be psychologically difficult, if a\nwoman has a miscarriage at home she should try to col-lect any material she passes in a clean container foranalysis in a laboratory. This may help determine whythe miscarriage occurred.\nAn incomplete miscarriage or missed abortion may\nrequire the removal of the fetus and placenta by a D&C(dilatation and curettage ). In this procedure the con-\ntents of the uterus are scraped out. It is performed in thedoctor’s office or hospital.\nAfter miscarriage, a doctor may prescribe rest or\nantibiotics for infection. There will be some bleeding from\nthe vagina for several days to two weeks after miscarriage.To give the cervix time to close and avoid possible infec-tion, women should not use tampons or have sex for at leasttwo weeks. Couples should wait for one to three normalmenstrual cycles before trying to get pregnant again.Prognosis\nA miscarriage that is properly treated is not life-\nthreatening, and usually does not affect a woman’s abili-ty to deliver a healthy baby in the future.\nFeelings of grief and loss after a miscarriage are\ncommon. In fact, some women who experience a miscar-riage suffer from major depression during the six monthsafter the loss. This is especially true for women whodon’t have any children or who have had depression inthe past. The emotional crisis can be similar to that of awoman whose baby has died after birth.\nPrevention\nThe majority of miscarriages cannot be prevented\nbecause they are caused by severe genetic problems deter-mined at conception. Some doctors advise women whohave a threatened miscarriage to rest in bed for a day andavoid sex for a few weeks after the bleeding stops. Otherexperts believe that a healthy woman (especially early inthe pregnancy) should continue normal activities insteadof protecting a pregnancy that may end in miscarriagelater on, causing even more profound distress.\nIf miscarriage was caused by a hormonal imbalance\n(luteal phase defect), this can be treated with a hormonecalled progesterone to help prevent subsequent miscar-riages. If structural problems have led to repeated miscar-riage, there are some possible procedures to treat theseproblems. Other possible ways to prevent miscarriage areto treat genital infections, eat a well-balanced diet, andrefrain from smoking and using recreational drugs.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAllen, Marie, and Shelly Marks.

    "content": "Mitral valve insufficiency\nDefinition\nMitral valve insufficiency is a term used when the\nvalve between the upper left chamber of the heart (atrium)and the lower left chamber (ventricle) doesn’t close wellenough to prevent back flow of blood when the ventriclecontracts. Mitral valve insufficiency is also known asmitral valve regurgitation or mitral valve incompetence.KEY TERMS\nDiethylstilbestrol (DES) —This is a synthetic estro-\ngen drug that is used to treat a number of hormon-al conditions. However, it causes problems indeveloping fetuses and should not be taken duringpregnancy. From about 1938 to 1971, DES wasgiven to pregnant women because it was thoughtto prevent miscarriage. Children of women whotook the drug during pregnancy are at risk for cer-tain health problems.\nDilation and curettage (D&C) —A procedure in\nwhich the neck of the womb (cervix) is expandedand the lining of the uterus is scraped to removepregnancy tissue or abnormal tissue.\nEmbryo —An unborn child in the first eight weeks\nafter conception. After the eighth week until birth,the baby is called a fetus.Description\nNormally, blood enters the left atrium of the heart\nfrom the lungs and is pumped through the mitral valveinto the left ventricle. The left ventricle contracts topump the blood forward into the aorta. The aorta is alarge artery that sends oxygenated blood through the cir-culatory system to all of the tissues in the body. If themitral valve is leaky due to mitral valve insufficiency, itallows some blood to get pushed back into the atrium.This extra blood creates an increase in pressure in theatrium, which then increases blood pressure in the ves-sels that bring the blood from the lungs to the heart.Increased pressure in these vessels can result in increasedfluid buildup in the lungs.\nCauses and symptoms\nIn the past, rheumatic fever was the most common\ncause of mitral valve insufficiency. However, theincreased use of antibiotics for strep throat has made\nrheumatic fever rare in developed countries. In these\ncountries, mitral valve insufficiency caused by rheumaticfever is seen mostly in the elderly. In countries with lessdeveloped health care, rheumatic fever is still commonand is often a cause of mitral valve insufficiency.\nHeart attacks that damage the structures that support\nthe mitral valve are a common cause of mitral valveinsufficiency. Myxomatous degeneration can cause a“floppy” mitral valve that leaks. In other cases, the valvesimply deteriorates with age and becomes less efficient.\nPeople with mitral valve insufficiency may not have\nany symptoms at all. It is often discovered during a doc-tor’s visit when the doctor listens to the heart sounds.\nBoth the left atrium and left ventricle tend to get a\nlittle bigger when the mitral valve does not work proper-ly. The ventricle has to pump more blood so it gets biggerto increase the force of each beat. The atrium gets biggerto hold the extra blood. An enlarged ventricle can causepalpitations . An enlarged atrium can develop an erratic\nrhythm (atrial fibrillation), which reduces its efficiencyand can lead to blood clots forming in the atrium.\nDiagnosis\nWhen the doctor listens to the heart sounds, mitral\nvalve insufficiency is generally recognized by the soundthe blood makes as it leaks backward. It sounds like aregurgitant murmur. The next step is generally a chest x\nrayand an electrocardiogram (ECG) to see if the heart is\nenlarged. The most definitive noninvasive test isechocardiography , a test that uses sound waves to make\nan image of the heart. This test gives a picture of thevalve in action and shows the severity of the problem.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2206Mitral valve insufficiencyTreatment\nA severely impaired valve needs to be repaired or\nreplaced. Either option will require surgery. Repairing thevalve can fix the problem completely or reduce it enoughto make it bearable and prevent damage to the heart.Valves can be replaced with either a mechanical valve orone that is partly mechanical and partly from a pig’s heart.\nMechanical valves are effective but can increase the\nincidence of blood clots. To prevent blood clots fromforming, the patient will need to take drugs that preventabnormal blood clotting (anticoagulants). The valvesmade partly from a pigs heart don’t have as great a riskof blood clots but don’t last as long as fully mechanicalvalves. If a valve wears out, it must be replaced again.\nDamaged heart valves are easily infected. Anytime a\nprocedure is contemplated that might allow infectiousorganisms to enter the blood, the person with mitralvalve insufficiency should take antibiotics to preventpossible infection.\nPrognosis\nThe diagnostic, medical and surgical procedures\navailable to the person with mitral valve insufficiency areall likely to produce good results.\nPrevention\nThe only possible way to prevent mitral valve insuf-\nficiency is to prevent rheumatic fever. This can be doneby evaluating sore throats for the presence of the bacteriathat causes strep throat. Strep throat is easily treated withantibiotics.\nResources\nBOOKS\nMcGoon, Michael D., Mayo Clinic Heart Book: The Ultimate\nGuide to Heart Health.

    "content": "Mitral valve prolapse\nDefinition\nMitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a ballooning of the\nsupport structures of the mitral heart valve into the leftupper collection chamber of the heart.\nDescription\nOther names for MVP include floppy valve and Bar-\nlow’s syndrome. The mitral valve is located on the leftside of the heart between the top chamber (left atrium)and the bottom chamber (left ventricle). The valve opensand closes according to the heartbeat and the pressurethat is exerted upon it from the blood in both chambers.\nThe valve has supporting structures that attach to the\nheart muscle to help it open and close properly. Whenthese structures weaken or lengthen abnormally, thevalve may balloon into the left atrium. Sometimes thiscan cause the mitral valve to leak blood backward.\nThis condition may be inherited and occurs in\napproximately 10% of the population. It affects morewomen than men and often peaks after the age of 40.\nCauses and symptoms\nMVP may occur due to rheumatic heart disease but\nis usually found in healthy people. Changes that occur inthe valve are caused by rapid multiplication of cells inthe middle layer that presses on the outer layer. The outerlayer weakens, causing a prolapse of the valve toward theleft atrium.\nMost persons do not have symptoms. Those that do\nmay experience sharp, left-sided chest pain . Some com-\nplain of fatigue , or a pounding feeling in the chest. Others\ncan have an irregular heart beat and even pass out. Somepersons may experience difficulty breathing, ankle swelling\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2207Mitral valve prolapseKEY TERMS\nHeart murmur —Sound during the heartbeat caused\nby a heart valve that does not close properly.\nRheumatic heart disease —A condition caused by\na streptococcus infection which can result in per-manent heart damage.and fluid in the lungs. Other symptoms may include anxi-\nety, headaches, morning tiredness and constantly cold\nhands and feet. Death from this condition is rare.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of MVP is based on symptoms and\nphysical exam. During the exam, the physician may heara click and/or heart murmur with a stethoscope.\nThe best diagnostic test for MVP is the echocardio-\ngram. The test reflects sound waves through the chestwall to give two-dimensional color flow pictures of theheart, its size, position, motion, chambers, and valves.Unfortunately, during the early 1980s, this diagnosis wasoften made excessively from faulty echocardiographiccriteria prevalent at that time.\nAny person with symptoms or family history of\nMVP should consider having an echocardiogram. Thetest takes 15-20 minutes and is done in doctors’ officesand hospitals. It is performed by trained technicians andis read by cardiologists. Family physicians, internists,cardiologists, and nurse practitioners can treat MVP.Echocardiograms are recommended periodically depend-ing on the extent of valve leakage.\nTreatment\nPersons who experience certain types of an irregular\nheartbeat with MVP should be treated. Propranolol(Inderal) or other beta blockers or digoxin (Lanoxin) areoften helpful. Persons who develop moderate to severe\nsymptoms with a leaky mitral valve may require repair orreplacement of the mitral valve with an artificial heartvalve. Persons with MVP and a leaky valve need to pro-tect themselves from heart or heart valve infections.Antibiotics should be taken before any surgical, dental\nor oral procedures according to the American HeartAssociation recommendations.\nOther treatments include drinking lots of fluids during\nstrenuous activity and hot weather. Water pills, caffeine\nand donating blood may aggravate the symptoms of MVP.\nPrognosis\nMVP is usually not a serious condition. However,\ndangerous, untreated irregular heartbeats may rarelycause sudden death. These persons should be carefullymonitored.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2208Mitral valve prolapse\nMitral valve prolapse Mitral valve stenosis\nMitral valve prolapse occurs when the mitral valve does not open and close properly. When this happens, the valve may bal-\nloon into the left atrium of the heart, causing the mitral valve to leak blood backward.

If the mitral valve is abnormally narrow, dueto disease or birth defect, blood flow from the atrium tothe ventricle is restricted. This restricted flow leads to anincrease in the pressure of blood in the left atrium. Over aperiod of time, this back pressure causes fluid to leak intothe lungs. It can also lead to an abnormal heart rhythm(atrial fibrillation), which further decreases the efficiencyof the pumping action of the heart.\nCauses and symptoms\nMitral valve stenosis is almost always caused by\nrheumatic fever . As a result of rheumatic fever , the\nleaflets that form the opening of the valve are partiallyfused together. Mitral valve stenosis can also be presentat birth. Babies born with this problem usually requiresurgery if they are to survive. Sometimes, growths ortumors can block the mitral valve, mimicking mitralvalve stenosis.\nIf the restriction is severe, the increased blood pres-\nsure can lead to heart failure . The first symptoms of heart\nfailure, which are fatigue and shortness of breath , usual-\nly appear only during physical activity. As the conditiongets worse, symptoms may also be felt even during rest. Aperson may also develop a deep red coloring in the cheeks.KEY TERMS\nAtrium —One of the two upper chambers of the\nheart.\nBeta blocker —A drug that can be used to reduce\nblood pressure.\nRheumatic fever —An illness which sometimes\nfollows a streptococcal infection of the throat.\nVentricle —One of the two lower chambers of the\nheart.\nDiagnosis\nMitral valve stenosis is usually detected by a physician\nlistening to heart sounds. Normal heart valves open silentlyto permit the flow of blood. A stenotic valve makes a snap-ping sound followed by a “rumbling” murmur. The condi-tion can be confirmed with a chest x ray and an electrocar-\ndiogram, both of which will show an enlarged atrium.Echocardiography , which produces images of the heart’s\nstructure, is also helpful in making the diagnosis. If surgeryis necessary, cardiac catheterization may be done to fully\nevaluate the heart before the operation.\nTreatment\nDrug therapy may help to slow the heart rate,\nstrengthen the heart beat, and control abnormal heartrhythm. Drugs such as beta blockers ,calcium channel\nblockers , and digoxin may be prescribed. A drug that\nprevents abnormal blood clotting (anticoagulant) calledwarfarin (Coumadin) may be recommended. If drug ther-apy does not produce satisfactory results, valve repair orreplacement may be necessary.\nRepair can be accomplished in two ways. In the first\nmethod, balloon valvuloplasty , the doctor will try to\nstretch the valve opening by threading a thin tube(catheter) with a balloon tip through a vein and into theheart. Once the catheter is positioned in the valve, theballoon is inflated, separating the fused areas. The sec-ond method involves opening the heart and surgicallyseparating the fused areas.\nIf the valve is damaged beyond repair, it can be\nreplaced with a mechanical valve or one that is partlymechanical and partly made from a pig’s heart.\nPrognosis\nProcedures available to treat mitral valve stenosis,\nwhether medical or surgical, all produce effective results.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2209Mitral valve stenosisPrevention\nThe only possible way to prevent mitral valve steno-\nsis is to prevent rheumatic fever.

    "title": "Moles",
    "content": "Moles\nDefinition\nA mole (nevus) is a pigmented (colored) spot on the\nouter layer of the skin (epidermis).\nDescription\nMoles can be round, oval, flat, or raised. They can\noccur singly or in clusters on any part of the body. Mostmoles are brown, but colors can range from pinkish fleshtones to yellow, dark blue, or black.\nEveryone has at least a few moles. They generally\nappear by the time a person is 20 and look, at first, likefreckles. A mole’s color and shape don’t usually change.Changes in hormone levels that occur during puberty\nand pregnancy can make moles larger and darker. New\nmoles may also appear during this period.\nA mole usually lasts about 50 years before begin-\nning to fade. Some moles disappear completely, andsome never lighten at all. Some moles develop stalks thatraise them above the skin’s surface; these moles eventu-ally drop off.Types of moles\nAbout 1-3% of all babies have one or more moles\nwhen they are born. Moles that are present at birth arecalled congenital nevi.\nOther types of moles include:\n• junctional moles, which are usually brown and may be\nflat or slightly raised\n• compound moles, which are slightly raised, range in\ncolor from tan to dark brown, and involve pigment-pro-ducing cells (melanocytes) in both the upper and lowerlayers of the skin (epidermis and dermis)\n• dermal moles, which range from flesh-color to brown,\nare elevated, most common on the upper body, and maycontain hairs\n• sebaceous moles, which are produced by over-active oil\nglands and are yellow and rough-textured\n• blue moles, which are slightly raised, colored by pig-\nment deep within the skin, and most common on thehead, neck, and arms of women\nMost moles are benign, but atypical moles (dysplas-\ntic nevi) may develop into malignant melanoma ,a\npotentially fatal form of skin cancer . Atypical moles are\nusually hereditary. Most are bigger than a pencil eraser,and the shape and pigmentation are irregular.\nCongenital nevi are more apt to become cancerous\nthan moles that develop after birth, especially if they aremore than eight inches in diameter. Lentigo maligna(melanotic freckle of Hutchinson), most common on theface and after the age of 50, first appears as a flat spotcontaining two or more shades of tan. It graduallybecomes larger and darker. One in three of these molesdevelop into a form of skin cancer known as lentigomaligna melanoma.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe cause of moles is unknown, although atypical\nmoles seem to run in families and result from exposure tosunlight.\nDiagnosis\nOnly a small percentage of moles require medical\nattention. A mole that has the following symptomsshould be evaluated by a dermatologist (a physicianspealizing in skin diseases).\n• appears after the age of 20• bleeds• itches• looks unusual or changes in any way\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2210MolesA doctor who suspects skin cancer will remove all or\npart of the mole for microscopic examination. This pro-cedure, which is usually performed in a doctor’s office, issimple, relatively painless, and doesn’t take more than afew minutes. It does leave a scar.\nTreatment\nIf laboratory analysis confirms that a mole is cancer-\nous, the dermatologist will remove the rest of the mole.Patients should realize that slicing off a section of amalignant mole will not cause the cancer to spread.\nRemoving a mole for cosmetic reasons involves\nnumbing the area and using scissors or a scalpel toremove the elevated portion. The patient is left with a flatmole the same color as the original growth. Cutting outparts of the mole above and beneath the surface of theskin can leave a scar more noticeable than the mole.\nScissors or a razor can be used to temporarily\nremove hair from a mole. Permanent hair removalrequires electrolysis or surgical removal of the mole.\nPrognosis\nMoles are rarely cancerous and, once removed,\nunlikely to recur. A dermatologist should be consulted ifa mole reappears after being removed.Prevention\nWearing a sunscreen and limiting sun exposure may\nprevent some moles. Anyone who has moles should exam-ine them every month and see a dermatologist if changes insize, shape, color, or texture occur or if new moles appear.\nAnyone with a family history of melanoma should\nsee a dermatologist for an annual skin examination.Everyone should know the ABCDs of melanoma:\n• A: Asymmetry, which occurs when the two halves of\nthe mole are not identical\n• B: Borders that are irregular or indistinct\n• C: Color that varies in a single mole• D: Diameter, which should be no larger than the eraser\non a pencil.\nA mole exhibiting any of these characteristics\nshould be evaluated by a dermatologist.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

    "title": "Monkeypox",
    "content": "Monkeypox\nDefinition\nCertain African squirrels and primates carry a virus\nthat causes monkeypox in humans. This virus is relatedto the smallpox virus, but it usually produces a less\nsevere illness with fewer fatalities. However, symptomsare similar: fever , pus-filled blisters all over the body,\nand respiratory problems.\nDescription\nMost monkeypox cases have been diagnosed in\nremote areas of central and west Africa. Contact withinfected animals is unusual because they are isolated inforests, away from humans. However, between February1996 and October 1997, there were 511 suspected casesof monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the CongoKEY TERMS\nMalignant melanoma —Most moles are benign,\nbut atypical moles (called dysplastic nevi) maydevelop into malignant melanoma, a potentiallyfatal form of skin cancer. Atypical moles are usual-ly hereditary. Most are bigger than a pencil eraser,and the shape and pigmentation are irregular.(DRC, formerly Zaire). This outbreak, the largest ever,\nraised fears that the virus had mutated and become moreinfectious.\nIn late 1997, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) announced that this relatively large outbreakwas likely due to human behavior, rather than virusmutation. During the outbreak, the DRC was embroiledin civil war. Food shortages increased reliance on hunt-ing and raised chances that people would come into con-tact with infected animals.\nMonkeypox is less severe than smallpox and can\nsometimes be confused with chickenpox . It seems partly\npreventable with smallpox vaccination , but vaccination\nprograms were discontinued in the late 1970s. (Barringsamples stored in laboratories, smallpox has been eradi-cated.) People under the age of 16—those born aftersmallpox vaccination ended—seem the most susceptibleto monkeypox. During the 1996-97 outbreak, approxi-mately 85% of the cases were in this age group.\nThis outbreak also seemed to indicate high person-\nto-person transmission. Initial reports claimed as manyas 78% of suspected cases were transmitted person toperson rather than animal to person. However, accordingto WHO and the CDC, further study revealed that about8% of cases were transmitted this way.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe monkeypox virus is transmitted to humans\nthrough an infected animal’s blood or by its bite. Initialsymptoms are a fever and a bodywide rash of pus-filledblisters. These symptoms can be accompanied by diar-\nrhea , swollen lymph nodes, a sore throat , and mouth\nsores. In some cases, a victim may experience troublebreathing. Symptoms are at their worst for 3-7 days, afterwhich the fever lessens and blisters begin to form crusts.\nDiagnosis\nSince the symptoms resemble other pox diseases,\ndefinitive diagnosis may require laboratory testing touncover the virus or evidence that it is present.\nTreatment\nLike most viruses, monkeypox cannot be resolved\nwith medication. The only treatment option is sympto-matic—that is, patients are made as comfortable as possi-ble. In March 1998, the U.S. Army Medical Research Insti-tute for Infectious Diseases reported that an antiviral drugcalled cidofovir may combat monkeypox infection. Thedrug has worked successfully in primates, but furtherresearch is needed to determine its effectiveness in humans.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2212MonkeypoxPrognosis\nChildren are more likely to contract the disease and\nhave the highest death rate. Monkeypox is not as lethal\nas smallpox, but the death rate among young childrenmay reach 2-10%. In some cases, hospitalization isrequired. Recovery is good among survivors, althoughsome scarring may result from the blisters.\nPrevention\nAlthough smallpox vaccination may protect against\nmonkeypox, experts do not generally recommend gettinga smallpox vaccine simply to guard against monkeypox.This vaccine carries risks, including severe, potentiallyfatal complications. For most people, the risk posed bythe smallpox vaccine far outweighs the odds that theymight come in contact with the monkeypox virus.\nResources\nBOOKS\nFenner, Frank. “Human Monkeypox, a Newly Discovered\nVirus Disease.” In Emerging Viruses , ed.

Like other antidepres-\nsant drugs , MAO inhibitors help reduce the extreme\nsadness, hopelessness, and lack of interest in life that aretypical in people with depression. MAO inhibitors areespecially useful in treating people whose depression iscombined with other problems such as anxiety , panic\nattacks, phobias , or the desire to sleep too much.KEY TERMS\nAntiviral —Refers to a drug that can destroy viruses\nand help treat illnesses caused by them.\nMutation —A change in an organism’s genetic\ncode that causes it to develop new characteristics.\nSymptomatic —Refers to treatment that addresses\nthe symptoms of an illness, but not its underlyingcause.\nDescription\nDiscovered in the 1950s, MAO inhibitors work by\ncorrecting chemical imbalances in the brain. Normally,natural chemicals called neurotransmitters carry signalsfrom one brain cell to another. Some neurotransmitters,such as serotonin and norepinephrine, play importantroles in controlling mood. But other substances in thebrain may interfere with mood control by breaking downthese neurotransmitters. Researchers believe that MAOinhibitors work by blocking the chemicals that breakdown serotonin and norepinephrine. This gives the neu-rotransmitters more time to do their important work.\nBecause MAO inhibitors also affect other chemicals\nthroughout the body, these drugs may produce manyunwanted side effects. They can be especially dangerouswhen taken with certain foods, beverages and medicines.Anyone taking these drugs should ask his or her physi-cian or pharmacist for a list of products to avoid.\nMAO inhibitors are available only with a physician’s\nprescription. They are sold in tablet form. Some common-ly used MAO inhibitors are isocarboxazid (Marplan),phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Parnate).\nRecommended dosage\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\nMAO inhibitor and the type of depression for which it isbeing taken. Dosages may be different for differentpatients. Check with the physician who prescribed thedrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for thecorrect dosage.\nAlways take MAO inhibitors exactly as directed by\nyour physician. Never take larger or more frequent doses,and do not take the drug for longer than directed. See thephysician regularly while taking this medicine, especiallyin the first few months of treatment. The physician willcheck to make sure the medicine is working as it shouldand will note unwanted side effects. The physician mayalso need to adjust the dosage during this period.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2213Monoamine oxidase inhibitorsSeveral weeks may be needed for the effects of this\nmedicine to be felt. Be sure to keep taking it as directed,even if it does not seem to be helping.\nDo not stop taking this medicine suddenly. Tapering\nthe dose may be necessary to reduce the chance of with-drawal symptoms. If it is necessary to stop taking thedrug, check with the physician who prescribed it forinstructions on how to stop.\nMAO inhibitors may be taken with or without food, on\na full or empty stomach. Check package directions or askthe physician or pharmacist for instructions on how to takethe medicine. Remember that some foods and beveragesmust be avoided during treatment with MAO inhibitors.\nPrecautions\nThe effects of this medicine may continue for two\nweeks or more after patients stop taking it. All precau-tions should be observed during this period, as well asthroughout treatment with MAO inhibitors.\nMAO inhibitors may cause serious and possibly life-\nthreatening reactions, such as sudden high blood pressure,when taken with certain foods, beverages, or medicines.The dangerous reactions may not begin until several hoursafter consuming these items. Aged cheeses, red wines,smoked or pickled meats, chocolate, caffeinated bever-ages, and foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG)are among the foods and drinks to be avoided. Be sure toget a complete list from the physician who prescribed themedicine or the pharmacist who filled the prescription.\nDo not drink any alcoholic beverages or reduced-\nalcohol or alcohol-free beer or wine while taking thismedicine.\nAnyone who is taking MAO inhibitors should not\nuse any other medicine unless it has been approved orprescribed by a physician who knows that they are takingMAO inhibitors. This includes nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines such as sleep aids; medicines forcolds, cough ,h a y  fever , or asthma (including nose\ndrops or sprays); medicines to increase alertness or keepfrom falling asleep; and appetite control products.\nBecause MAO inhibitors work on the central ner-\nvous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol andother drugs that slow down the central nervous system,such as antihistamines , cold medicine, allergy medicine,\nsleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, somepain relievers, and muscle relaxants . Anyone taking\nMAO inhibitors should check with his or her physicianbefore taking any of the above.\nMAO inhibitors may interact with medicines used\nduring surgery, dental procedures, or emergency treat-ment. These interactions could increase the chance of\nside effects. Anyone who is taking MAO inhibitorsshould be sure to tell the health care professional incharge before having any surgical or dental procedures orreceiving emergency treatment.\nSome people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less\nalert when using MAO inhibitors. The drugs may alsocause blurred vision. For these reasons, anyone whotakes these drugs should not drive, use machines or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.\nThese medicines also make some people feel light-\nheaded, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting orlying down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually andhold onto something for support if possible.\nOlder people may be especially sensitive to the\neffects of MAO inhibitors. This may increase the chanceof side effects, such as dizziness or lightheadedness.\nSpecial conditions\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake MAO inhibitors. Before taking these drugs, be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions:\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\nto MAO inhibitors in the past should let his or her physi-cian know before taking the drugs again. The physicianshould also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes,\npreservatives, or other substances.\nPREGNANCY. Studies suggest that taking MAO\ninhibitors during pregnancy may increase the risk of\nbirth defects or problems in the newborn after birth.\nWomen who are pregnant or who may become pregnantshould check with their physicians before using MAOinhibitors.\nBREASTFEEDING. MAO inhibitors may pass into\nbreast milk, but no problems have been reported in nurs-ing babies whose mothers took the medicine. Womenwho are breastfeeding their babies should check withtheir physicians before using this medicine.\nDIABETES. MAO inhibitors may affect blood sugar\nlevels. Persons with diabetes who are taking this medi-cine and notice changes in their blood or urine testsshould check with their physicians.\nANGINA. MAO inhibitors may make people feel\nunusually energetic and healthy. People with angina\n(chest pain) should be careful not to overexert them-selves and should check with their physicians beforeincreasing their levels of activity or exercise .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2214Monoamine oxidase inhibitorsOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using MAO\ninhibitors, people with any of these medical problemsshould make sure their physicians are aware of their con-ditions:\n• alcohol abuse\n• high blood pressure\n• recent heart attack or stroke\n• heart or blood vessel disease\n• liver disease\n• kidney disease• frequent or severe headaches\n• epilepsy\n• parkinson’s disease\n• current or past mental illness\n• asthma or bronchitis\n• overactive thyroid\n• pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland)\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking MAO inhibitors\nwith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.\nSide effects\nThe most common side effects are dizziness, light-\nheadedness, drowsiness, tiredness, weakness, blurredvision, shakiness or trembling, restlessness, sleep prob-lems or twitching during sleep, increased appetite (espe-cially for sweets), weight gain, decreased sexual ability,decreased amount of urine, and mild headache . These\nproblems usually go away as the body adjusts to the drugand do not require medical treatment unless they inter-fere with normal activities.\nMore serious side effects may occur. If any of the\nfollowing side effects occur, stop taking the medicineand get emergency medical attention immediately:\n• severe chest pain\n• severe headache\n• stiff, sore neck• enlarged pupils\n• increased sensitivity of eyes to light\n• fast or slow heartbeat\n• sweating, with or without fever or cold, clammy skin\n• nausea and vomiting\nOther side effects may occur.

    "title": "Mood disorders",
    "content": "Mood disorders\nDefinition\nMood disorders are mental disorders characterized\nby periods of depression, sometimes alternating withperiods of elevated mood.\nDescription\nWhile many people go through sad or elated moods\nfrom time to time, people with mood disorders sufferfrom severe or prolonged mood states that disrupt theirdaily functioning. Among the general mood disordersclassified in the fourth edition (1994) of the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV )\nare major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder , and\ndysthymia.\nIn classifying and diagnosing mood disorders, doc-\ntors determine if the mood disorder is unipolar or bipolar.When only one extreme in mood (the depressed state) isexperienced, this type of depression is called unipolar.Major depression refers to a single severe period ofdepression, marked by negative or hopeless thoughts andphysical symptoms like fatigue . In major depressive dis-\norder, some patients have isolated episodes of depres-sion. In between these episodes, the patient does not feeldepressed or have other symptoms associated withdepression. Other patients have more frequent episodes.\nBipolar depression or bipolar disorder (sometimes\ncalled manic depression) refers to a condition in whichpeople experience two extremes in mood. They alternatebetween depression (the “low” mood) and mania or\nhypomania (the “high” mood). These patients go fromdepression to a frenzied, abnormal elevation in mood.Mania and hypomania are similar, but mania is usuallymore severe and debilitating to the patient.\nDysthymia is a recurrent or lengthy depression that\nmay last a lifetime. It is similar to major depressive disor-der, but dysthymia is chronic, long-lasting, persistent, andmild. Patients may have symptoms that are not as severe asmajor depression, but the symptoms last for many years. Itseems that a mild form of the depression is always present.In some cases, people may also experience a major depres-sive episode on top of their dysthymia, a condition some-times referred to as a “double depression.”\nCauses and symptoms\nMood disorders tend to run in families. These disor-\nders are associated with imbalances in certain chemicalsthat carry signals between brain cells (neurotransmit-ters). These chemicals include serotonin, norepinephrine,and dopamine. Women are more vulnerable to unipolardepression than are men. Major life stressors (likedivorce, serious financial problems, death of a family\nmember, etc.) will often provoke the symptoms ofdepression in susceptible people.\nMajor depression is more serious than just feeling\n“sad” or “blue.” The symptoms of major depression mayinclude:\n• loss of appetite• a change in the sleep pattern, like not sleeping ( insom-\nnia) or sleeping too much\n• feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or inappropri-\nate guilt\n• fatigue\n• difficulty in concentrating or making decisions• overwhelming and intense feelings of sadness or grief• disturbed thinking. The person may also have physical\nsymptoms like stomachaches or headaches\nBipolar disorder includes mania or hypomania.\nMania is an abnormal elevation in mood. The personmay be excessively cheerful, have grandiose ideas, andmay sleep less. They may talk nonstop for hours, haveunending enthusiasm, and demonstrate poor judgement.Sometimes the elevation in mood is marked by irritabili-ty and hostility rather than cheerfulness. While the per-son may at first seem normal with an increase in energy,others who know the person well see a marked differencein behavior. The patient may seem to be in a frenzy andwill often make poor, bizarre, or dangerous choices inhis/her personal and professional lives. Hypomania is notas severe as mania and does not cause the level of impair-ment in work and social activities that mania can.\nDiagnosis\nDoctors diagnose mood disorders based on the\npatient’s description of the symptoms as well as the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2216Mood disorderspatient’s family history. The length of time the patient\nhas had symptoms is also important. Generally patientsare diagnosed with dysthymia if they feel depressedmore days than not for at least two years. The depressionis mild but long lasting. In major depressive disorder, thepatient is depressed almost all day nearly every day ofthe week for at least two weeks. The depression is severe.Sometimes laboratory tests are performed to rule outother causes for the symptoms (like thyroid disease). Thediagnosis may be confirmed when a patient respondswell to medication.\nTreatment\nThe most effective treatment for mood disorders is a\ncombination of medication and psychotherapy. The fourdifferent classes of drugs used in mood disorders are:\n• heterocyclic antidepressants (HCAs), like amitriptyline\n(Elavil)\n• selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI inhibitors),\nlike fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertra-line (Zoloft)\n• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI inhibitors), like\nphenelzine sulfate (Nardil) and tranylcypromine sulfate(Parnate)\n• mood stabilizers, like lithium carbonate (Eskalith) and\nvalproate, often used in people with bipolar mood dis-orders\nA number of psychotherapy approaches are useful as\nwell. Interpersonal psychotherapy helps the patient rec-ognize the interaction between the mood disorder andinterpersonal relationships. Cognitive-behavioral ther-\napyexplores how the patient’s view of the world may be\naffecting his or her mood and outlook.\nWhen depression fails to respond to treatment or\nwhen there is a high risk of suicide, electroconvulsive\ntherapy (ECT) is sometimes used. ECT is believed to\naffect neurotransmitters like the medications do.Patients are anesthetized and given muscle relaxants to\nminimize discomfort. Then low-level electric current ispassed through the brain to cause a brief convulsion.The most common side effect of ECT is mild, short-termmemory loss.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are many alternative therapies that may help\nin the treatment of mood disorders, including acupunc-\nture, botanical medicine, homeopathy ,aromatherapy ,\nconstitutional hydrotherapy , and light therapy. The ther-\napy used is an individual choice. Short-term clinicalstudies have shown that the herb St. John’s wortKEY TERMS\nCognitive therapy —Psychotherapy technique\ndesigned to help people change their attitudes,perceptions, and patterns of thinking.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) —Therapy for\nmood disorders that involves passing electricalcurrent through the brain in order to create a briefconvulsion.\nNeurotransmitter —A chemical that aids or alters\nthe transmission of impulses between the pointsthat connect nerves.\nSerotonin —A chemical messenger in the brain\nthought to play a role in mood regulation.\n(Hypericum perforatum ) can effectively treat some types\nof depression. Though it appears very safe, the herb mayhave some side effects and its long-term effectivenesshas not been proven. It has not been tested in patientswith bipolar disorder. St. John’s wort and antidepres-\nsant drugs should not be taken simultaneously, so\npatients should tell their doctor if they are taking St.John’s wort.\nPrognosis\nMost cases of mood disorders can be successfully\nmanaged if properly diagnosed and treated.\nPrevention\nPeople can take steps to improve mild depression\nand keep it from becoming worse. They can learn stress\nmanagement (like relaxation training or breathing exer-cises), exercise regularly, and avoid drugs or alcohol.\nResources\nBOOKS\nGold, Mark S.

    "title": "Motion sickness",
    "content": "Motion sickness\nDefinition\nMotion sickness is the uncomfortable dizziness ,\nnausea, and vomiting that people experience when theirsense of balance and equilibrium is disturbed by constantmotion. Riding in a car, aboard a ship or boat, or ridingon a swing all cause stimulation of the vestibular systemand visual stimulation that often leads to discomfort.While motion sickness can be bothersome, it is not aserious illness, and can be prevented.\nDescription\nMotion sickness is a common problem with nearly\n80% of the population enduring its affects at one time intheir lives. While it may occur at any age, motion sick-ness most often afflicts children over the age of two, withthe majority outgrowing this susceptibility.\nWhen looking at why motion sickness occurs, it is\nhelpful to understand the role of the sensory organs. Thesensory organs control a body’s sense of balance by tellingthe brain what direction the body is pointing, the directionit is moving, and if it is standing still or turning. Thesemessages are relayed by the inner ears (or labyrinth); theeyes; the skin pressure receptors, such as in those in thefeet; the muscle and joint sensory receptors, which trackwhat body parts are moving; and the central nervous sys-tem (the brain and spinal cord), which is responsible forprocessing all incoming sensory information.Motion sickness and its symptoms surface when\nconflicting messages are sent to the central nervous sys-tem. An example of this is reading a book in the backseat of a moving car. The inner ears and skin receptorssense the motion, but the eyes register only the stationarypages of the book. This conflicting information maycause the usual motion sickness symptoms of dizziness,nausea and vomiting .\nCauses and symptoms\nWhile all five of the body’s sensory organs con-\ntribute to motion sickness, excess stimulation to thevestibular system within the inner ear (the body’s “bal-ance center”) has been shown to be one of the primaryreasons for this condition. Balance problems, or vertigo,are caused by a conflict between what is seen and howthe inner ear perceives it, leading to confusion in thebrain. This confusion may result in higher heart rates,rapid breathing, nausea and sweating, along with dizzi-ness and vomiting.\nPure optokinetic motion sickness is caused solely by\nvisual stimuli, or what is seen. The optokinetic system isthe reflex that allow the eyes to move when an objectmoves. Many people suffer when what they view is rotat-ing or swaying, even if they are standing still.\nAdditional factors that may contribute to the occur-\nrence of motion sickness include:\n• Poor ventilation.\n• Anxiety or fear. Both have been found to lower a per-\nson’s threshold for experiencing motion sickness symp-toms.\n• Food. It is recommended that a heavy meal of spicy and\ngreasy foods be avoided before and during a trip.\n• Alcohol. A drink is often thought to help calm the\nnerves, but in this case it could upset the stomach fur-ther. A hangover for the next morning’s trip may alsolead to motion sickness.\n• Genetic predisposition. Research suggests that some\npeople are predisposed to motion sickness symptomspartly due to a hereditary link.\nOften viewed as a minor annoyance, some travelers\nare temporarily immobilized by motion sickness, and afew continue to feel its effects for hours and even daysafter a trip (the “mal d’embarquement” syndrome).\nDiagnosis\nMost cases of motion sickness are mild and self-\ntreatable disorders. If symptoms such as dizzinessbecome chronic, a doctor may be able to help alleviate\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2218Motion sicknessthe discomfort by looking further into a patient’s general\nhealth. Questions regarding medications, head injuries,recent infections, and other questions about the ear andneurological system will be asked. An examination of theears, nose, and throat, as well as tests of nerve and bal-ance function, may also be completed.\nSevere cases of motion sickness symptoms, and\nthose that become progressively worse, may requireadditional, specific tests. Diagnosis in these situationsdeserves the attention and care of a doctor with special-ized skills in diseases of the ear, nose, throat, equilibri-um, and neurological system.\nTreatment\nThere are a variety of medications to help ease the\nsymptoms of motion sickness, and most of these areavailable without a prescription. Known as over-the-counter (OTC) medications, it is recommended that thesebe taken 30-60 minutes before traveling to prevent motionsickness symptoms, as well as during an extended trip.\nDrugs\nThe following OTC drugs consist of ingredients that\nhave been considered safe and effective for the treatmentof motion sickness by the Food and Drug Administration:\n• Marezine (and others). Includes the active ingredient\ncyclizine and is not for use in children under age 6.\n• Benadryl (and others). Includes the active ingredient\ndiphenhydramine and is not for use in children underage 6.\n• Dramamine (and others). Includes the active ingredient\ndimenhydrinate and is not for use in children under age 2.\n• Bonine (and others). Includes the active ingredient\nmeclizine and is not for use in children under age 12.\nEach of the active ingredients listed above are anti-\nhistamines whose main side effect is drowsiness. Cau-\ntion should be used when driving a vehicle or operatingmachinery, and alcohol should be avoided when takingany drug for motion sickness. Large doses of OTC drugsfor motion sickness may also cause dry mouth and occa-\nsional blurred vision.\nThe Food and Drug Administration recommends\nthat people with emphysema , chronic bronchitis ,glau-\ncoma , or difficulty urinating due to an enlarged\nprostate do not use OTC drugs for motion sickness\nunless directed by their doctor.\nLonger trips may require a prescription medication\ncalled scopolamine (Transderm Scop). Formerly used inthe transdermal skin patch (now discontinued), travelersmust now ask their doctor to prescribe it in the form of agel. In gel form, scopolamine is most effective when\nsmeared on the arm or neck and covered with a bandage.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments for motion sickness have\nbecome widely accepted as a standard means of care. Gin-ger (Zingiber officinale ) in its various forms is often used\nto calm the stomach, and it is now known that the oils itcontains (gingerols and shogaols) appear to relax theintestinal tract in addition to mildly depressing the centralnervous system. Some of the most effective forms of gin-ger include the powdered, encapsulated form; ginger teaprepared from sliced ginger root; or candied pieces. Allforms of ginger should be taken on an empty stomach.\nPlacing manual pressure on the Neiguan or Peri-\ncardium-6 acupuncture point (located about three fin-\nger-widths above the wrist on the inner arm), either byacupuncture, acupressure , or a mild, electrical pulse,\nhas shown to be effective against the symptoms ofmotion sickness. Elastic wristbands sold at most drug-stores are also used as a source of relief due to the pres-sure it places in this area. Pressing the small intestine 17(just below the earlobes in the indentations behind thejawbone) may also help in the functioning of the ear’sbalancing mechanism.\nThere are several homeopathic remedies that work\nspecifically for motion sickness. They include Cocculus ,\nPetroleum , and Tabacum .\nPrognosis\nWhile there is no cure for motion sickness, its symp-\ntoms can be controlled or even prevented. Most peoplerespond successfully to the variety of treatments, or avoidthe unpleasant symptoms through prevention methods.\nPrevention\nBecause motion sickness is easier to prevent than\ntreat once it has begun, the best treatment is prevention.The following steps may help deter the unpleasant symp-toms of motion sickness before they occur:\n• Avoid reading while traveling, and do not sit in a back-\nward facing seat.\n• Always ride where the eyes may see the same motion\nthat the body and inner ears feel. Safe positions includethe front seat of the car while looking at distantscenery; the deck of a ship where the horizon can beseen; and sitting by the window of an airplane. Theleast motion on an airplane is in a seat over the wings.\n• Maintain a fairly straight-ahead view.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2219Motion sickness• Eat a light meal before traveling, or if already nauseat-\ned, avoid food altogether.\n• Avoid watching or talking to another traveler who is\nhaving motion sickness.\n• Take motion sickness medicine at least 30-60 minutes\nbefore travel begins, or as recommended by a physi-cian.\n• Learn to live with the condition. Even those who fre-\nquently endure motion sickness can learn to travel byanticipating the conditions of their next trip. Researchalso suggests that increased exposure to the stimulationthat causes motion sickness may help decrease itssymptoms on future trips.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBlakely, Brian W., and Mary-Ellen Siegel. “Peripheral Vestibu-\nlar Disorders.” In Feeling Dizzy: Understanding and\nTreating Dizziness, Vertigo, and Other Balance Disorders.New York: Macmillan, 1995.\nThe Editors of Time-Life Books.

    "title": "Movement disorders",
    "content": "Movement disorders\nDefinition\nMovement disorders are a group of diseases and\nsyndromes affecting the ability to produce and controlmovement.\nDescription\nThough it seems simple and effortless, normal\nmovement in fact requires an astonishingly complex sys-tem of control. Disruption of any portion of this systemcan cause a person to produce movements that are tooweak, too forceful, too uncoordinated, or too poorly con-trolled for the task at hand. Unwanted movements mayoccur at rest. Intentional movement may become impos-sible. Such conditions are called movement disorders.\nAbnormal movements themselves are symptoms of\nunderlying disorders. In some cases, the abnormal move-ments are the only symptoms. Disorders causing abnor-mal movements include:\n•Parkinson’s disease\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2220Movement disorders• Parkinsonism caused by drugs or poisons\n• Parkinson-plus syndromes ( progressive supranuclear\npalsy , multiple system atrophy, and cortical-basal gan-\nglionic degeneration)\n• Huntington’s disease\n• Wilson’s disease\n• inherited ataxias ( Friedreich’s ataxia , Machado-\nJoseph disease, and spinocerebellar ataxias)\n•tourette syndrome and other tic disorders\n• essential tremor• restless leg syndrome\n• dystonia\n• stroke•cerebral palsy\n• encephalopathies\n• intoxication\n• poisoning by carbon monoxide, cyanide, methanol, or\nmanganese\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nMovement is produced and coordinated by several\ninteracting brain centers, including the motor cortex, thecerebellum, and a group of structures in the inner por-tions of the brain called the basal ganglia. Sensory infor-mation provides critical input on the current position andvelocity of body parts, and spinal nerve cells (neurons)help prevent opposing muscle groups from contracting atthe same time.\nTo understand how movement disorders occur, it is\nhelpful to consider a normal voluntary movement, suchas reaching to touch a nearby object with the right indexfinger. To accomplish the desired movement, the armmust be lifted and extended. The hand must be held outto align with the forearm, and the forefinger must beextended while the other fingers remain flexed.\nTHE MOTOR CORTEX. V oluntary motor commands\nbegin in the motor cortex located on the outer, wrinkledsurface of the brain. Movement of the right arm is begunby the left motor cortex, which generates a large volleyof signals to the involved muscles. These electrical sig-nals pass along upper motor neurons through the mid-brain to the spinal cord. Within the spinal cord, they con-nect to lower motor neurons, which convey the signalsout of the spinal cord to the surface of the musclesinvolved. Electrical stimulation of the muscles causescontraction, and the force of contraction pulling on theskeleton causes movement of the arm, hand, and fingers.Damage to or death of any of the neurons along this\npath causes weakness or paralysis of the affected mus-\ncles.\nANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE PAIRS. This picture of\nmovement is too simple, however. One important refine-ment to it comes from considering the role of opposing,or antagonistic, muscle pairs. Contraction of the bicepsmuscle, located on the top of the upper arm, pulls on theforearm to flex the elbow and bend the arm. Contractionof the triceps, located on the opposite side, extends theelbow and straightens the arm. Within the spine, thesemuscles are normally wired so that willed (voluntary)contraction of one is automatically accompanied byblocking of the other. In other words, the command tocontract the biceps provokes another command withinthe spine to prevent contraction of the triceps. In thisway, these antagonist muscles are kept from resisting oneanother. Spinal cord or brain injury can damage this con-trol system and cause involuntary simultaneous contrac-tion and spasticity, an increase in resistance to movementduring motion.\nTHE CEREBELLUM. Once the movement of the arm is\ninitiated, sensory information is needed to guide the fin-ger to its precise destination. In addition to sight, themost important source of information comes from the“position sense” provided by the many sensory neuronslocated within the limbs (proprioception). Proprioceptionis what allows you to touch your nose with your fingereven with your eyes closed. The balance organs in theears provide important information about posture. Bothpostural and proprioceptive information are processed bya structure at the rear of the brain called the cerebellum.The cerebellum sends out electrical signals to modifymovements as they progress, “sculpting” the barrage ofvoluntary commands into a tightly controlled, constantlyevolving pattern. Cerebellar disorders cause inability tocontrol the force, fine positioning, and speed of move-ments (ataxia). Disorders of the cerebellum may alsoimpair the ability to judge distance so that a personunder- or over-reaches the target (dysmetria). Tremorduring voluntary movements can also result from cere-bellar damage.\nTHE BASAL GANGLIA. Both the cerebellum and the\nmotor cortex send information to a set of structures deepwithin the brain that help control involuntary compo-nents of movement (basal ganglia). The basal gangliasend output messages to the motor cortex, helping to ini-tiate movements, regulate repetitive or patterned move-ments, and control muscle tone.\nCircuits within the basal ganglia are complex. With-\nin this structure, some groups of cells begin the action ofother basal ganglia components and some groups of cells\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2221Movement disordersblock the action. These complicated feedback circuits are\nnot entirely understood. Disruptions of these circuits areknown to cause several distinct movement disorders. Aportion of the basal ganglia called the substantia nigrasends electrical signals that block output from anotherstructure called the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalam-ic nucleus sends signals to the globus pallidus, which inturn blocks the thalamic nuclei. Finally, the thalamicnuclei send signals to the motor cortex. The substantianigra, then, begins movement and the globus pallidusblocks it.\nThis complicated circuit can be disrupted at several\npoints. For instance, loss of substantia nigra cells, as inParkinson’s disease, increases blocking of the thalamicnuclei, preventing them from sending signals to themotor cortex. The result is a loss of movement (motoractivity), a characteristic of Parkinson’s.\nIn contrast, cell loss in early Huntington’s disease\ndecreases blocking of signals from the thalamic nuclei,causing more cortex stimulation and stronger but uncon-trolled movements.\nDisruptions in other portions of the basal ganglia are\nthought to cause tics, tremors , dystonia, and a variety of\nother movement disorders, although the exact mecha-nisms are not well understood.\nSome movement disorders, including Huntington’s\ndisease and inherited ataxias, are caused by inheritedgenetic defects. Some diseases that cause sustained mus-cle contraction limited to a particular muscle group(focal dystonia) are inherited, but others are caused bytrauma. The cause of most cases of Parkinson’s disease isunknown, although genes have been found for somefamilial forms.\nSymptoms\nAbnormal movements are broadly classified as\neither hyperkinetic—too much movement—or hypoki-netic—too little movement. Hyperkinetic movementsinclude:\n• Dystonia. Sustained muscle contractions, often causing\ntwisting or repetitive movements and abnormal pos-tures. Dystonia may be limited to one area (focal) ormay affect the whole body (general). Focal dystoniasmay affect the neck (cervical dystonia or torticollis ),\nthe face (one-sided or hemifacial spasm, contraction ofthe eyelid or blepharospasm, contraction of the mouthand jaw or oromandibular dystonia, simultaneousspasm of the chin and eyelid or Meige syndrome), thevocal cords (laryngeal dystonia), or the arms and legs(writer’s cramp, occupational cramps). Dystonia maybe painful as well as incapacitating.• Tremor. Uncontrollable (involuntary) shaking of a body\npart. Tremor may occur only when muscles are relaxedor it may occur only during an action or holding anactive posture.\n• Tics. Involuntary, rapid, nonrhythmic movement or\nsound. Tics can be controlled briefly.\n• Myoclonus. A sudden, shock-like muscle contraction.\nMyoclonic jerks may occur singly or repetitively. Unliketics, myoclonus cannot be controlled even briefly.\n• Chorea. Rapid, nonrhythmic, usually jerky movements,\nmost often in the arms and legs.\n• Ballism. Like chorea, but the movements are much larg-\ner, more explosive and involve more of the arm or leg.This condition, also called ballismus, can occur on bothsides of the body or on one side only (hemiballismus).\n• Akathisia. Restlessness and a desire to move to relieve\nuncomfortable sensations. Sensations may include afeeling of crawling, itching , stretching, or creeping,\nusually in the legs.\n• Athetosis. Slow, writhing, continuous, uncontrollable\nmovement of the arms and legs.\nHypokinetic movements include:\n• Bradykinesia. Slowness of movement.\n• Freezing. Inability to begin a movement or involuntary\nstopping of a movement before it is completed.\n• Rigidity. An increase in muscle tension when an arm or\nleg is moved by an outside force.\n• Postural instability. Loss of ability to maintain upright\nposture caused by slow or absent righting reflexes.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of movement disorders requires a careful\nmedical history and a thorough physical and neurologicalexamination. Brain imaging studies are usually per-formed. Imaging techniques include computed tomogra-phy scan (CT scan), positron emission tomography\n(PET ), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\nRoutine blood and urine analyses are performed. A lum-bar puncture (spinal tap) may be necessary. Videorecording of the abnormal movement is often used toanalyze movement patterns and to track progress of thedisorder and its treatment. Genetic testing is available\nfor some forms of movement disorders.\nTreatment\nTreatment of a movement disorder begins with deter-\nmining its cause. Physical and occupational therapy mayhelp make up for lost control and strength. Drug therapycan help compensate for some imbalances of the basal\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2222Movement disordersganglionic circuit.

    "content": "Movement therapy\nDefinition\nMovement therapy refers to a broad range of Eastern\nand Western movement approaches used to promotephysical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being.\nPurpose\nThe physical benefits of movement therapy include\ngreater ease and range of movement, increased balance,strength and flexibility, improved muscle tone and coor-dination, joint resiliency, cardiovascular conditioning,enhanced athletic performance, stimulation of circula-tion, prevention of injuries, greater longevity, pain relief,\nand relief of rheumatic, neurological, spinal, stress , and\nrespiratory disorders. Movement therapy can also beused as a meditation practice to quiet the mind, foster\nself-knowledge, and increase awareness. In addition,movement therapy is beneficial in alleviating emotionaldistress that is expressed through the body. These condi-tions include eating disorders, excessive clinging, andanxiety attacks. Since movements are related to thoughts\nand feelings, movement therapy can also bring aboutchanges in attitude and emotions. People report anincrease in self-esteem and self-image. Communicationskills can be enhanced and tolerance of others increased.The physical openness facilitated by movement therapyleads to greater emotional openness and creativity.\nDescription\nOrigins\nMovement is fundamental to human life. In fact\nmovement is life. Contemporary physics tells us that theuniverse and everything in it is in constant motion. Wecan move our body and at the most basic level our bodyis movement. According to the somatic educator ThomasHanna, “The living body is a moving body—indeed, it isa constantly moving body.” The poet and philosopherAlan Watts eloquently states a similar view, “A livingbody is not a fixed thing but a flowing event, like a flameor a whirlpool.” Centuries earlier, the great Westernphilosopher Socrates understood what modern physicshas proven, “The universe is motion and nothing else.”\nSince the beginning of time, indigenous societies\naround the world have used movement and dance forindividual and community healing. Movement and songwere used for personal healing, to create community, toensure successful crops, and to promote fertility. Move-ment is still an essential part of many healing traditionsand practices throughout the world.\nWestern movement therapies generally developed out\nof the realm of dance. Many of these movement approach-es were created by former dancers or choreographers whowere searching for a way to prevent injury, attempting torecover from an injury, or who were curious about theeffects of new ways of moving. Some movement therapiesarose out of the fields of physical therapy, psychology, andbodywork. Other movement therapies were developed asway to treat an incurable disease or condition.\nEastern movement therapies, such as yoga ,qigong ,\nand t’ai chi began as a spiritual or self-defense practices\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2224Movement therapyand evolved into healing therapies. In China, for exam-\nple, Taoist monks learned to use specific breathing andmovement patterns in order to promote mental clarity,physical strength, and support their practice of medita-tion. These practices, later known as qigong and t’ai chieventually became recognized as ways to increase healthand prolong life.\nThere are countless approaches to movement thera-\npy. Some approaches emphasize awareness and attentionto inner sensations. Other approaches use movement as aform of psychotherapy, expressing and working throughdeep emotional issues. Some approaches emphasizealignment with gravity and specific movement sequences,while other approaches encourage spontaneous move-ment. Some approaches are primarily concerned withincreasing the ease and efficiency of bodily movement.Other approaches address the reality of the body “asmovement” instead of the body as only something thatruns or walks through space.\nThe term movement therapy is often associated with\ndance therapy. Some dance therapists work privatelywith people who are interested in personal growth. Oth-ers work in mental health settings with autistic, braininjured and learning disabled children, the elderly, anddisabled adults.\nLaban movement analysis (LMA), formerly known as\nEffort-Shape is a comprehensive system for discriminat-ing, describing, analyzing, and categorizing movements.LMA can be applied to dance, athletic coaching, fitness,acting, psychotherapy, and a variety of other professions.Certified movement analysts can “observe recurring pat-terns, note movement preferences, asses physical blocksand dysfunctional movement patterns, and then suggestnew movement patterns.” As a student of Rudolf Laban,Irmgard Bartenieff developed his form of movementanalysis into a system of body training or reeducationcalled Bartenieff fundamentals (BF). The basic premise ofthis work is that once the student experiences a physicalfoundation, emotional, and intellectual expression becomericher. BF uses specific exercises that are practiced on thefloor, sitting, or standing to engage the deeper muscles ofthe body and enable a greater range of movement.\nAuthentic movement (AM) is based upon Mary\nStarks Whitehouse’s understanding of dance, movement,and depth psychology. There is no movement instructionin AM, simply a mover and a witness. The mover waitsand listens for an impulse to move and then follows or“moves with” the spontaneous movements that arise.These movements may or may not be visible to the wit-ness. The movements may be in response to an emotion,a dream, a thought, pain, joy, or whatever is being experi-enced in the moment. The witness serves as a compas-sionate, non judgmental mirror and brings a “special\nquality of attention or presence.” At the end of the ses-sion the mover and witness speak about their experiencestogether. AM is a powerful approach for self develop-ment and awareness and provides access to preverbalmemories, creative ideas, and unconscious movementpatterns that limit growth.\nGabrielle Roth (5 Rhythms movement) and Anna\nHalprin have both developed dynamic movement prac-tices that emphasize personal growth, awareness, expres-sion, and community. Although fundamentally differentforms, each of these movement/dance approaches recog-nize and encourage our inherent desire for movement.\nSeveral forms of movement therapy grew out of spe-\ncific bodywork modalities. Rolfing movement integra-\ntion (RMI) and Rolfing rhythms are movement formswhich reinforce and help to integrate the structural bodychanges brought about by the hands-on work of Rolfing(structural integration). RMI uses a combination of touchand verbal directions to help develop greater awarenessof one’s vertical alignment and habitual movement pat-terns. RMI teacher Mary Bond says, “The premise ofRolfing Movement Integration... is that you can restoreyour structure to balance by changing the movementhabits that perpetuate imbalance.” Rolfing rhythms is aseries of lively exercises designed to encourage aware-ness of the Rolfing principles of ease, length, balance,and harmony with gravity.\nThe movement education component of Aston-Pat-\nterning bodywork is called neurokinetics. This move-\nment therapy teaches ways of moving with greater easethroughout every day activities. These movement pat-terns can also be used to release tension in the body.Aston fitness is an exercise program which includes\nwarm-up techniques, exercises to increase muscle toneand stability, stretching, and cardiovascular fitness.\nRosen method movement (an adjunct to Rosen\nmethod bodywork) consists of simple fun movementexercises done to music in a group setting. Through gen-tle swinging, bouncing, and stretching every joint in thebody experiences a full range of movement. The move-ments help to increase balance and rhythm and createmore space for effortless breathing.\nThe movement form of Trager psychophysical\nIntegration bodywork, Mentastics, consists of fun, easy\nswinging, shaking, and stretching movements. Thesemovements, developed by Dr. Milton Trager, create anexperience of lightness and freedom in the body, allow-ing for greater ease in movement. Trager also workedsuccessfully with polio patients.\nAwareness through movement, the movement thera-\npy form of the Feldenkrais method , consists of specific\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2225Movement therapystructured movement experiences taught as a group les-\nson. These lessons reeducate the brain without tiring themuscles. Most lessons are done lying down on the flooror sitting. Moshe Feldenkrais designed the lessons to“improve ability... turn the impossible into the possible,the difficult into the easy, and the easy into the pleasant.”\nIdeokinesis is another movement approach empha-\nsizing neuromuscular reeducation. Lulu Sweigart basedher work on the pioneering approach of her teacherMabel Elsworth Todd. Ideokinesis uses imagery to trainthe nervous system to stimulate the right muscles for theintended movement. If one continues to give the nervoussystem a clear mental picture of the movement intended,it will automatically select the best way to perform themovement. For example, to enhance balance in standing,Sweigart taught people to visualize “lines of movement”traveling through their bodies. Sweigart did not trainteachers in ideokinesis but some individuals use ideoki-netic imagery in the process of teaching movement.\nThe Mensendieck system of functional movement\ntechniques is both corrective and preventative. BessMensendieck, a medical doctor, developed a series ofexercises to reshape, rebuild and revitalize the body. Astudent of this approach learns to use the conscious willto relax muscles and release tension. There are more than200 exercises that emphasize correct and graceful bodymovement through everyday activities. Unlike othermovement therapy approaches this work is doneundressed or in a bikini bottom, in front of mirrors. Thisallows the student to observe and feel where a movementoriginates. Success has been reported with many condi-tions including Parkinson’s disease , muscle and joint\ninjuries, and repetitive strain injuries.\nThe Alexander technique is another functional\napproach to movement therapy. In this approach ateacher gently uses hands and verbal directions to subtlyguide the student through movements such as sitting,standing up, bending and walking. The Alexander tech-nique emphasizes balance in the neck-head relationship.A teacher lightly steers the students head into the properbalance on the tip of the spine while the student is mov-ing in ordinary ways. The student learns to respond tomovement demands with the whole body, in a light inte-grated way. This approach to movement is particularlypopular with actors and other performers.\nPilates or physical mind method is also popular with\nactors, dancers, athletes, and a broad range of other peo-ple. Pilates consists of over 500 exercises done on thefloor or primarily with customized exercise equipment.The exercises combine sensory awareness and physicaltraining. Students learn to move from a stable, centralcore. The exercises promote strength, flexibility, and bal-ance. Pilates training is increasingly available in sports\nmedicine clinics, fitness centers, dance schools, spas, andphysical therapy offices.\nMany approaches to movement therapy emphasize\nawareness of internal sensations. Charlotte Selver, a stu-dent of somatic pioneer Elsa Gindler, calls her style ofteaching sensory awareness (SA). This approach hasinfluenced the thinking of many innovators, includingFritz Perls, who developed gestalt therapy . Rather than\nsuggesting a series of structured movements, visualiza-tions, or body positions, in SA the teacher outlines exper-iments in which one can become aware of the sensationsinvolved in any movement. A teacher might ask the stu-dent to feel the movement of her breathing while run-ning, sitting, picking up a book, etc. This close attune-ment to inner sensory experience encourages an experi-ence of body-mind unity in which breathing becomesless restricted and posture, coordination, flexibility, andbalance are improved. There may also be the experienceof increased energy and aliveness.\nGerda Alexander Eutony (GAE) is another move-\nment therapy approach that is based upon internal aware-ness. Through GAE one becomes a master of self-sens-ing and knowing which includes becoming sensitive tothe external environment, as well. For example, whilelying on the floor sensing the breath, skin or form of thebody, one also senses the connection with the ground.GAE is taught in group classes or private lessons whichalso include hands-on therapy. In 1987, after two years ofobservation in clinics throughout the world, GAEbecame the first mind-body discipline accepted by theWorld Health Organization (WHO) as an alternativehealthcare technique.\nKinetic awareness developed by dancer-choreograph-\ner Elaine Summers, emphasizes emotional and physicalinquiry. Privately or in a group, a teacher sets up situationsfor the student to explore the possible causes of pain andmovement restrictions within the body. Rubber balls ofvarious sizes are used as props to focus attention inward,support the body in a stretched position and massage aspecific area of the body. The work helps one to deal withchronic pain, move easily again after injuries and increaseenergy, flexibility, coordination, and comfort.\nBody-mind centering (BMC) was developed by\nBonnie Bainbridge Cohen and is a comprehensive educa-tional and therapeutic approach to movement. BMCpractitioners use movement, touch, guided imagery ,\ndevelopmental repatterning, dialogue, music, large balls,and other props in an individual session to meet theneeds of each person. BMC encourages people to devel-op a sensate awareness and experience of the ligaments,nerves, muscles, skin, fluids, organs, glands, fat, and fas-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2226Movement therapycia that make up one’s body. It has been effective in pre-\nventing and rehabilitating from chronic injuries and inimproving neuromuscular response in children withcerebral palsy and other neurological disorders.\nContinuum movement has also been shown to be\neffective in treating neurological disorders includingspinal chord injury. Developed by Emilie Conrad andSusan Harper, continuum movement is an inquiry intothe creative flux of our body and all of life. Sound,breath, subtle and dynamic movements are explored thatstimulate the brain and increase resonance with the fluidworld of movement. The emphasis is upon unpredictable,spontaneous or spiral movements rather than a linearmovement pattern. According to Conrad, “Awarenesschanges how we physically move. As we become morefluid and resilient so do the mental, emotional, and spiri-tual movements of our lives.”\nEastern movement therapies such as yoga, t’ai chi,\nand qigong are also effective in healing and preventing awide range of physical disorders, encouraging emotionalstability, and enhancing spiritual awareness. There are anumber of different approaches to yoga. Some empha-size the development of physical strength, flexibility, andalignment. Other forms of yoga emphasize inner aware-ness, opening, and meditation.\nPrecautions\nPeople with acute injuries and chronic physical and\nmental conditions need to be careful when choosing aform of movement therapy. It is best to consult with aknowledgeable physician, physical therapist, or mentalhealth therapist.\nResearch and general acceptance\nAlthough research has documented the effects of\ndance therapy, qigong, t’ai chi, yoga, Alexander tech-nique, awareness through movement (Feldenkrais), andRolfing movement, other forms of movement therapyhave not been as thoroughly researched.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHalprin, Anna.

    "title": "Mucopolysaccharidoses",
    "content": "Mucopolysaccharidoses\nDefinition\nMucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a general term for\na number of inherited diseases that are caused by theaccumulation of mucopolysaccharides, resulting in prob-lems with an individual’s development. With each condi-tion, mucopolysaccharides accumulate in the cells andtissues of the body because of a deficiency of a specificenzyme. The specific enzyme that is deficient or absentis what distinguishes one type of MPS from another.However, before these enzymes were identified, the MPSdisorders were diagnosed by the signs and symptoms thatan individual expressed. The discovery of these enzymesresulted in a reclassification of some of the MPS disor-ders. These conditions are often referred to as MPS I,MPS II, MPS III, MPS IV , MPS VI, MPS VII, and MPSIX. However, these conditions are also referred to bytheir original names, which are Hurler, Hurler-Scheie,Scheie (all MPS I), Hunter (MPS II), Sanfilippo (MPSIII), Morquio (MPS IV), Maroteaux-Lamy (MPS VI),Sly (MPS VII), and Hyaluronidase deficiency (MPS IX).\nDescription\nMucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar mole-\ncules that are essential for building the bones, cartilage,skin, tendons, and other tissues in the body. Normally,the human body continuously breaks down and buildsmucopolysaccharides. Another name for mucopolysac-charides is glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). There are manydifferent types of GAGs and specific GAGs are unable tobe broken down in each of the MPS conditions. There areseveral enzymes involved in breaking down each GAGand a deficiency or absence of any of the essential\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2227Mucopolysaccharidosesenzymes can cause the GAG to not be broken down com-\npletely and result in its accumulation in the tissues andorgans in the body. In some MPS conditions, in additionto the GAG being stored in the body, some of the incom-pletely broken down GAGs can leave the body via theurine. When too much GAG is stored, organs and tissuescan be damaged or not function properly.\nGenetic profile\nExcept for MPS II, the MPS conditions are inherited\nin an autosomal recessive manner. MPS conditions occurwhen both of an individual’s genes that produce the spe-cific enzyme contain a mutation, causing them to notwork properly. When both genes do not work properly,either none or a reduced amount of the enzyme is pro-duced. An individual with an autosomal recessive condi-tion inherits one of those non-working genes from eachparent. These parents are called “carriers” of the condi-tion. When two people are known carriers for an autoso-mal recessive condition, they have a 25% chance witheach pregnancy to have a child affected with the disease.\nSome individuals with MPS do have children of theirown. Children of parents who have an autosomal reces-sive condition are all carriers of that condition. Thesechildren are not at risk to develop the condition unlessthe other parent is a carrier or affected with the sameautosomal recessive condition.\nUnlike the other MPS conditions, MPS II is inherit-\ned in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that thegene causing the condition is located on the X chromo-some, one of the two sex chromosomes. Since a male hasonly one X chromosome, he will have the disease if theX chromosome inherited from his mother carries thedefective gene. Females, because they have two X chro-mosomes, are called “carriers” of the condition if onlyone of their X chromosomes has the gene that causes thecondition, while the other X chromosome does not.\nCauses and symptoms\nEach type of MPS is caused by a deficiency of one of\nthe enzymes involved in breaking down GAGs. It is theaccumulation of the GAGs in the tissues and organs in thebody that cause the wide array of symptoms characteristicof the MPS conditions. The accumulating material isstored in cellular structures called lysosomes, and thesedisorders are also known as lysosomal storage diseases.\nMPS I\nMPS I is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme\nalpha-L-iduronidase. Three conditions, Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes, all are caused by a defi-ciency of this enzyme. Initially, these three conditionswere felt to be separate because each were associated\nwith different physical symptoms and prognoses. How-ever, once the underlying cause of these conditions wasidentified, it was realized that these three conditions wereall variants of the same disorder. The gene involved withMPS I is located on chromosome 4p16.3.\nMPS I H (HURLER SYNDROME). It has been estimated\nthat approximately one baby in 100,000 will be bornwith Hurler syndrome. Individuals with Hurler syndrometend to have the most severe form of MPS I. Symptomsof Hurler syndrome are often evident within the first yearor two after birth. Often these infants begin to develop asexpected, but then reach a point where they begin toloose the skills that they have learned. Many of theseinfants may initially grow faster than expected, but theirgrowth slows and typically stops by age three. Facial fea-tures also begin to appear “coarse.” They develop a shortnose, flatter face, thicker skin, and a protruding tongue.Additionally, their heads become larger and they developmore hair on their bodies with the hair becoming coarser.Their bones are also affected, with these children usuallydeveloping joint contractures (stiff joints), kyphosis (a\nspecific type of curve to the spine), and broad hands withshort fingers. Many of these children experience breath-ing difficulties, and respiratory infections are common.Other common problems include heart valve dysfunc-tion, thickening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy),enlarged spleen and liver, clouding of the cornea, hear-\ning loss , and carpal tunnel syndrome . These children\ntypically do not live past age 12.\nMPS I H/S (HURLER-SCHEIE SYNDROME). Hurler-\nScheie syndrome is felt to be the intermediate form ofMPS I, meaning that the symptoms are not as severe asthose in individuals who have MPS I H but not as mild asthose in MPS I S. Approximately one baby in 115,000will be born with Hurler-Scheie syndrome. These indi-viduals tend to be shorter than expected, and they canhave normal intelligence, however, some individualswith MPS I H/S will experience learning difficulties.These individuals may develop some of the same physi-cal features as those with Hurler syndrome, but usuallythey are not as severe. The prognosis for children withMPS I H/S is variable with some individuals dying dur-ing childhood, while others live to adulthood.\nMPS I S (SCHEIE SYNDROME). Scheie syndrome is\nconsidered the mild form of MPS I. It is estimated thatapproximately one baby in 500,000 will be born withScheie syndrome. Individuals with MPS I S usually havenormal intelligence, but there have been some reports ofindividuals with MPS I S developing psychiatric prob-lems. Common physical problems include corneal cloud-ing, heart abnormalities, and orthopedic difficulties\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2228Mucopolysaccharidosesinvolving their hands and back. Individuals with MPS I S\ndo not develop the facial features seen with MPS I H andusually these individuals have a normal life span.\nMPS II (Hunter syndrome)\nHunter syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the\nenzyme iduronate-2-sulphatase. All individuals withHunter syndrome are male, because the gene that causesthe condition is located on the X chromosome, specifi-cally Xq28. Like many MPS conditions, Hunter syn-drome is divided into two groups, mild and severe. It hasbeen estimated that approximately 1 in 110,000 malesare born with Hunter syndrome, with the severe formbeing three times more common than the mild form. Thesevere form is felt to be associated with progressivemental retardation and physical disability, with most\nindividuals dying before age 15. In the milder form, mostof these individuals live to adulthood and have normalintelligence or only mild mental impairments. Maleswith the mild form of Hunter syndrome develop physicaldifferences similar to the males with the severe form, butnot as quickly. Men with mild Hunter syndrome can havea normal life span and some have had children. Mostmales with Hunter syndrome develop joint stiffness,chronic diarrhea , enlarged liver and spleen, heart valve\nproblems, hearing loss, kyphosis, and tend to be shorterthan expected. These symptoms tend to progress at a dif-ferent rate depending on if an individual has the mild orsevere form of MPS II.\nMPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome)\nMPS III, like the other MPS conditions, was initially\ndiagnosed by the individual having certain physical char-acteristics. It was later discovered that the physicalsymptoms associated with Sanfilippo syndrome could becaused by a deficiency in one of four enzymes. Each typeof MPS III is now subdivided into four groups, labeledA-D, based on the specific enzyme that is deficient. Allfour of these enzymes are involved in breaking down thesame GAG, heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate is mainlyfound in the central nervous system and accumulates inthe brain when it cannot be broken down because one ofthose four enzymes are deficient or missing.\nMPS III is a variable condition with symptoms\nbeginning to appear between ages two and six years ofage. Because of the accumulation of heparan sulfate inthe central nervous system, the central nervous system isseverely affected. In MPS III, signs that the central ner-vous system is degenerating usually are evident in mostindividuals between ages six and 10. Many children withMPS III will develop seizures, sleeplessness, thickerskin, joint contractures, enlarged tongues, cardiomyopa-thy, behavior problems, and mental retardation. The life\nexpectancy in MPS III is also variable. On average, indi-viduals with MPS III live until they are teenagers, withsome living longer and others not that long.\nMPS IIIA (SANFILIPPO SYNDROME TYPE A). MPS\nIIIA is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme heparan N-sulfatase. Type IIIA is felt to be the most severe of thefour types, in which symptoms appear and death occurs\nat an earlier age. A study in British Columbia estimatedthat one in 324,617 live births are born with MPS IIIA.MPS IIIA is the most common of the four types inNorthwestern Europe. The gene that causes MPS IIIA islocated on the long arm of chromosome 17 (location17q25).\nMPS IIIB (SANFILIPPO SYNDROME TYPE B). MPS IIIB\nis due to a deficiency in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glu-cosaminidase (NAG). This type of MPS III is not felt tobe as severe as Type IIIA and the characteristics vary.Type IIIB is the most common of the four in southeasternEurope. The gene associated with MPS IIIB is also locat-ed on the long arm of chromosome 17 (location 17q21).\nMPS IIIC (SANFILIPPO SYNDROME TYPE C). A defi-\nciency in the enzyme acetyl-CoA-alpha-glucosaminideacetyltransferase causes MPS IIIC. This is considered arare form of MPS III. The gene involved in MPS IIIC isbelieved to be located on chromosome 14.\nMPS IIID (SANFILIPPO SYNDROME TYPE D). MPS\nIIID is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-sulfatase. This form of MPS III is alsorare. The gene involved in MPS IIID is located on thelong arm of chromosome 12 (location 12q14).\nMPS IV (Morquio syndrome)\nAs with several of the MPS disorders, Morquio syn-\ndrome was diagnosed by the presence of particular signsand symptoms. However, it is now known that the deficien-cy of two different enzymes can cause the characteristics ofMPS IV . These two types of MPS IV are called MPS IV Aand MPS IV B. MPS IV is also variable in its severity. Theintelligence of individuals with MPS IV is often complete-ly normal. In individuals with a severe form, skeletalabnormalities can be extreme and include dwarfism,kyphosis (backward-curved spine), prominent breastbone,flat feet, and knock-knees. One of the earliest symptomsseen in this condition usually is a difference in the way thechild walks. In individuals with a mild form of MPS IV ,limb stiffness, and joint pain are the primary symptoms.\nMPS IV is one of the rarest MPS disorders, with approxi-mately one baby in 300,000 born with this condition.\nMPS IV A (MORQUIO SYNDROME TYPE A). MPS IV\nA is the “classic” or the severe form of the condition and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2229Mucopolysaccharidosesis caused by a deficiency in the enzyme galactosamine-6-\nsulphatase. The gene involved with MPS IV A is locatedon the long arm of chromosome 16 (location 16q24.3).\nMPS IV B (MORQUIO SYNDROME TYPE B). MPS IV B\nis considered the milder form of the condition. Theenzyme, beta-galactosidase, is deficient in MPS IV B. Thelocation of the gene that produces beta-galactosidase islocated on the short arm of chromosome 3 (location 3p21).\nMPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome)\nMPS VI, which is another rare form of MPS, is\ncaused by a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylglu-cosamine-4-sulphatase. This condition is also variable;individuals may have a mild or severe form of the condi-tion. Typically, the nervous system or intelligence of anindividual with MPS VI is not affected. Individuals witha more severe form of MPS VI can have airway obstruc-tion, develop hydrocephalus (extra fluid accumulating\nin the brain) and have bone changes. Additionally, indi-viduals with a severe form of MPS VI are more likely todie while in their teens. With a milder form of the condi-tion, individuals tend to be shorter than expected for theirage, develop corneal clouding, and live longer. The geneKEY TERMS\nCardiomyopathy —A thickening of the heart mus-\ncle.\nEnzyme —A protein that catalyzes a biochemical\nreaction or change without changing its ownstructure or function.\nJoint contractures —Stiffness of the joints that pre-\nvents full extension.\nKyphosis —An abnormal outward curvature of the\nspine, with a hump at the upper back.\nLysosome —Membrane-enclosed compartment in\ncells, containing many hydrolytic enzymes; wherelarge molecules and cellular components are bro-ken down.\nMucopolysaccharide —A complex molecule made\nof smaller sugar molecules strung together to forma chain.

It is also highly variable, but symptoms aregenerally similar to those seen in individuals with Hurlersyndrome. The gene that causes MPS VII is located onthe long arm of chromosome 7 (location 7q21).\nMPS IX (Hyaluronidase deficiency)\nMPS IX is a condition that was first described in\n1996 and has been grouped with the other MPS condi-tions by some researchers. MPS IX is caused by the defi-ciency of the enzyme hyaluronidase. In the few individu-als described with this condition, the symptoms are vari-able, but some develop soft-tissue masses (growths underthe skin). Also, these individuals are shorter than expect-ed for their age. The gene involved in MPS IX is believedto be located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (possibly3p21.3-21.2)\nMany individuals with an MPS condition have prob-\nlems with airway constriction. This constriction may beso serious as to create significant difficulties in adminis-tering general anesthesia. Therefore, it is recommendedthat surgical procedures be performed under local anes-thesia whenever possible.\nDiagnosis\nWhile a diagnosis for each type of MPS can be\nmade on the basis of the physical signs describedabove, several of the conditions have similar features.Therefore, enzyme analysis is used to determine thespecific MPS disorder. Enzyme analysis usually can-not accurately determine if an individual is a carrierfor a MPS condition. This is because the enzyme lev-els in individuals who are not carriers overlaps theenzyme levels seen in those individuals who are carri-er for a MPS. With many of the MPS conditions, sev-eral mutations have been found in each gene involvedthat can cause symptoms of each condition. If the spe-cific mutation is known in a family, DNA analysismay be possible.\nOnce a couple has had a child with an MPS condi-\ntion, prenatal diagnosis is available to them to help deter-mine if a fetus is affected with the same MPS as theirother child. This can be accomplished through testingsamples using procedures such as an amniocentesis or\nchorionic villus sampling (CVS). Each of these proce-\ndures has its own risks, benefits, and limitations.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2230MucopolysaccharidosesTreatment\nThere is no cure for mucopolysaccharidosis. There\nare several types of experimental therapies that are beinginvestigated. Typically, treatment involves trying to relievesome of the symptoms. For MPS I and VI, bone marrow\ntransplantation has been attempted as a treatment option.\nIn those conditions, bone marrow transplantation hassometimes been found to help slow down the progressionor reverse some symptoms of the disorder in some chil-dren. The benefits of a bone marrow transplantation aremore likely to be noticed when performed on childrenunder two years of age. However it is not certain that abone marrow transplant can prevent further damage to cer-tain organs and tissues, including the brain. Furthermore,bone marrow transplantation is not felt to be helpful insome MPS disorders and there are risks, benefits, and lim-itations with this procedure. In 2000, 10 individuals withMPS I received recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidaseevery week for one year. Those individuals showed animprovement with some of their symptoms. Additionally,there is ongoing research involving gene replacement ther-apy (the insertion of normal copies of a gene into the cellsof patients whose gene copies are defective).\nPrevention\nNo specific preventive measures are available for\ngenetic diseases of this type. For some of the MPS dis-eases, biochemical tests are available that will identifyhealthy individuals who are carriers of the defectivegene, allowing them to make informed reproductive deci-sions. There is also the availability of prenatal diagnosisfor all MPS disease to detect affected fetuses.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nBax, Martin C.O. and Gillian A.

    "content": "Mucormycosis\nDefinition\nMucormycosis is a rare but often fatal disease\ncaused by certain fungi. It is sometimes called zygomy-cosis or phycomycosis. Mucormycosis is an opportunis-tic infection that typically develops in patients withweakened immune systems, diabetes, kidney failure,organ transplants, or chemotherapy .\nDescription\nIn the United States, mucormycosis is most likely to\ndevelop in the patient’s nasal area or in the lungs.\nRhinocerebral mucormycosis\nRhinocerebral mucormycosis is an infection of the\nnose, eyes, and brain. The fungus destroys the tissue ofthe nasal passages, sinuses, or hard palate, producing ablack discharge and visible patches of dying tissue. The\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2231Mucormycosisfungus then invades the tissues around the eye socket and\neventually the brain.\nPulmonary mucormycosis\nMost patients with the pulmonary form of the dis-\nease are being treated for leukemia. The fungus entersthe patient’s lungs, where it eventually invades a majorblood vessel, causing the patient to cough up blood or\nhemorrhage into the lungs.\nCauses and symptoms\nMucormycosis is caused by fungi of several differ-\nent species, including Mucor ,Rhizopus ,Absidia , and\nRhizomucor . When these organisms gain access to the\nmucous membranes of the patient’s nose or lungs, theymultiply rapidly and invade the nearby blood vessels.The fungi destroy soft tissue and bone, as well as thewalls of blood vessels.\nThe early symptoms of rhinocerebral mucormycosis\ninclude fever , sinus pain ,headache , and cellulitis . As\nthe fungus reaches the eye tissues, the patient developsdilated pupils, drooping eyelids, a bulging eye, and even-tually hemorrhage of the blood vessels in the brain—causing convulsions, partial paralysis , and death .\nThe symptoms of pulmonary mucormycosis include\nfever and difficulty breathing, with eventual bleedingfrom the lungs.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is usually based on a combination of the\npatient’s medical history and a visual examination of thenose and throat. The doctor will take a tissue sample forbiopsy, or a PAS, potassium hydroxide (KOH), or Calco-fluor stain in order to make a tentative diagnosis. Confir-mation requires a laboratory culture.KEY TERMS\nAmphotericin B —An antibiotic used to treat\nmucormycosis and other severe fungal infections.\nOpportunistic infection —An infection that devel-\nops only when a person’s immune system is weak-ened.\nOrbit —The bony cavity or socket surrounding the\neye.\nZygomycosis —Another term for mucormycosis.\nThe fungi that cause mucormycosis belong to agroup called Zygomycetes.Imaging studies are not needed to make the diagno-\nsis. If the patient has mucormycosis, however, magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography\nscans (CT scans) will usually show the destruction of\nsoft tissue or bone in patients with advanced disease.Chest x rays will sometimes show a cavity in the lung oran area filled with tissue fluid if the patient has pul-monary mucormycosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment is usually begun without waiting for labo-\nratory reports because of the rapid spread and high mor-tality rate of the disease. It includes intravenous ampho-tericin B (Fungizone); surgical removal of infected tis-sue; and careful monitoring of the disorder or conditionthat is responsible for the patient’s vulnerability.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for recovery from mucormycosis is\npoor. The mortality rate is 30%-50% of patients with therhinocerebral form, and even higher for patients withpulmonary mucormycosis. The disease is almost 100%fatal for patients with AIDS .\nPrevention\nPrevention depends on protecting high-risk patients\nfrom contact with sugary foods, decaying plants, moldybread, manure, and other breeding grounds for fungi.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBeavis, Kathleen G. “Systemic Mycoses.” In Current Diagno-\nsis.V ol. 9.

It can beordered in the following patients:\n• with known or suspected coronary artery disease ,t o\ndiagnose the disease and predict outcomes\n• with lesions in their heart valves\n• who have recently had a heart attack , to assess dam-\nage to heart tissue and predict the likelihood of futurecardiac events\n• with congestive heart failure\n• who have undergone percutaneous transluminal coro-\nnary angioplasty ,coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery , or medical therapy, to assess the efficacy of the\ntreatment\n• with low cardiac output after open-heart surgery• who are undergoing chemotherapy\nPrecautions\nPregnant women and those who are breastfeeding\nshould not be exposed to technetium.\nDescription\nThe MUGA scan measures the heart’s function and\nthe flow of blood through it. The strongest chamber in theheart is the left ventricle, which serves as the main pumpof blood through the body. The left ventricular is assessedby measuring the amount of blood pumped with eachheartbeat (the ejection fraction), ventricle filling, and theblood flow into the pumping chamber. A normal ejectionfraction is 50% or more. The heart’s ejection fraction isone of the most important measures of its performance.The right ventricle’s ability to pump blood to the lungs isalso assessed, and any abnormalities in the heart wall areidentified. The MUGA scan is the most accurate, non-invasive test available to assess the heart’s ventricles.\nMUGA is a nuclear heart scan, which means that it\ninvolves the use of a radioactive isotope that targets theheart and a radionuclide detector that traces the absorp-tion of the radioactive isotope. The isotope is injectedinto a vein and absorbed by healthy tissue at a knownrate during a certain time period. The radionuclide detec-tor, in this case a gamma scintillation camera, picks upthe gamma rays emitted by the isotope.\nDuring the MUGA scan, electrodes are placed on\nthe patient’s body so that an electrocardiogram (ECG)can be conducted. The imaging equipment and computerare synchronized with the ECG so that images of theheart can be recorded without motion or blur. Then asmall amount of a mildly radioactive isotope called tech-netium Tc99m stannous pyrophosphate, usually calledtechnetium, is injected, usually into an arm vein. Whilethe patient lies motionless on the test table, a gammascintillation camera follows the movement of the tech-netium through the blood circulating in the heart. Thecamera, which looks like an x-ray machine and is sus-pended above the table, moves back and forth over thepatient. It displays multiple images of the heart in motionand records them on a computer for later analysis.\nThe MUGA scan is usually performed in a hospital’s\nnuclear medicine department, but it can also be per-formed in an outpatient facility or at the patient’s bedsideif equipment is available. The scan is done immediatelyafter injection of the technetium and usually takes about30 minutes to one hour. It is also called multigated graftacquisition, multigated acquisition scan, cardiac blood-pool imaging, and equilibrium radionuclide angiogra-\nphy. Test results can be affected by patient movement\nduring the test, electrocardiogram abnormalities, anirregular heartbeat, or long-acting nitrates.\nThe MUGA scan can be done with the patient at rest\nor exercising (called a stress MUGA). The stress MUGA\nis often performed in patients who have or are suspectedof having coronary artery disease. The resting MUGA iscompared to the stress MUGA and changes in the heart’spumping performance are analyzed. In some cases, therest MUGA is compared to a nitroglycerin MUGA, inwhich a strong heart drug called nitroglycerin is adminis-tered to the patient before the scan. For the nitroglycerinMUGA, a cardiologist should be present.\nThe MUGA scan is not dangerous. The technetium\nis completely gone from the body within a few days ofthe test. The scan itself exposes the patient to about thesame amount of radiation as a chest x ray . The patient\ncan resume normal activities immediately after the test.\nNormal results\nIf the patient’s heart is normal, the technetium will\nappear to be evenly distributed in the scans. In a stress\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2233Multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scanMUGA, patients with normal hearts will exhibit an\nincrease in ejection fraction or no change.\nAbnormal results\nAn uneven distribution of technetium in the heart\nindicates that the patient has coronary artery disease, acardiomyopathy, or blood shunting within the heart.Abnormalities in a resting MUGA usually indicate aheart attack, while those that occur during exercise usu-\nally indicate ischemia . In a stress MUGA, patients with\ncoronary artery disease may exhibit a decrease in ejec-tion fraction.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDeBakey, Michael E., and Antonio M.

    "title": "Multiple chemical sensitivity",
    "content": "Multiple chemical sensitivity\nDefinition\nMultiple chemical sensitivity, also known as MCS\nsyndrome or simply MCS, is a disorder in which a per-son develops symptoms from exposure to chemicals inthe environment. With each incidence of exposure, lowerlevels of the chemical will trigger a reaction and the per-son becomes increasingly vulnerable to reactions trig-gered by other chemicals.\nDescription\nMultiple chemical sensitivity typically begins with\none high-dose exposure to a chemical, but it may alsodevelop with long-term exposure to a low level of achemical. Chemicals most often connected with MCSinclude: formaldehyde; pesticides; solvents; petrochemi-cal fuels such as diesel, gasoline, and kerosene; waxes,detergents, and cleaning products; latex; tobacco smoke;\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2234Multiple chemical sensitivityperfumes and fragrances; and artificial colors, flavors,\nand preservatives. People who develop MCS are com-monly exposed in one of the following situations: on thejob as an industrial worker; residing or working in apoorly ventilated building; or living in conditions of highair or water pollution. Others may be exposed in uniqueincidents.\nBecause MCS is difficult to diagnose, estimates vary\nas to what percentage of the population develops MCS.However, most MCS patients are female. The medianage of MCS patients is 40 years old, and most experi-enced symptoms before they were 30 years old.\nCauses and symptoms\nChemical exposure is often a result of indoor air pol-\nlution. Buildings which are tightly sealed for energy con-servation may cause a related illness called sick buildingsyndrome, in which people develop symptoms fromchronic exposure to airborne environmental chemicalssuch as formaldehyde from the furniture, carpet glues, andlatex caulking. A person moving into a newly constructedbuilding, which has not had time to degas, may experiencethe initial high-dose exposure that leads to MCS.\nThe symptoms of MCS vary from person to person\nand are not chemical-specific. Symptoms are not limitedto one physiological system, but primarily affect the res-piratory and nervous systems. Symptoms commonlyreported are headache ,fatigue , weakness, difficulty\nconcentrating, short-term memory loss, dizziness , irri-\ntability and depression, itching , numbness, burning sen-\nsation, congestion, sore throat , hoarseness, shortness of\nbreath ,cough , and stomach pains.\nDiagnosis\nMultiple chemical sensitivity is a twentieth-century\ndisorder, becoming more prevalent as more man-madechemicals are introduced into the environment in greaterquantities. It is especially difficult to diagnose because itpresents no consistent or measurable set of symptomsand has no single diagnostic test or marker. Physiciansare often unaware of MCS as a condition. They may beunable to diagnose it, or may misdiagnose it as anotherdegenerative disease, or may label it as a psychosomaticillness (a physical illness that is caused by emotionalproblems). Their lack of understanding generates frustra-tion, anxiety , and distrust in patients already struggling\nwith MCS. However, a new specialty of medicine isevolving to address MCS and related illnesses: occupa-tional and environmental medicine. A physician lookingfor MCS will take a complete patient history and try toidentify chemical exposures.KEY TERMS\nDegas —To release and vent gases. New building\nmaterials often give off gases and odors and the airshould be well circulated to remove them.\nSick building syndrome —An illness related to MCS\nin which a person develops symptoms in responseto chronic exposure to airborne environmentalchemicals found in a tightly sealed building.\nTreatment\nWhile doctors may recommend antihistamines ,\nanalgesics , and other medications to combat the symp-\ntoms, the most effective treatment is to avoid thosechemicals which trigger the symptoms. This becomesincreasingly difficult as the number of offending chemi-cals increases, and people with MCS often remain athome where they are able to control the chemicals intheir environment. This isolation often limits their abili-\nties to work and socialize, so supportive counseling mayalso be appropriate.\nAlternative treatment\nSome MCS patients find relief with detoxification\nprograms of exercise and sweating, and chelation of\nheavy metals. Others support their health with nutritionalregimens and immunotherapy vaccines. Some undergofood-allergy testing and testing for accumulated pesti-cides in the body to learn more about their condition andwhat chemicals to avoid. Homeopathy and acupuncture\ncan give added support to any treatment program forMCS patients. Botanical medicine can help to supportthe liver and other involved organs.\nPrognosis\nOnce MCS sets in, sensitivity continues to increase\nand a person’s health continues to deteriorate. Strictlyavoiding exposure to triggering chemicals for a year ormore may improve health.\nPrevention\nMultiple chemical sensitivity is difficult to prevent\nbecause even at high-dose exposures, different people reactdifferently. Ensuring adequate ventilation in situations withpotential for acute high-dose or chronic low-dose chemicalexposure, as well as wearing the proper protective equip-ment in industrial situations, will minimize the risk.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2235Multiple chemical sensitivityResources\nBOOKS\nHu, Howard, and Frank E.

Each is an autosomal domi-nant genetic condition which predisposes to hyperplasia(excessive growth of cells) and tumor formation in anumber of endocrine glands.\nCauses and symptoms\nMEN1 patients experience hyperplasia or tumors of\nseveral endocrine glands, including the parathyroids, thepancreas, and the pituitary. The most frequent symptomof MEN1 is hyperparathyroidism . Overgrowth of the\nparathyroid glands leads to oversecretion of parathyroidhormone, which leads to elevated blood calcium levels,kidney stones , weakened bones, and nervous system\ndepression. Almost all MEN1 patients show parathyroidsymptoms by age 40.Tumors of the pancreas known as gastrinomas are\nalso common in MEN1. Excessive secretion of gastrin (ahormone secreted into the stomach to aid in digestion) bythese tumors can cause upper gastrointestinal ulcers. Theanterior pituitary and the adrenal glands can also beaffected. Unlike MEN2, the thyroid gland is rarelyinvolved in MEN1 symptoms.\nPatients with MEN2A and MEN2B experience two\nmain symptoms, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and a\ntumor of the adrenal gland medulla known as pheochro-\nmocytoma . MTC is a slow-growing cancer , but one that\ncan be cured in less than 50% of cases. Pheochromocy-toma is usually a benign tumor that causes excessivesecretion of adrenal hormones, which, in turn, can causelife-threatening hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia.\nThe two forms of MEN2 are distinguished by addi-\ntional symptoms. MEN2A patients have a predispositionto increase in size (hypertrophy) and to develop tumorsof the parathyroid gland. Although similar to MEN1, lessthan 20% of MEN2A patients will show parathyroidinvolvement.\nMEN2B patients show a variety of additional condi-\ntions: a characteristic facial appearance with swollenlips; tumors of the mucous membranes of the eye, mouth,tongue, and nasal cavity; enlarged colon; and skeletalabnormalities. Symptoms develop early in life (oftenunder five years of age) in cases of MEN2B and thetumors are more aggressive. MEN2B is about 10-foldless common than MEN2A.\nMEN1 is caused by mutation at the PYGM gene.\nPYGM is one of a group of genes known as tumor sup-pressor genes. A patient who inherits one defective copyof a tumor suppressor gene from either parent has astrong predisposition to the disease because of the highprobability of incurring a second mutation in at least onedividing cell. That cell no longer possesses even one nor-mal copy of the gene. When both copies are defective,tumor suppression fails and tumors develop.\nBoth types of MEN2 are caused by mutations in\nanother gene, known as RET. A mutation in only onecopy of the RET gene is sufficient to cause disease. Anumber of different mutations can lead to MEN2A, butonly one specific genetic alteration leads to MEN2B.\nFor all types of MEN, the children of an affected indi-\nvidual have a 50% chance of inheriting the defective gene.\nDiagnosis\nClassical diagnosis of MEN is based on clinical fea-\ntures and on testing for elevated hormone levels. ForMEN1, the relevant hormone is parathyroid hormone.For both types of MEN2, the greatest concern is devel-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2236Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromesopment of medullary thyroid cancer. MTC can be\ndetected by measuring levels of the thyroid hormone,calcitonin. Numerous other hormone levels can be mea-sured to assess the involvement of the various otherendocrine glands.\nDiagnosis of MEN2B can be made by physical\nexamination alone. However, MEN2A shows no distinct\nphysical features and must be identified by measuringhormone levels or by finding endocrine tumors.\nSince 1994, genetic screening using DNA technolo-\ngy has been available for both MEN1 and MEN2. Thisnew methodology allows diagnosis prior to the onset ofsymptoms.\nIn the past, there was no way of definitively identify-\ning which children had inherited the defective gene. As aresult, all children had to be considered at risk. In thecase of MEN2A and MEN2B, children would undergofrequent calcitonin testing. Molecular techniques nowallow a positive distinction to be made between childrenwho are and are not actually at risk.\nChildren who are identified as carriers of the RET\ngene can be offered total thyroidectomy on a preventative\n(prophylactic) basis to prevent the development of MTC.\nTreatment\nNo comprehensive treatment is available for genetic\nconditions such as MEN. However, some of the conse-quences of MEN can be symptomatically treated.\nPheochromocytoma in both types of MEN 2 can be\ncured by surgical removal of this slow growing tumor.\nTreatment of MTC is by surgical removal of the thy-\nroid, although doctors may disagree at what stage toremove the thyroid. After thyroidectomy, the patient willreceive normal levels of thyroid hormone orally or byinjection.\nEven when surgery is performed early, metastatic\nspread of the cancer may have already occurred. Sincethis cancer is slow growing, metastasis may not be obvi-ous. Metastasis is very serious in MTC because chemo-\ntherapy and radiation therapy are not effective in con-\ntrolling its spread.\nPrognosis\nDiagnosed early, the prognosis for the MEN dis-\neases is reasonably good, even for MEN2B, the mostdangerous of the three forms. Even in the absence oftreatment, a few individuals with MEN2A mutations willnever show any symptoms at all. Analysis of at-risk fami-ly members using molecular genetic techniques will leadto earlier treatment and improved outcomes.Prevention\nOne of the most serious consequences of MEN is\nMTC, which can be prevented by thyroidectomy. Thereis no preventive measure to block the occurrence ofgenetic mutations such as those that cause MEN.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nGardner, David G. “Recent Advances in Multiple Endocrine\nNeoplasia Syndromes.” Advances in Internal Medicine\n(1997): 597-625.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2237Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes\nB.

    "title": "Multiple myeloma",
    "content": "Multiple myeloma\nDefinition\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer in which antibody-\nproducing plasma cells grow in an uncontrolled and inva-sive (malignant) manner.\nDescription\nMultiple myeloma, also known as plasma cell myelo-\nma, is the second-most common cancer of the blood. It isthe most common type of plasma cell neoplasm. Multiplemyeloma accounts for approximately 1% of all cancersand 2% of all deaths from cancer. Multiple myeloma is adisease in which malignant plasma cells spread throughthe bone marrow and hard outer portions of the largebones of the body. These myeloma cells may form tumorscalled plasmacytomas. Eventually, multiple soft spots orholes, called osteolytic lesions, form in the bones.\nBone marrow is the spongy tissue within the bones.\nThe breastbone, spine, ribs, skull, pelvic bones, and thelong bone of the thigh all are particularly rich in marrow.Bone marrow is a very active tissue that is responsiblefor producing the cells that circulate in the blood. TheseKEY TERMS\nEndocrine —A term used to describe the glands\nthat produce hormones in the body.\nHyperplasia —An overgrowth of normal cells\nwithin an organ or tissue.\nMedullary thyroid cancer (MTC) —A slow-grow-\ning tumor associated with MEN.\nNeoplasm —An abnormal formation of tissue; for\nexample, a tumor.\nPheochromocytoma —A tumor of the medullary of\nthe adrenal gland.include the red blood cells that carry oxygen, the white\nblood cells that develop into immune system cells, andplatelets, which cause blood to clot.\nPlasma cells and immunoglobulins\nPlasma cells develop from B-lymphocytes or B-\ncells, a type of white blood cell. B-cells, like all bloodcells, develop from unspecialized stem cells in the bonemarrow. Each B-cell carries a specific antibody that rec-ognizes a specific foreign substance called an antigen.Antibodies are large proteins called immunoglobulins(Igs), which recognize and destroy foreign substancesand organisms such as bacteria. When a B-cell encoun-ters its antigen, it begins to divide rapidly to form matureplasma cells. These plasma cells are all identical (mono-clonal). They produce large amounts of identical anti-body that are specific for the antigen.\nMalignant plasma cells\nMultiple myeloma begins when the genetic material\n(DNA) is damaged during the development of a stem cellinto a B-cell in the bone marrow. This causes the cell todevelop into an abnormal or malignant plasmablast, adevelopmentally early form of plasma cell. Plasmablastsproduce adhesive molecules that allow them to bond tothe inside of the bone marrow. A growth factor, calledinterleukin-6, promotes uncontrolled growth of thesemyeloma cells in the bone marrow and prevents their nat-ural death . Whereas normal bone marrow contains less\nthan 5% plasma cells, bone marrow of an individual withmultiple myeloma contains over 10% plasma cells.\nIn most cases of multiple myeloma, the malignant\nplasma cells all make an identical Ig. Igs are made up offour protein chains that are bonded together. Two of thechains are light and two are heavy. There are five classes ofheavy chains, corresponding to five types of Igs with differ-ent immune system functions. The Igs from myeloma cellsare nonfunctional and are called paraproteins. All of theparaproteins from any one individual are monoclonal(identical) because the myeloma cells are identical clonesof a single plasma cell. Thus, the paraprotein is a mono-clonal protein or M-protein. The M-proteins crowd out thefunctional Igs and other components of the immune sys-tem. They also cause functional antibodies, which are pro-duced by normal plasma cells, to rapidly break down.Thus, multiple myeloma depresses the immune system.\nIn about 75% of multiple myeloma cases, the malig-\nnant plasma cells also produce monoclonal light chains,or incomplete Igs. These are called Bence-Jones proteinsand are secreted in the urine. Approximately 1% of mul-tiple myelomas are called nonsecretors because they donot produce any abnormal Ig.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2238Multiple myelomaOsteolytic lesions\nAbout 70% of individuals with multiple myeloma\nhave soft spots or lesions in their bones. These lesionscan vary from quite small to grapefruit-size. In part,these lesions occur because the malignant plasma cellsrapidly outgrow the normal bone-forming cells. In addi-tion, malignant myeloma cells produce factors that affectcells called osteoclasts. These are the cells that normallydestroy old bone, so that new bone can be produced bycells called osteoblasts. The myeloma cell factorsincrease both the activation and the growth of osteo-clasts. As the osteoclasts multiply and migrate, theydestroy healthy bone and create lesions. Osteoporosis ,\nor widespread bone weakness, may develop.\nThere are more than 40,000 multiple myeloma\npatients in the United States. The American Cancer Soci-ety predicts an additional 14,400 new cases in 2001.About 11,200 Americans will die of the disease in 2001.Multiple myeloma is one of the leading causes of cancerdeaths among African-Americans.\nIn Western industrialized countries, approximately\nfour people in 100,000 develop multiple myeloma. Theincidence of multiple myeloma among African- Ameri-cans is 9.5 per 100,000, about twice that of Caucasians.Asians have a much lower incidence of the disease. InChina, for example, the incidence of multiple myelomais only one in 100,000. The offspring and siblings ofindividuals with multiple myeloma are at a slightlyincreased risk for the disease.\nAt diagnosis, the average age of a multiple myeloma\npatient is 68 to 70. Although the average age at onset isdecreasing, most multiple myelomas still occur in peopleover 40. This cancer is somewhat more prevalent in menthan in women.\nCauses and symptoms\nAssociations\nThe cause of multiple myeloma has not been deter-\nmined. However, a number of possible associations havebeen identified:\n• decreased immune system function; the immune sys-\ntems of older individuals may be less efficient at detect-ing and destroying cancer cells\n• genetic (hereditary) factors, suggested by the increased\nincidence in some ethnic groups and among familymembers\n• occupational factors, suggested by the increased inci-\ndence among agricultural, petroleum, wood, and leatherworkers, and cosmetologists• long-term exposure to herbicides, pesticides, petroleum\nproducts, heavy metals, plastics, and dusts such asasbestos\n• radiation exposure, as among Japanese atomic bomb\nsurvivors, nuclear weapons workers, and medical per-sonnel such as radiologists\n• Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (also called\nhuman herpes virus-8 or HHV-8), found in the blood andbone marrow cells of many multiple myeloma patients\nEarly symptoms\nThe accumulation of malignant plasma cells can\nresult in tiny cracks or fractures in bones. Malignant\nplasma cells in the bone marrow can suppress the forma-tion of red and white blood cells and platelets. About80% of individuals with multiple myeloma are anemicdue to low red blood cell formation. Low white bloodcell formation results in increased susceptibility to infec-tion, since new, functional antibodies are not produced.In addition, normal circulating antibodies are rapidlydestroyed. Low platelet formation can result in poorblood clotting. It is rare, however, that insufficient whiteblood cell and platelet formations are presenting signs ofmultiple myeloma.\nThese factors cause the early symptoms of multiple\nmyeloma:\n•pain in the lower back or ribs\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2239Multiple myeloma\nThis x ray of the patient’s left clavicle indicates an occur-\nrence of myelomas in the bone. (Custom Medical Stock Photo.\nReproduced by permission.)• fatigue and paleness due to anemia (low red blood cell\ncount)\n• frequent and recurring infections, including bacterial\npneumonia , urinary-tract and kidney infections, and\nshingles\n• bleeding\nBone destruction\nBone pain, particularly in the backbone, hips, and\nskull, is often the first symptom of multiple myeloma. Asmalignant plasma cells increase in the bone marrow,replacing normal marrow, they exert pressure on the bone.As overly-active osteoclasts (large cells responsible for thebreakdown of bone) remove bone tissue, the bone becomessoft. Fracture and spinal cord compression may occur.\nPlasmacytomas (malignant tumors of plasma cells)\nmay weaken bones, causing fractures. Fractured bones orweak or collapsed spinal bones, in turn, may place unusu-al pressure on nearby nerves, resulting in nerve pain,burning, or numbness and muscle weakness. Proteins pro-duced by myeloma cells also may damage nerves.\nCalcium from the destroyed bone enters the blood\nand urine, causing hypercalcemia , a medical condition\nin which abnormally high concentrations of calciumcompounds exist in the bloodstream. High calciumaffects nerve cell and kidney function. The symptoms ofhypercalcemia include:\n• weakness and fatigue\n• depression• mental confusion• constipation\n• increased thirst\n• icreased urination• nausea and vomiting• kidney pain• kidney failure\nHypercalcemia affects about one-third of multiple\nmyeloma patients.\nSerum proteins\nThe accumulation of M-proteins in the serum (the\nliquid portion of the blood) may cause additional compli-cations, such as hyperviscosity syndrome, or thickeningof the blood (though rare in multiple myeloma patients).Symptoms of hyperviscosity include:\n• fatigue\n• headaches\n• shortness of breath• mental confusion\n• chest pain\n• kidney damage and failure\n• vision problems• Raynaud’s phenomenon\nPoor blood circulation, or Raynaud’s phenomenon,\ncan affect any part of the body, but particularly the fin-gers, toes, nose, and ears.\nCryoglobulinemia occurs when the protein in the\nblood forms particles under cold conditions. These parti-cles can block small blood vessels and cause pain andnumbness in the toes, fingers, and other extremities dur-ing cold weather.\nAmyloidosis is a rare complication of multiple\nmyeloma. It usually occurs in individuals whose plasmacells produce only Ig light chains. These Bence-Jonesproteins combine with other serum proteins to form amy-loid protein. This starchy substance can invade tissues,organs, and blood vessels. In particular, amyloid proteinscan accumulate in the kidneys, where they block the tinytubules that are the kidney’s filtering system. Indicatorsof amyloidosis include:\n• carpal tunnel syndrome• kidney failure\n• liver failure\n• heart failure\nDiagnosis\nBlood and urine tests\nOften, the original diagnosis of multiple myeloma is\nmade from routine blood tests that are performed forother reasons. Blood tests may indicate:\n• anemia\n• abnormal red blood cells\n• high serum protein levels• how levels of normal antibody\n• high calcium levels\n• high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels• high creatinine levels\nUrea and creatinine normally are excreted in the\nurine. High levels of urea and creatinine in the bloodindicate that the kidneys are not functioning properly toeliminate these substances.\nProtein electrophoresis is a laboratory technique\nthat uses an electrical current to separate the differentproteins in the blood and urine on the basis of size and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2240Multiple myelomacharge. Since all of the multiple myeloma M-proteins in\nthe blood and urine are identical, electrophoresis ofblood and urine from a patient with multiple myelomashows a large M-protein spike, corresponding to the highconcentration of monoclonal Ig. Electrophoresis of theurine also can detect Bence-Jones proteins.\nBones\nA bone marrow aspiration utilizes a very thin, long\nneedle to remove a sample of marrow from the hip bone.KEY TERMS\nAmyloidosis —A complication of multiple myeloma\nin which amyloid protein accumulates in the kid-neys and other organs, tissues, and blood vessels.\nAnemia —Any condition in which the red blood cell\ncount is below normal.\nAntibody —Immunoglobulin produced by immune\nsystem cells that recognizes and binds to a specificforeign substance (antigen).\nAntigen —Foreign substance that is recognized by a\nspecific antibody.\nB-cell (B-lymphocyte) —Type of white blood cell\nthat produces antibodies.\nBence-Jones protein —Light chain of an immuno-\nglobulin that is overproduced in multiple myelomaand is excreted in the urine.\nBeta 2-microglobulin —Protein produced by B-\ncells; high concentrations in the blood are indica-tive of multiple myeloma.\nCryoglobulinemia —Condition in which protein in\nthe blood forms particles in the cold, blockingblood vessels, leading to pain and numbness of theextremities.\nElectrophoresis —Use of an electrical field to sepa-\nrate proteins in a mixture (such as blood or urine),on the basis of the size and electrical charge of theproteins.\nHemoglobin —Protein in red blood cells that carries\noxygen.\nHypercalcemia —Abnormally high levels of calci-\num in the blood.\nHyperviscosity —Thick, viscous blood, caused by\nthe accumulation of large proteins, such asimmunoglobulins, in the serum.Immunoglobulin (Ig) —Antibody; large protein pro-\nduced by B-cells that recognizes and binds to a spe-cific antigen.\nM-protein —Monoclonal or myeloma protein; para-\nprotein; abnormal antibody found in large amountsin the blood and urine of individuals with multiplemyeloma.\nMalignant —A characteristic of cancer cells that\ngrow uncontrollably and invade other tissues.\nMonoclonal —Identical cells or proteins; cells\n(clones) derived from a single, genetically-distinctcell, or proteins produced by these cells.\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined signifi-\ncance (MGUS) —Common condition in which M-\nprotein is present, but there are no tumors or othersymptoms of disease.\nNeoplasm —Tumor or abnormal tissue, made up of\nrapidly growing cells.\nOsteoblast —Bone-forming cell.\nOsteoclast —Cell that absorbs bone.\nOsteolytic lesion —Soft spot or hole in bone caused\nby cancer cells.\nOsteoporosis —Condition in which the bones\nbecome weak and porous, due to loss of calciumand destruction of cells.\nParaprotein —M-protein; abnormal immunoglobu-\nlin produced in multiple myeloma.\nPlasma cell —Type of white blood cell that pro-\nduces antibodies; derived from an antigen-specificB-cell.\nPlatelet —Cell that is involved in blood clotting.\nStem cell —Undifferentiated cell that retains the\nability to develop into any one of numerous celltypes.\nAlternatively, a bone marrow biopsy with a larger needle\nremoves solid marrow tissue. The marrow is examinedunder the microscope for plasma cells and tumors. If10% to 30% of the cells are plasma cells, multiplemyeloma is the usual diagnosis.\nX rays are used to detect osteoporosis, osteolytic\nlesions, and fractures. Computer-assisted tomography (CATor CT) scans can detect lesions in both bone and soft tissue.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may give a more\ndetailed image of a certain bone or a region of the body.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2241Multiple myelomaTreatment\nRelated disorders\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined signifi-\ncance (MGUS) is a common condition in which a mono-clonal Ig is detectable. However, there are no tumors orother symptoms of multiple myeloma. MGUS occurs inabout 1% of the general population and in about 3% ofthose over age 70. Over a period of years, about 16% to20% of those with MGUS will develop multiple myelo-ma or a related cancer called malignant lymphoma.\nOccasionally, only a single plasmacytoma develops,\neither in the bone marrow (isolated plasmacytoma of thebone) or other tissues or organs (extramedullary plasma-cytoma). Some individuals with solitary plasmacytomamay develop multiple myeloma.\nClinical stages\nThe Durie-Salmon system is used to stage multiple\nmyeloma. Stage I multiple myeloma requires all of thefollowing (1 gram = approx. 0.02 pints, 1 deciliter =approx. 0.33 ounces):\n• hemoglobin (the oxygen-transporting molecule of red\nblood cells) above 10 grams/deciliter (g/dl)\n• serum calcium below 12 mg/dl\n• normal bone structure or only isolated plasmacytoma\n• low M-protein, based on established guideline levels of\nIg protein chains\nApproximately 5% of multiple myeloma cases are not\nprogressing at diagnosis, and may not progress for monthsor years. This is called smoldering myeloma. Thesepatients have stage I blood chemistry but no symptoms.\nStage II multiple myeloma fits neither stage I nor\nstage III. Stage III multiple myeloma meets one or moreof the following criteria:\n• hemoglobin below 8.5 g/dl• serum calcium above 12 mg/dl\n• advanced bone lesions\n• high M-protein\nEach stage is subclassified as A or B, based on\nserum creatinine indicators of normal or abnormal kid-ney function. Most patients have stage III multiplemyeloma at diagnosis.\nPrognostic indicators\nPrognostic indicators for multiple myeloma may be\nused instead of, or in addition to, the staging systemdescribed above. Prognostic indicators are laboratorytests that help to define the stage of the disease at diagno-sis, and its progression during treatment. These indica-\ntors are:\n• plasmablastic multiple myeloma (presence of plas-\nmablasts, the precursor malignant plasma cells)\n• plasma cell labeling index (the percentage of plasma\ncells that are actively dividing)\n• beta 2-microglobulin, a protein secreted by B-cells that\ncorrelates with the myeloma cell mass (also indicateskidney damage)\nSince multiple myeloma often progresses slowly, and\nsince the treatments can be toxic, the disease may not betreated until M-protein levels in the blood are quite high.In particular, MGUS and smoldering myeloma may befollowed closely but not treated. Solitary plasmacytomasare treated with radiation and/or surgery and followedclosely with examinations and laboratory tests.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy , or treatment with anti-cancer\ndrugs, is used for multiple myeloma. MP, a combinationof the drugs melphalan and prednisone, is the standardtreatment. Usually, the drugs are taken by mouth every 3to 4 weeks for 6 to 9 months or longer, until the M-pro-tein levels in the blood stop decreasing. MP usuallyresults in a 50% reduction in M-protein.\nDexamethasone, a corticosteroid, sometimes is used\nto treat the elderly or those in poor health. It can drop theM-protein levels by 40% in untreated individuals and by20% to 40% in patients who have not responded to previ-ous treatment. Other chemotherapy drugs, includingcyclophosphamide, carmustine, doxorubicin, vincristine,and chlorambucil, may be used as well.\nMultiple myeloma usually recurs within a year after\nthe end of chemotherapy. Although the chemotherapycan be repeated after each recurrence, it is progressivelyless responsive to treatment.\nSide effects of chemotherapy may include:\n• anemia\n• hair loss\n• nausea\n• vomiting• diarrhea\n• mood swings\n• swelling\n• acne\nThese side effects disappear after treatment is dis-\ncontinued.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2242Multiple myelomaOther drug treatments\nBisphosphonates are drugs that inhibit the activity of\nosteoclasts. These drugs can slow the progression of bonedisease, reduce pain, and help prevent bone fractures. Dif-ferent types of bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts in dif-ferent ways. They also reduce the production of inter-leukin-6 by bone marrow cells. Laboratory studies sug-gest that bisphosphonates may kill or inhibit the growthof multiple myeloma cells. Pamidronate is the most com-mon bisphosphonate for treating multiple myeloma.\nThe drug thalidomide appears to have several anti-\nmyeloma activities. Thalidomide affects the immune sys-tem in various ways and it appears to inhibit myelomacells, both directly and indirectly. It also inhibits thegrowth of new blood vessels that are needed by tumors.However, if thalidomide is taken during pregnancy ,i t\ncan cause severe birth defects or death of the fetus.\nThe drug allopurinol may be used to reduce high\nblood levels of uric acid that result from kidney dysfunc-tion. Diuretics can improve kidney function. Infections\nrequire prompt treatment with antibiotics .\nBONE AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANS-\nPLANTATION. Bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell\ntransplantations (PBSCT) are used to replace the stem cellsof the bone marrow following high-dosage chemotherapy.Chemotherapy destroys the bone marrow stem cells that arenecessary to produce new blood cells. In an autologoustransplant, the patient’s bone marrow stem cells or peripher-al blood stem cells (immature bone marrow cells found inthe blood) are collected, treated with drugs to kill anymyeloma cells, and frozen prior to chemotherapy. Growthfactors are used to increase the number of peripheral stemcells prior to collection. A procedure called apheresis isused to collect the peripheral stem cells. Following high-dosage chemotherapy, the stem cells are reinjected into theindividual. In an allogeneic transplant, the donor stem cellscome from a genetically-related individual such as a sibling.\nOther treatments\nBlood transfusions may be required to treat severe\nanemia.\nPlasmapheresis , or plasma exchange transfusion ,\nmay be used to thin the blood to treat hyperviscosity syn-drome. In this treatment, blood is removed and passedthrough a machine that separates the plasma, containingthe M-protein, from the red and white blood cells andplatelets. The blood cells are transfused back into thepatient, along with a plasma substitute or donated plasma.\nMultiple myeloma may be treated with high-energy\nx rays directed at a specific region of the body. Radia-\ntion therapy is used for treating bone pain.Alternative treatment\nInterferon alpha, an immune-defense protein that is\nproduced by some white blood cells and bone marrowcells, can slow the growth of myeloma cells. It usually isgiven to patients following chemotherapy, to prolongtheir remission. However, interferon may have toxiceffects in older individuals with multiple myeloma.\nOnce multiple myeloma is in remission, calcium and\nvitamin D supplements can improve bone density. It isimportant not to take these supplements when the myelo-ma is active. Individuals with multiple myeloma mustdrink large amounts of fluid to counter the effects ofhyperviscous blood.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for individuals with MGUS or soli-\ntary plasmacytoma is very good. Most do not developmultiple myeloma. However, approximately 15% of allpatients with multiple myeloma die within three monthsof diagnosis. About 60% respond to treatment and livefor an average of two and a half to three years followingdiagnosis. Approximately 23% of patients die of otherillnesses associated with advanced age.\nThe prognosis for a given individual may be based on\nthe prognostic indicators described above. The mediansurvival for those without plasmablasts, and with a lowplasma cell labeling index (PCLI) and low beta 2-microglobulin, is 5.5 years. The median survival forpatients with plasmablastic multiple myeloma, or with ahigh PCLI (1% or greater) and high beta 2-microglobulin(4 or higher), is 1.9 and 2.4 years, respectively. Manymultiple myeloma patients are missing part or all of chro-mosome 13. The deletion of this chromosome, along withhigh beta 2-microglobulin, leads to a poor prognosis.\nWith treatment, multiple myeloma may go into com-\nplete remission. This is defined as:\n• M-protein absent from the blood and urine\n• myeloma cells not detectable in the bone marrow\n• no clinical symptoms• negative laboratory tests\nHowever, with very sensitive testing, a few myeloma\ncells are usually detectable and eventually lead to a recur-rence of the disease, in the bone or elsewhere in the body.\nPrevention\nThere are no clearly-established risk factors for mul-\ntiple myeloma and it is possible that a combination offactors interact to cause the disease. Thus, there is nomethod for preventing multiple myeloma.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2243Multiple myelomaResources\nBOOKS\nDrum, David. Making the Chemotherapy Decision, 2nd ed.

    "title": "Multiple personality disorder",
    "content": "Multiple personality disorder\nDefinition\nMultiple personality disorder, or MPD, is a mental\ndisturbance classified as one of the dissociative disor-ders in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statisti-\ncal Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV ). It has been\nrenamed dissociative identity disorder (DID). MPD orDID is defined as a condition in which “two or more dis-tinct identities or personality states” alternate in control-ling the patient’s consciousness and behavior. Note:“Split personality” is not an accurate term for DID andshould not be used as a synonym for schizophrenia .\nDescription\nThe precise nature of DID (MPD) as well as its rela-\ntionship to other mental disorders is still a subject ofdebate. Some researchers think that DID may be a relative-ly recent development in western society. It may be a cul-ture-specific syndrome found in western society, causedprimarily by both childhood abuse and unspecified long-\nterm societal changes. Unlike depression or anxiety disor-\nders, which have been recognized, in some form, for cen-\nturies, the earliest cases of persons reporting DID symp-toms were not recorded until the 1790s. Most were consid-ered medical oddities or curiosities until the late 1970s,when increasing numbers of cases were reported in theUnited States. Psychiatrists are still debating whether DIDwas previously misdiagnosed and underreported, orwhether it is currently over-diagnosed. Because childhoodtrauma is a factor in the development of DID, some doctorsthink it may be a variation of post-traumatic stress disor-\nder(PTSD). DID and PTSD are conditions where dissoci-\nation is a prominent mechanism. The female to male ratiofor DID is about 9:1, but the reasons for the gender imbal-ance are unclear. Some have attributed the imbalance inreported cases to higher rates of abuse of female children;and some to the possibility that males with DID are under-reported because they might be in prison for violent crimes.\nThe most distinctive feature of DID is the formation\nand emergence of alternate personality states, or “alters.”Patients with DID experience their alters as distinctiveindividuals possessing different names, histories, andpersonality traits. It is not unusual for DID patients tohave alters of different genders, sexual orientations, ages,or nationalities. Some patients have been reported withalters that are not even human; alters have been animals,or even aliens from outer space. The average DID patienthas between two and 10 alters, but some have beenreported with over one hundred.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe severe dissociation that characterizes patients with\nDID is currently understood to result from a set of causes:\n• an innate ability to dissociate easily• repeated episodes of severe physical or sexual abuse in\nchildhood\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2244Multiple personality disorder• the lack of a supportive or comforting person to coun-\nteract abusive relative(s)\n• the influence of other relatives with dissociative symp-\ntoms or disorders\nThe relationship of dissociative disorders to child-\nhood abuse has led to intense controversy and lawsuitsconcerning the accuracy of childhood memories. Thebrain’s storage, retrieval, and interpretation of childhoodmemories are still not fully understood.\nThe major dissociative symptoms experienced by\nDID patients are amnesia , depersonalization, derealiza-\ntion, and identity disturbances.\nAmnesia\nAmnesia in DID is marked by gaps in the patient’s\nmemory for long periods of their past, in some cases,their entire childhood. Most DID patients have amnesia,or “lose time,” for periods when another personality is“out.” They may report finding items in their house thatthey can’t remember having purchased, finding noteswritten in different handwriting, or other evidence ofunexplained activity.\nDepersonalization\nDepersonalization is a dissociative symptom in\nwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unreal, ischanging, or is dissolving. Some DID patients experi-KEY TERMS\nAlter —An alternate or secondary personality in a\npatient with DID.\nAmnesia —A general medical term for loss of mem-\nory that is not due to ordinary forgetfulness. Amne-sia can be caused by head injuries, brain disease, orepilepsy as well as by dissociation.\nDepersonalization —A dissociative symptom in\nwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unre-al, is changing, or is dissolving.\nDerealization —A dissociative symptom in which\nthe external environment is perceived as unreal.\nDissociation —A psychological mechanism that\nallows the mind to split off traumatic memories ordisturbing ideas from conscious awareness.\nDissociative identity disorder (DID) —Term that\nreplaced Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). Acondition in which two or more distinctive identi-\nties or personality states alternate in controlling aperson’s consciousness and behavior.\nHypnosis —An induced trance state used to treat the\namnesia and identity disturbances that occur in dis-sociative identity disorder (DID).\nMultiple personality disorder (MPD) —The former,\nthough often still used, term for dissociative identitydisorder (DID).\nPrimary personality —The core personality of a DID\npatient. In women, the primary personality is oftentimid and passive, and may be diagnosed asdepressed.\nTrauma —A disastrous or life- threatening event that\ncan cause severe emotional distress. DID is associ-ated with trauma in a person’s early life or adultexperience.\nence depersonalization as feeling to be outside of their\nbody, or as watching a movie of themselves.\nDerealization\nDerealization is a dissociative symptom in which the\npatient perceives the external environment as unreal.Patients may see walls, buildings, or other objects aschanging in shape, size, or color. DID patients may failto recognize relatives or close friends.\nIdentity disturbances\nIdentity disturbances in DID result from the\npatient’s having split off entire personality traits or char-acteristics as well as memories. When a stressful or trau-matic experience triggers the reemergence of these disso-ciated parts, the patient switches — usually within sec-onds — into an alternate personality. Some patients havehistories of erratic performance in school or in their jobscaused by the emergence of alternate personalities duringexaminations or other stressful situations. Patients varywith regard to their alters’ awareness of one another.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of DID is complex and some physi-\ncians believe it is often missed, while others feel it isover-diagnosed. Patients have been known to have beentreated under a variety of other psychiatric diagnoses fora long time before being re-diagnosed with DID. The\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2245Multiple personality disorderaverage DID patient is in the mental health care system\nfor six to seven years before being diagnosed as a personwith DID. Many DID patients are misdiagnosed asdepressed because the primary or “core” personality issubdued and withdrawn, particularly in female patients.However, some core personalities, or alters, may gen-uinely be depressed, and may benefit from antidepressantmedications. One reason misdiagnoses are common isbecause DID patients may truly meet the criteria forpanic disorder or somatization disorder.\nMisdiagnoses include schizophrenia, borderline per-\nsonality disorder, and, as noted, somatization disorder andpanic disorder. DID patients are often frightened by theirdissociative experiences, which can include losing aware-ness of hours or even days of time, meeting people whoclaim to know them by another name, or feeling “out ofbody.” Persons with the disorder may go to emergencyrooms or clinics because they fear they are going insane.\nWhen a doctor is evaluating a patient for DID, he or\nshe will first rule out physical conditions that sometimesproduce amnesia, depersonalization, or derealization.These conditions include head injuries; brain disease,especially seizure disorders; side effects from medica-tions; substance abuse or intoxication; AIDS dementia\ncomplex; or recent periods of extreme physical stress\nand sleeplessness. In some cases, the doctor may give thepatient an electroencephalograph (EEG) to excludeepilepsy or other seizure disorders. The physician alsomust consider whether the patient is malingering and/or\noffering fictitious complaints.\nIf the patient appears to be physically normal, the doc-\ntor will next rule out psychotic disturbances, includingschizophrenia. Many patients with DID are misdiagnosed asschizophrenic because they may “hear” their alters “talk-ing” inside their heads. If the doctor suspects DID, he or shecan use a screening test called the Dissociative ExperiencesScale (DES). If the patient has a high score on this test, he orshe can be evaluated further with the Dissociative DisordersInterview Schedule (DDIS) or the Structured Clinical Inter-view for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). The\ndoctor may also use the Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP) ora similar test of the patient’s hypnotizability.\nTreatment\nTreatment of DID may last for five to seven years in\nadults and usually requires several different treatmentmethods.\nPsychotherapy\nIdeally, patients with DID should be treated by a\ntherapist with specialized training in dissociation. Thisspecialized training is important because the patient’spersonality switches can be confusing or startling. In\naddition, many patients with DID have hostile or suicidalalter personalities. Most therapists who treat DIDpatients have rules or contracts for treatment that includesuch issues as the patient’s responsibility for his or hersafety. Psychotherapy for DID patients typically has sev-eral stages: an initial phase for uncovering and “map-ping” the patient’s alters; a phase of treating the traumat-ic memories and “fusing” the alters; and a phase of con-solidating the patient’s newly integrated personality.\nMost therapists who treat multiples, or DID patients,\nrecommend further treatment after personality integration,on the grounds that the patient has not learned the socialskills that most people acquire in adolescence and earlyadult life. In addition, family therapy is often recom-\nmended to help the patient’s family understand DID andthe changes that occur during personality reintegration.\nMany DID patients are helped by group as well as\nindividual treatment, provided that the group is limited topeople with dissociative disorders. DID patients some-times have setbacks in mixed therapy groups becauseother patients are bothered or frightened by their person-ality switches.\nMedications\nSome doctors will prescribe tranquilizers or antide-\npressants for DID patients because their alter personali-ties may have anxiety or mood disorders . However,\nother therapists who treat DID patients prefer to keepmedications to a minimum because these patients caneasily become psychologically dependent on drugs. Inaddition, many DID patients have at least one alter whoabuses drugs or alcohol, substances which are dangerousin combination with most tranquilizers.\nHypnosis\nWhile not always necessary, hypnosis is a standard\nmethod of treatment for DID patients. Hypnosis mayhelp patients recover repressed ideas and memories. Fur-ther, hypnosis can also be used to control problematicbehaviors that many DID patients exhibit, such as self-\nmutilation , or eating disorders like bulimia nervosa . In\nthe later stages of treatment, the therapist may use hyp-nosis to “fuse” the alters as part of the patient’s personal-ity integration process.\nAlternative treatment\nAlternative treatments that help to relax the body are\noften recommended for DID patients as an adjunct to psy-chotherapy and/or medication. These treatments includehydrotherapy , botanical medicine (primarily herbs that\nhelp the nervous system), therapeutic massage, and yoga .\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2246Multiple personality disorderHomeopathic treatment can also be effective for some\npeople. Art therapy and the keeping of journals are often\nrecommended as ways that patients can integrate theirpast into their present life. Meditation is usually discour-\naged until the patient’s personality has been reintegrated.\nPrognosis\nSome therapists believe that the prognosis for recov-\nery is excellent for children and good for most adults.Although treatment takes several years, it is often ulti-mately effective. As a general rule, the earlier the patient isdiagnosed and properly treated, the better the prognosis.\nPrevention\nPrevention of DID requires intervention in abusive\nfamilies and treating children with dissociative symp-toms as early as possible.\nResources\nBOOKS\n“Dissociative Disorders.” In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders. 4th ed.

There are two types of twinning—identical andfraternal. Identical twins represent the splitting of a singlefertilized zygote (union of two gametes or male/femalesex cells that produce a developing fetus) into two sepa-rate individuals. They usually, but not always, have identi-cal genes. When they do not separate completely, theresult is Siamese (or conjoined) twins. Fraternal twins arethree times as common as identical twins. They occurwhen two eggs are fertilized by separate sperm. Each hasa different selection of its parents’ genes. The natural inci-dence of multiple pregnancy has been upset by advancesin fertility treatments, resulting in higher rates of multiplebirths in the United States. All these children are fraternal;they each arose from a separate egg and a separate sperm.Cloning produces identical twins.\nThe human female is designed to release one egg\nevery menstrual cycle. A hormone called progesterone,released by the first egg to be produced, prevents anyother egg from maturing during that cycle. When thiscontrol fails, fertilization of more than one egg is possi-ble. Fertility drugs inhibit these controls, allowing multi-ple pregnancy to occur. Multiple pregnancy is more diffi-cult and poses more health risks than single pregnancy.Premature birth is greater with each additional fetus.\nThe problem with multiple births is that there is only\nso much room in even the most accommodating womb(uterus). Babies need to reach a certain size and gestation-al age before they can survive outside the uterus. Prema-\nturity is the constant threat of multiple pregnancies.\nTwins have five times the death rate of single births.\nTriplets and higher die even more often. The principlethreat of prematurity is that the lungs are not fully devel-oped. A disease called hyaline membrane disease afflictspremature infants. Their lungs do not stay open after theirfirst breath because they lack a chemical called surfactant.Survival of premature infants was greatly improved when\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2247Multiple pregnancysurfactant was finally synthesized in a form that could be\nof benefit to premature babies. Tiny babies also have trou-ble regulating their body temperature.\nCauses and symptoms\nFertility drugs prevent the normal process of single\novulation by permitting more than one egg at a time tomature and ovulate (move from the ovary to the uterus inanticipation of fertilization). This happens naturally to pro-duce fraternal twins. The first drug to accomplish this wasclomiphene. Subsequently, two natural hormones—folli-cle stimulating hormone and chorionic gonadotrophin—were developed and used.\nDiagnosis\nMultiple pregnancies cause the uterus to grow faster\nthan usual. Obstetricians can detect this unusually rapidgrowth as the pregnancy progresses. Before birth, anultrasound will also detect multiple babies in the uterus.\nAfter birth, physical appearance or a careful examinationof the placenta and amniotic membranes will usuallyreveal whether the babies were in the same water bag orseparate ones. One bag means identical twins.\nA multiple pregnancy almost always means increased\nmonitoring and surveillance for complications. This oftenmeans more frequent visits to the healthcare provider, seri-al ultrasounds to make sure that the babies are growingadequately, amniocentesis to check for lung development,\nand close monitoring for preterm labor.\nTreatment\nMothers may be put on bedrest during a multiple\npregnancy, in order to try to prevent pre-term labor anddelivery.

Multiple pregnancies more often end\nin cesarean deliveries than singleton pregnancies.\nBabies from multiple pregnancies are often born\nearly, and may require longer-than-normal hospitaliza-tion. The babies may need assistance with breathing,careful control of body temperature within an incubator,and surveillance for other complications that frequentlybeset pre-term babies. While premature babies are fragilein many other ways, modern methods of intensive carehave successfully stabilized babies as small as one pound.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are no specific treatments to alleviate medical\ndifficulties caused by multiple pregnancies, howeverthere are supportive measures that may help both motherand children recover from the birthing process. There aretreatments to encourage breast milk production and tocombat postpartum difficulties. Various homeopathicremedies and massage can be helpful to both mother andchildren during the early adjustment period after birth.\nPrognosis\nWith modern medical advances and excellent prena-\ntal care, many multiple pregnancies reach fruition with-out difficulties.

    "content": "Multiple sclerosis\nDefinition\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune\ndisorder affecting movement, sensation, and bodily func-tions. It is caused by destruction of the myelin insulationcovering nerve fibers (neurons) in the central nervoussystem (brain and spinal cord).\nDescription\nMS is a nerve disorder caused by destruction of the\ninsulating layer surrounding neurons in the brain andspinal cord. This insulation, called myelin, helps electri-cal signals pass quickly and smoothly between the brainand the rest of the body. When the myelin is destroyed,nerve messages are sent more slowly and less efficiently.Patches of scar tissue, called plaques, form over theaffected areas, further disrupting nerve communication.The symptoms of MS occur when the brain and spinalcord nerves no longer communicate properly with otherparts of the body. MS causes a wide variety of symptomsand can affect vision, balance, strength, sensation, coor-dination, and bodily functions.\nMultiple sclerosis affects more than a quarter of a\nmillion people in the United States. Most people havetheir first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40;symptoms rarely begin before 15 or after 60. Women arealmost twice as likely to get MS as men, especially intheir early years. People of northern European heritageare more likely to be affected than people of other racialbackgrounds, and MS rates are higher in the UnitedStates, Canada, and Northern Europe than in other partsof the world. MS is very rare among Asians, North andSouth American Indians, and Eskimos.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, meaning\nits cause is an attack by the body’s own immune system.For unknown reasons, immune cells attack and destroy themyelin sheath that insulates neurons in the brain andspinal cord. This myelin sheath, created by other braincells called glia, speeds transmission and prevents electri-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2249Multiple sclerosiscal activity in one cell from short-circuiting to another cell.\nDisruption of communication between the brain and otherparts of the body prevent normal passage of sensations andcontrol messages, leading to the symptoms of MS. Thedemyelinated areas appear as plaques, small round areasof gray neuron without the white myelin covering. Theprogression of symptoms in MS is correlated with devel-opment of new plaques in the portion of the brain or spinalcord controlling the affected areas. Because there appearsto be no pattern in the appearance of new plaques, the pro-gression of MS can be unpredictable.\nDespite considerable research, the trigger for this\nautoimmune destruction is still unknown. At varioustimes, evidence has pointed to genes, environmental fac-tors, viruses, or a combination of these.\nThe risk of developing MS is higher if another fami-\nly member is affected, suggesting the influence of genet-ic factors. In addition, the higher prevalence of MSamong people of northern European background sug-gests some genetic susceptibility.\nThe role of an environmental factor is suggested by\nstudies of the effect of migration on the risk of develop-ing MS. Age plays an important role in determining thischange in risk—young people in low-risk groups whomove into countries with higher MS rates display the riskrates of their new surroundings, while older migrantsretain the risk of their original home country. One inter-pretation of these studies is that an environmental factor,either protective or harmful, is acquired in early life; therisk of disease later in life reflects the effects of the earlyenvironment.\nThese same data can be used to support the involve-\nment of a slow-acting virus, one that is acquired early onbut begins its destructive effects much later. Slow virusesare known to cause other diseases, including AIDS . In\naddition, viruses have been implicated in other autoim-mune diseases. Many claims have been made for the roleof viruses, slow or otherwise, as the trigger for MS, butas of 2001 no strong candidate has emerged.\nHow a virus could trigger the autoimmune reaction is\nalso unclear. There are two main models of virally inducedautoimmunity. The first suggests the immune system isactually attacking a virus (one too well-hidden for detec-tion in the laboratory), and the myelin damage is an unin-tentional consequence of fighting the infection. The sec-ond model suggests the immune system mistakes myelinfor a viral protein, one it encountered during a prior infec-tion. Primed for the attack, it destroys myelin because itresembles the previously-recognized viral invader.\nEither of these models allows a role for genetic fac-\ntors, since certain genes can increase the likelihood ofautoimmunity. Environmental factors as well mightchange the sensitivity of the immune system or interact\nwith myelin to provide the trigger for the secondaryimmune response. Possible environmental triggers thathave been invoked in MS include viral infection, trauma,electrical injury, and chemical exposure, although con-trolled studies do not support a causative role.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of multiple sclerosis may occur in\none of three patterns:\n• The most common pattern is the “relapsing-remitting”\npattern, in which there are clearly defined symptomaticattacks lasting 24 hours or more, followed by completeor almost complete improvement. The period betweenattacks may be a year or more at the beginning of thedisease, but may shrink to several months later on. Thispattern is especially common in younger people whodevelop MS.\n• In the “primary progressive” pattern, the disease pro-\ngresses without remission or with occasional plateausor slight improvements. This pattern is more commonin older people.\n• In the “secondary progressive” pattern, the person with\nMS begins with relapses and remissions, followed bymore steady progression of symptoms.\nBetween 10–20% of people have a benign type of\nMS, meaning their symptoms progress very little overthe course of their lives.\nBecause plaques may form in any part of the central\nnervous system, the symptoms of MS vary widely fromperson-to-person and from stage-to-stage of the disease.Initial symptoms often include:\n• muscle weakness, causing difficulty walking\n• loss of coordination or balance\n• numbness, “pins and needles,” or other abnormal sensa-\ntions\n• visual disturbances, including blurred or double vision\nLater symptoms may include:\n•fatigue\n• muscle spasticity and stiffness\n• tremors\n• paralysis•pain\n• vertigo\n• speech or swallowing difficulty• loss of bowel and bladder control\n• incontinence, constipation\n• sexual dysfunction\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2250Multiple sclerosis• cognitive changes\nWeakness in one or both legs is common, and may\nbe the first symptom noticed by a person with MS. Mus-cle spasticity, or excessive tightness, is also common andmay be more disabling than weakness.\nDouble vision or eye tremor ( nystagmus ) may result\nfrom involvement of the nerve pathways controllingmovement of the eye muscles. Visual disturbances resultfrom involvement of the optic nerves (optic neutritis) andmay include development of blind spots in one or botheyes, changes in color vision, or blindness. Optic neuri-\ntisusually involves only one eye at a time and is often\nassociated with movement of the affected eye.\nMore than half of all people affected by MS have pain\nduring the course of their disease, and many experiencechronic pain, including pain from spasticity. Acute painoccurs in about 10% of cases. This pain may be a sharp,stabbing pain especially in the face, neck, or down theback. Facial numbness and weakness are also common.\nCognitive changes, including memory disturbances,\ndepression, and personality changes, are found in peopleaffected by MS, though it is not entirely clear whether\nthese changes are due primarily to the disease or to thepsychological reaction to it. Depression may be severeenough to require treatment in up to 25% of those withMS. A smaller number of people experience disease-related euphoria, or abnormally elevated mood, usuallyafter a long disease duration and in combination withother psychological changes.\nSymptoms of MS may be worsened by heat or\nincreased body temperature, including fever , intense phys-\nical activity, or exposure to sun, hot baths, or showers.\nDiagnosis\nThere is no single test that confirms the diagnosis of\nmultiple sclerosis, and there are a number of other dis-eases with similar symptoms. While one person’s diag-nosis may be immediately suggested by her symptomsand history, another’s may not be confirmed withoutmultiple tests and prolonged observation. The distribu-tion of symptoms is important: MS affects multiple areasof the body over time. The pattern of symptoms is also\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2251Multiple sclerosis\nNerve cellMyelin sheathAbsence of \nmyelin sheath\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which immune cells attack and destroy the myelin sheath which stimu-\nlates neurons in the brain and spinal cord. When the myelin is destroyed, nerve messages are sent more slowly and less effi-ciently. Scar tissue then forms over the affected areas, disrupting nerve communication. MS symptoms occur when the brainand spinal cord nerves cease to communicate properly with other parts of the body. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)critical, especially evidence of the relapsing- remitting\npattern, so a detailed medical history is one of the mostimportant parts of the diagnostic process. A thoroughsearch to exclude other causes of a patient’s symptoms isespecially important if the following features are present:1) family history of neurologic disease, 2) symptoms andfindings attributable to a single anatomic location, 3) per-sistent back pain, 4) age of onset over 60 or under 15years of age, or 5) progressively worsening disease.\nIn addition to the medical history and a standard\nneurological exam, several lab tests are used to help con-firm or rule out a diagnosis of MS:\n• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal plaques\non the brain and spinal cord. Gadolinium enhancementcan distinguish between old and new plaques, allowinga correlation of new plaques with new symptoms.Plaques may be seen in several other diseases as well,including encephalomyelitis, neurosarcoidosis, andcerebral lupus. Plaques on MRI may be difficult to dis-tinguish from small strokes, areas of decreased bloodflow, or changes seen with trauma or normal aging .\n• A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, is done to measure\nlevels of immune proteins, which are usually elevatedin the cerebrospinal fluid of a person with MS. This testmay not be necessary if other tests are diagnostic.\n• Evoked potential tests, electrical tests of conduction\nspeed in the nerves, can reveal reduced speeds consistentwith the damage caused by plaques. These tests may bedone with small electrical charges applied to the skin(somatosensory evoked potential), with light patternsflashed on the eyes (visual evoked potential), or withsounds presented to the ears (auditory evoked potential).\nThe clinician making the diagnosis, usually a neu-\nrologist, may classify the disease as “definite MS,”meaning the symptoms and test results all point towardMS as the cause. “Probable MS” and “possible MS”reflect less certainty and may require more time to passto observe the progression of the disease and the distribu-tion of symptoms.\nTreatment\nThe three major drugs previously approved for the\ntreatment of MS affect the course of the disease. None ofthese drugs is a cure, but they can slow disease progres-sion in many patients.\nKnown as the ABC drugs, Avonex and Betaseron are\nforms of the immune system protein beta interferon,while Copaxone is glatiramer acetate (formerly calledcopolymer-1). All three have been shown to reduce therate of relapses in the relapsing-remitting form of MS.Different measurements from tests of each have demon-strated other benefits as well: Avonex may slow the\nprogress of physical impairment, Betaseron may reducethe severity of symptoms, and Copaxone may decreasedisability. All three drugs are administered by injection.\nTwo major clinical studies were recently completed\nthat focused on the question of whether disease-modify-ing therapy known to slow the disease, can postpone thedevelopment of clinically definitive MS in high riskpatients. Data presented at the annual meeting of theAmerican Academy of Neurology in May, 2000, high-lighted the different effects of interferon therapy when itwas initiated at the earliest recognizable stages of MSversus later. Previous studies with interferon beta-1b(Betaseron) and interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif) clear-ly demonstrated benefits in patients with relapsing formsof MS. Moreover, previous treatment with high-dose cor-\nticosteroids also delays, but does not prevent the ultimate\ndevelopment of MS. The encouraging message from theCHAMPS study in the United states and the ETOMSstudy in Europe is that early intervention can reduce theprobability of developing clinically definitive MS.\nAlthough the ABC drugs stop relapses and may keep\npatients in relatively good health for the short-term, theirlong-term success has not been proven and they don’twork well for patients who have reached a steadily pro-gressive stage of MS. In the meantime, new approaches tousing current therapies are being researched especiallyusing combinations of different types of agents when oneagent alone is not effective. Clinical trials are now evalu-ating the safety and efficacy of combining cyclophos-phamide (Cytoxan) and methylprednisolone (Medrol) inpatients who do not respond to the ABC drus, and ofadding mitoxantrone (Novantrone), prednisone (Prelone),azathioprine (Imuran), or methotrexate (Rheumatrex) tobeta-interferon for further benefit.\nIn addition, Miloxzantrone HCI (novantrone), a drug\napproved for cancer treatment, has been approved for\ntreating patients with advanced or chronic multiple scel-ereosis.In clinical trials, mitoxantrone reduced the num-ber of relapse episodes and slowed down the disease.Reserved for progressive forms of MS, it is given intra-venously by a doctor to help maintain mobility andreduce the number of flare-ups. However, there are seri-ous side effects with the drug including heart problems,nausea, and hair thinning.\nAs reported in the Spring, 2001, V olume 19, No 2\nissue of InsideMS, the FDA recently approved the Copax-one Autoject and the Mixject vial adapters to help peopleusing Copaxone self administer the drug. The autojectkeeps the syringe steady and hides the needle. The samesyringe may be used for both mixing and injecting withthe Mixject vial adapters. A similar device is available for\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2252Multiple sclerosispatients using Betassseron. Some patients are using the\nneedlefree Biojector 2000 which uses a CO@ cartridge todeliver doses of medication through the skin. The FDAhas not approved its use and patients should discuss thiswith their physician for its use with either Copaxone orBetaseron. Avonex must be injected in the muscle.\nImmunosuppressant drugs have been used for\nmany years to treat acute exacerbations (relapses). Drugsused include corticosteroids such as prednisone andmethylprednisone; the hormone adrenocorticotropic hor-mone (ACTH); and azathioprine. Recent studies indicatethat several days of intravenous methylprednisone maybe more effective than other immunosuppressant treat-ments for acute symptoms. This treatment may requirehospitalization.\nMS causes a large variety of symptoms, and the\ntreatments for these are equally diverse. Most symptomscan be treated and complications avoided with good careand attention from medical professionals. Good healthand nutrition remain important preventive measures.\nVaccination against influenza can prevent respiratory\ncomplications, and contrary to earlier concerns, is notassociated with worsening of symptoms. Preventingcomplications such as pneumonia , bed sores, injuries\nfrom falls, or urinary infection requires attention to theprimary problems which may cause them. Shortened lifespans with MS are almost always due to complicationsrather than primary symptoms themselves.\nPhysical therapy helps the person with MS to\nstrengthen and retrain affected muscles; to maintainrange of motion to prevent muscle stiffening; to learn touse assistive devices such as canes and walkers; and tolearn safer and more energy-efficient ways of moving,sitting, and transferring. Exercise and stretching pro-\ngrams are usually designed by the physical therapist andtaught to the patient and caregivers for use at home.Exercise is an important part of maintaining function forthe person with MS. Swimming is often recommended,not only for its low-impact workout, but also because itallows strenuous activity without overheating.\nOccupational therapy helps the person with MS\nadapt to her environment and adapt the environment toher. The occupational therapist suggests alternate strate-gies and assistive devices for activities of daily living,such as dressing, feeding, and washing, and evaluates thehome and work environment for safety and efficiencyimprovements that may be made.\nTraining in bowel and bladder care may be needed\nto prevent or compensate for incontinence. If the urge tourinate becomes great before the bladder is full, somedrugs may be helpful, including propantheline bromide(Probanthine), oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan), orimipramine (Tofranil). Baclofen (Lioresal) may relax the\nsphincter muscle, allowing full emptying. Intermittentcatheterization is effective in controlling bladder dys-function. In this technique, a catheter is used to periodi-cally empty the bladder.\nSpasticity can be treated with oral medications,\nincluding baclofen and diazepam (Valium), or by injec-tion with botulinum toxin (Botox). Spasticity relief mayalso bring relief from chronic pain. Other more acutetypes of pain may respond to carbamazepine (Tegretol)or diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin). Low back pain is com-\nmon from increased use of the back muscles to compen-sate for weakened legs. Physical therapy and over-the-counter pain relievers may help.\nFatigue may be partially avoidable with changes in\nthe daily routine to allow more frequent rests. Amanta-dine (Symmetrel) and pemoline (Cylert) may improvealertness and lessen fatigue. Visual disturbances oftenrespond to corticosteroids. Other symptoms that may betreated with drugs include seizures, vertigo, and tremor.\nMyloral, an oral preparation of bovine myelin, has\nrecently been tested in clinical trials for its effectiveness inreducing the frequency and severity of relapses. Prelimi-nary data indicate no difference between it and placebo.\nAlternative treatment\nBee venom has been suggested as a treatment for\nMS, but no studies or objective reports support this claim.\nIn British studies, marijuana has been shown to have\nvariable effects on the symptoms of MS. Improvementshave been documented for tremor, pain, and spasticity,and worsening for posture and balance. Side effects haveincluded weakness, dizziness,relaxation, and incoordina-tion, as well as euphoria. As a result, marijuana is notrecommended as an alternative treatment.\nSome studies support the value of high doses of vita-\nmins ,minerals , and other dietary supplements for control-\nling disease progression or improving symptoms. Alpha-linoleic and linoleic acids, as well as selenium and vitaminE, have shown effectiveness in the treatment of MS. Theselenium and vitamin E act as antioxidants. In addition, theSwank diet (low in saturated fats), maintained over a longperiod of time, may retard the disease process.\nRemoval of mercury fillings has been touted as a\npossible cure, but is of no proven benefit.\nStudies have also shown that t’ai chi can be an effec-\ntive therapy for MS because it works to improve balanceand increase strength.\nThere are conflicting views about Echinacea and its\nbenefit to MS. Some medicine books recommend Echi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2253Multiple sclerosisnacea for people with MS. However, Echinacea appears\nto stimulate different parts of the immune system, partic-ularly immune cells known as macrophages. In MS thesecells are very active already and further stimulation couldworsen the disease.\nPrognosis\nIt is difficult to predict how multiple sclerosis will\nprogress in any one person. Most people with MS willbe able to continue to walk and function at their workfor many years after their diagnosis. The factors associ-ated with the mildest course of MS are being female,having the relapsing-remitting form, having the firstsymptoms at a younger age, having longer periods ofremission between relapses, and initial symptoms ofdecreased sensation or vision rather than of weakness orincoordination.KEY TERMS\nClinical trial —All new drugs undergo clinical tri-\nals before approval. Clinical trials are carefullyconducted tests in which effectiveness and sideeffects are studied, with the placebo effect elimi-nated.\nEvoked potentials —Tests that measure the brain’s\nelectrical response to stimulation of sensoryorgans (eyes or ears) or peripheral nerves (skin).These tests may help confirm the diagnosis of mul-tiple sclerosis.\nMyelin —A layer of insulation that surrounds the\nnerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord.\nPlaque —Patches of scar tissue that form where the\nlayer of yelin covering the nerve fibers is destroyedby the multiple sclerosis disease process.\nPrimary progressive —A pattern of symptoms of\nmultiple sclerosis in which the disease progresseswithout remission, or with occasional plateaus orslight improvements.\nRelapsing-remitting —A pattern of symptoms of\nmultiple sclerosis in which symptomatic attacksoccur that last 24 hours or more, followed bycomplete or almost complete improvement.\nSecondary progressive —A pattern of symptoms of\nmultiple sclerosis in which there are relapses andremissions, followed by more steady progressionof symptoms.Less than 5% of people with MS have a severe pro-\ngressive form, leading to death from complications with-\nin five years. At the other extreme, 10-20% have a benignform, with a very slow or no progression of their symp-toms. The most recent studies show that about seven outof 10 people with MS are still alive 25 years after theirdiagnosis, compared to about nine out of 10 people ofsimilar age without disease. On average, MS shortens thelives of affected women by about six years, and men by11 years. Suicide is a significant cause of death in MS,especially in younger patients.\nThe degree of disability a person experiences five\nyears after onset is, on average, about three-quarters ofthe expected disability at 10–15 years. A benign coursefor the first five years usually indicates the disease willnot cause marked disability.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent multiple sclerosis.\nUntil the cause of the disease is discovered, this isunlikely to change. Good nutrition; adequate rest; avoid-ance of stress , heat, and extreme physical exertion; and\ngood bladder hygiene may improve quality of life andreduce symptoms.\nResources\nBOOKS\nHolland, Nancy, T.

Typically, mumps is characterized by apainful swelling of both cheek areas, although the personcould have swelling on one side or no perceivableswelling at all. The salivary glands are also called theparotid glands, therefore, mumps is sometimes referredto as an inflammation of the parotid glands (epidemicparotitis). The word mumps comes from an old Englishdialect, meaning lumps or bumps within the cheeks.\nDescription\nMumps is a very contagious infection that spreads\neasily in highly populated areas, such as schools.Although not as contagious as measles or chickenpox ,\nmumps was once quite common. Prior to the release of amumps vaccine in the United States in 1967, approxi-mately 92% of all children had been exposed to mumpsby the age of 15. In these pre-vaccine years, most childrencontracted mumps between the ages of four and seven.Mumps epidemics came in two to five year cycles. Thegreatest mumps epidemic was in 1941 when approxi-mately 250 cases were reported for every 100,000 people.In 1968, the year after the live mumps vaccine wasreleased, only 76 cases were reported for every 100,000people. By 1985, less than 3,000 cases of mumps werereported throughout the entire United States, which worksout to about 1 case per 100,000 people. The reason for thedecline in mumps was the increased usage of the mumpsvaccine. However, 1987 noted a five-fold increase in theincidence of the disease because of the reluctance of somestates to adopt comprehensive school immunization laws.Since then, state-enforced school entry requirements haveachieved student immunization rates of nearly 100% inkindergarten and first grade. In 1996, the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported only 751cases of mumps nationwide, or, in other words, about onecase for every five million people.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe virus that causes mumps is harbored in the sali-\nva and is spread by sneezing, coughing, and other directcontact with another person’s infected saliva. Once theperson is exposed to the virus, symptoms generally occurin 14-24 days. Initial symptoms include chills,headache , loss of appetite, and a lack of energy. Howev-\ner, an infected person may not experience these initialsymptoms. Swelling of the salivary glands in the face(parotitis) generally occurs within 12-24 hours of theabove symptoms. Accompanying the swollen glands ispain on chewing or swallowing, especially with acidic\nbeverages, such as lemonade. A fever as high as 104°F\n(40°C) is also common. Swelling of the glands reaches amaximum on about the second day and usually disap-pears by the seventh day. Once a person has contractedmumps, they become immune to the disease, despite howmild or severe their symptoms may have been.\nWhile the majority of cases of mumps are uncompli-\ncated and pass without incident, some complications canoccur. Complications are, however, more noticeable inadults who get the infection. In 15% of cases, the cover-ing of the brain and spinal cord becomes inflamed(meningitis ). Symptoms of meningitis usually develop\nwithin four or five days after the first signs of mumps.These symptoms include a stiff neck, headache, vomit-ing, and a lack of energy. Mumps meningitis is usuallyresolved within seven days, and damage to the brain isexceedingly rare.\nThe mumps infection can spread into the brain caus-\ning inflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ). Symptoms\nof mumps encephalitis include the inability to feel pain,seizures, and high fever. Encephalitis can occur duringthe parotitis stage or one to two weeks later. Recoveryfrom mumps encephalitis is usually complete, althoughcomplications, such as seizure disorders, have beennoted. Only about 1 in 100 with mumps encephalitis diesfrom the complication.\nAbout one-quarter of all post-pubertal males who\ncontract mumps can develop a swelling of the scrotum(orchitis ) about seven days after the parotitis stage.\nSymptoms include marked swelling of one or both testi-cles, severe pain, fever, nausea, and headache. Pain andswelling usually subside after five to seven days,although the testicles can remain tender for weeks.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2255Mumps\nA young child with mumps. Photo Researchers. Reproduced\nby permission.)Diagnosis\nWhen mumps reaches epidemic proportions, diag-\nnosis is relatively easy, because swollen salivary glandsare so characteristic of the infection. With so many peo-ple vaccinated today, a case of mumps must be properlydiagnosed in the event the salivary glands are swollen forreasons other than viral infection. For example, in per-sons with poor oral hygiene , the salivary glands can be\ninfected with bacteria. In these cases, antibiotics are\nnecessary. Also in rare cases, the salivary glands canbecome blocked, develop tumors, or swell due to the useof certain drugs, such as iodine. A test can be performedto determine whether the person with swelling of thesalivary glands actually has the mumps virus.\nTreatment\nWhen mumps does occur, the illness is usually allowed\nto run its course. The symptoms, however, are treatable.Because of difficulty swallowing, the most important chal-lenge is to keep the patient fed and hydrated. The individualshould be provided a soft diet, consisting of cooked cereals,mashed potatoes, broth-based soups, prepared baby foods,or foods put through a home food processor. Aspirin ,\nacetaminophen , or ibuprofen can relieve some of the pain\ndue to swelling, headache, and fever. Avoid fruit juices andother acidic foods or beverages that can irritate the salivaryglands. Avoid dairy products that can be hard to digest. Inthe event of complications, a physician should be contactedat once. For example, if orchitis occurs, a physician shouldbe called. Also, supporting the scrotum in a cotton bed on anadhesive-tape bridge between the thighs can minimize ten-sion. Ice packs are also helpful.KEY TERMS\nAsymptomatic —Persons who carry a disease and\nmay be capable of transmitting the disease butwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease aresaid to be asymptomatic.\nEncephalitis —Inflammation of the brain.\nMeningitis —Inflammation of the membranes cov-\nering the brain and spinal cord.\nOrchitis —Inflammation or swelling of the scrotal\nsac containing the testicles.\nParotitis —Inflammation and swelling of the sali-\nvary glands.\nPost-pubertal —After puberty, in males approxi-\nmately after the age of 14 years.Alternative treatment\nAcupressure can be used effectively to relieve pain\ncaused by swollen glands. The patient can, by using themiddle fingers, gently press the area between the jaw-bone and the ear for two minutes while breathing deeply.\nA number of homeopathic remedies can be differen-\ntiated for the treatment of mumps. For example, bel-ladonna may be useful for flushing, redness, andswelling. Bryonia (wild hops) may be useful for irritabil-ity, lack of energy, or thirst. Phytolacca (poke root) maybe prescribed for extremely swollen glands. A homeo-pathic physician should always be consulted for appro-priate doses for children, and remedies that do not workwithin one day should be stopped. A homeopathic prepa-ration of the mumps virus can also be used prophylacti-cally or as a treatment for the disease.\nSeveral herbal remedies may be useful in helping the\nbody recover from the infection or may help alleviate thediscomfort associated with the disease. Echinacea ( Echi-\nnacea spp.) can be used to boost the immune system and\nhelp the body fight the infection. Other herbs taken inter-nally, such as cleavers ( Galium aparine ), calendula ( Cal-\nendula officinalis ), and phytolacca (poke root), target the\nlymphatic system and may help to enhance the activity ofthe body’s internal filtration system. Since phytolacca canbe toxic, it should only be used by patients under the careof a skilled practitioner. Topical applications are also use-ful in relieving the discomfort of mumps. A cloth dippedin a heated mixture of vinegar and cayenne ( Capsicum\nfrutescens ) can be wrapped around the neck several times\na day. Cleavers or calendula can also be combined withvinegar, heated, and applied in a similar manner.\nPrognosis\nWhen mumps is uncomplicated, prognosis is excellent.\nHowever, in rare cases, a relapse occurs after about twoweeks. Complications can also delay complete recovery.\nPrevention\nA vaccine exists to protect against mumps. The vac-\ncine preparation (MMR) is usually given as part of a com-bination injection that helps protect against measles,mumps, and rubella . MMR is a live vaccine administered\nin one dose between the ages of 12-15 months, four to sixyears, or 11-12 years. Persons who are unsure of theirmumps history and/or mumps vaccination history should\nbe vaccinated. Susceptible health care workers, especiallythose who work in hospitals, should be vaccinated.Because mumps is still prevalent throughout the world,susceptible persons over age one who are traveling abroadwould benefit from receiving the mumps vaccine.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2256MumpsThe mumps vaccine is extremely effective, and vir-\ntually everyone should be vaccinated against this disease.There are, however, a few reasons why people shouldNOT be vaccinated against mumps:\n• Pregnant women who contract mumps during pregnan-\ncyhave an increased rate of miscarriage , but not birth\ndefects . As a result, pregnant women should not receive\nthe mumps vaccine because of the possibility of damageto the fetus. Women who have had the vaccine shouldpostpone pregnancy for three months after vaccination.\n• Unvaccinated persons who have been exposed to\nmumps should not get the vaccine, as it may not provideprotection. The person should, however, be vaccinated ifno symptoms result from the exposure to mumps.\n• Persons with minor fever-producing illnesses, such as\nan upper respiratory infection, should not get the vac-cine until the illness has subsided.\n• Because mumps vaccine is produced using eggs, indi-\nviduals who develop hives , swelling of the mouth or\nthroat, dizziness , or breathing difficulties after eating\neggs should not receive the mumps vaccine.\n• Persons with immune deficiency diseases and/or those\nwhose immunity has been suppressed with anti-cancerdrugs, corticosteroids , or radiation should not receive\nthe vaccine. Family members of immunocompromisedpeople, however, should get vaccinated to reduce therisk of mumps.\n• The CDC recommends that all children infected with\nhuman immunodeficiency disease (HIV) who are\nasymptomatic should receive the MMR vaccine at 15months of age.\nRon Gasbarro, PharmD"

    "title": "Munchausen syndrome",
    "content": "Munchausen syndrome\nDefinition\nMunchausen syndrome is a psychiatric disorder that\ncauses an individual to self-inflict injury or illness or tofabricate symptoms of physical or mental illness, in orderto receive medical care or hospitalization. In a variation ofthe disorder, Munchausen by proxy (MSBP), an individ-ual, typically a mother, intentionally causes or fabricatesillness in a child or other person under her care.\nDescription\nMunchausen syndrome takes its name from Baron\nKarl Friederich von Munchausen, an 18th century Ger-man military man known for his tall tales. The disorderfirst appeared in psychiatric literature in the early 1950swhen it was used to describe patients who sought hospi-talization by inventing symptoms and complicated med-ical histories, and/or inducing illness and injury in them-selves. Categorized as a factitious disorder (a disorder inwhich the physical or psychological symptoms are undervoluntary control), Munchausen’s syndrome seems to bemotivated by a need to assume the role of a patient.Unlike malingering , there does not seem to be any clear\nsecondary gain (e.g., money) in Munchausen syndrome.\nIndividuals with Munchausen by proxy syndrome use\ntheir child (or another dependent person) to fulfill theirneed to step into the patient role. The disorder most com-monly victimizes children from birth to 8 years old. Par-ents with MSBP may only exaggerate or fabricate theirchild’s symptoms, or they may deliberately induce symp-toms through various methods, including poisoning , suf-\nfocation, starvation , or infecting the child’s bloodstream.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of Munchausen syndrome is\nunknown. It has been theorized that Munchausen patientsare motivated by a desire to be cared for, a need for atten-tion, dependency, an ambivalence toward doctors, or aneed to suffer. Factors that may predispose an individualto Munchausen’s include a serious illness in childhood oran existing personality disorder.\nThe Munchausen patient presents a wide array of\nphysical or psychiatric symptoms, usually limited only bytheir medical knowledge. Many Munchausen patients arevery familiar with medical terminology and symptoms.Some common complaints include fevers, rashes , abscess-\nes, bleeding, and vomiting. Common Munchausen byproxy symptoms include apnea (cessation of breathing),fever , vomiting, and diarrhea . In both Munchausen and\nMSBP syndromes, the suspected illness does not respondto a normal course of treatment. Patients or parents maypush for invasive diagnostic procedures and display anextraordinary depth of knowledge of medical procedures.\nDiagnosis\nBecause Munchausen sufferers often go from doctor\nto doctor, gaining admission into many hospitals alongthe way, diagnosis can be difficult. They are typicallydetected rather than diagnosed. During a course of treat-ment, they may be discovered by a hospital employeewho encountered them during a previous hospitalization.Their caregivers may also notice that symptoms such ashigh fever occur only when the patient is left unattended.Occasionally, unprescribed medication used to inducesymptoms is found with the patient’s belongings. Whenthe patient is confronted, they often react with outrage\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2257Munchausen syndromeand check out of the hospital to seek treatment at another\nfacility with a new caregiver.\nTreatment\nThere is no clearly effective treatment for Mun-\nchausen syndrome. Extensive psychotherapy may behelpful with some Munchausen patients. If Munchausensyndrome co-exists with other mental disorders, such asa personality disorder, the underlying disorder is typical-ly treated first.\nPrognosis\nThe infections and injuries Munchausen patients self-\ninflict can cause serious illness. Patients often undergocountless unnecessary surgeries throughout their lifetimes.In addition, because of their frequent hospitalizations, theyhave difficulty holding down a job. Further, their chronichealth complaints may damage interpersonal relationshipswith family and friends. Children victimized by sufferersof MSBP are at a real risk for serious injury and possibledeath . Those who survive physically unscathed may suf-\nfer developmental problems later in life.\nPrevention\nBecause the cause of Munchausen syndrome is\nunknown, formulating a prevention strategy is difficult.Some medical facilities and healthcare practitioners haveattempted to limit hospital admissions for Munchausenpatients by sharing medical records. While theseattempts may curb the number of hospital admissions,they do not treat the underlying disorder and may endan-ger Munchausen sufferers that have made themselvescritically ill and require treatment. Children who arefound to be victims of persons with Munchausen byproxy syndrome should be immediately removed fromthe care of the abusing parent or guardian.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

    "title": "Muscle spasms and cramps",
    "content": "Muscle spasms and cramps\nDefinition\nMuscle spasms and cramps are spontaneous, often\npainful muscle contractions.\nDescription\nMost people are familiar with the sudden pain of a\nmuscle cramp. The rapid, uncontrolled contraction, orspasm, happens unexpectedly, with either no stimulationor some trivially small one. The muscle contraction andpain last for several minutes, and then slowly ease.Cramps may affect any muscle, but are most common inthe calves, feet, and hands. While painful, they are harm-less, and in most cases, not related to any underlying dis-order. Nonetheless, cramps and spasms can be manifesta-tions of many neurological or muscular diseases.\nThe terms cramp and spasm can be somewhat vague,\nand they are sometimes used to include types of abnor-mal muscle activity other than sudden painful contrac-tion. These include stiffness at rest, slow muscle relax-ation, and spontaneous contractions of a muscle at rest(fasciculation). Fasciculation is a type of painless musclespasm, marked by rapid, uncoordinated contraction ofmany small muscle fibers. A critical part of diagnosis isto distinguish these different meanings and to allow thepatient to describe the problem as precisely as possible.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nNormal voluntary muscle contraction begins when\nelectrical signals are sent from the brain through thespinal cord along nerve cells called motor neurons. Theseinclude both the upper motor neurons within the brain andthe lower motor neurons within the spinal cord and lead-ing out to the muscle. At the muscle, chemicals releasedby the motor neuron stimulate the internal release of cal-cium ions from stores within the muscle cell. These calci-um ions then interact with muscle proteins within the cell,causing the proteins (actin and myosin) to slide past oneanother. This motion pulls their fixed ends closer, therebyshortening the cell and, ultimately, the muscle itself.Recapture of calcium and unlinking of actin and myosinallows the muscle fiber to relax.\nAbnormal contraction may be caused by abnormal\nactivity at any stage in this process. Certain mechanismswithin the brain and the rest of the central nervous systemhelp regulate contraction. Interruption of these mecha-nisms can cause spasm. Motor neurons that are overly sen-sitive may fire below their normal thresholds. The musclemembrane itself may be over-sensitive, causing contrac-tion without stimulation. Calcium ions may not be recap-tured quickly enough, causing prolonged contraction.\nInteruption of brain mechanisms and overly sensi-\ntive motor neurons may result from damage to the nervepathways. Possible causes include stroke ,multiple scle-\nrosis ,cerebral palsy , neurodegenerative diseases, trau-\nma, spinal cord injury , and nervous system poisons\nsuch as strychnine, tetanus , and certain insecticides.\nNerve damage may lead to a prolonged or permanentmuscle shortening called contracture.\nChanges in muscle responsiveness may be due to or\nassociated with:\n• Prolonged exercise . Curiously, relaxation of a muscle\nactually requires energy to be expended. The energy isused to recapture calcium and to unlink actin andmyosin. Normally, sensations of pain and fatigue sig-\nnal that it is time to rest. Ignoring or overriding thosewarning signals can lead to such severe energy deple-tion that the muscle cannot be relaxed, causing a cramp.The familiar advice about not swimming after a heavymeal, when blood flow is directed away from the mus-cles, is intended to avoid this type of cramp. Rigor mor-tis, the stiffness of a corpse within the first 24 hoursafter death , is also due to this phenomenon.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2260Muscle spasms and cramps•Dehydration and salt depletion. This may be brought\non by protracted vomiting or diarrhea , or by copious\nsweating during prolonged exercise, especially in hightemperatures. Loss of fluids and salts—especially sodi-um, potassium, magnesium, and calcium—can disruption balances in both muscle and nerves. This can pre-vent them from responding and recovering normally,and can lead to cramp.\n• Metabolic disorders that affect the energy supply in\nmuscle. These are inherited diseases in which particularmuscle enzymes are deficient. They include deficien-cies of myophosphorylase (McArdle’s disease), phos-phorylase b kinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglyc-erate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase.\n• Myotonia. This causes stiffness due to delayed relaxation\nof the muscle, but does not cause the spontaneous con-traction usually associated with cramps. However, manypatients with myotonia do experience cramping fromexercise. Symptoms of myotonia are often worse in thecold. Myotonias include myotonic dystrophy , myotonia\ncongenita, paramyotonia congenita, and neuromyotonia.\nFasciculations may be due to fatigue, cold, medica-\ntions, metabolic disorders, nerve damage, or neurodegen-erative disease, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .\nMost people experience brief, mild fasciculations fromtime to time, usually in the calves.\nSymptoms\nThe pain of a muscle cramp is intense, localized, and\noften debilitating. Coming on quickly, it may last forminutes and fade gradually. Contractures develop more\nslowly, over days or weeks, and may be permanent ifuntreated. Fasciculations may occur at rest or after mus-cle contraction, and may last several minutes.\nDiagnosis\nAbnormal contractions are diagnosed through a\ncareful medical history, physical and neurological exami-nation, and electromyography of the affected muscles.\nElectromyography records electrical activity in the mus-cle during rest and movement.\nTreatment\nMost cases of simple cramps require no treatment\nother than patience and stretching. Gently and graduallystretching and massaging the affected muscle may easethe pain and hasten recovery.\nMore prolonged or regular cramps may be treated\nwith drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, or qui-nine. Fluid and salt replacement, either orally or intra-venously, is used to treat dehydration. Treatment ofKEY TERMS\nMotor neuron —Nerve cells within the central ner-\nvous system that carry nerve impulses controllingmuscle movement.\nunderlying metabolic or neurologic disease, where possi-\nble, may help relieve symptoms.\nAlternative treatment\nCramps may be treated or prevented with Gingko\n(Ginkgo biloba ) or Japanese quince ( Chaenomeles spe-\nciosa ). Supplements of vitamin E, niacin, calcium, and\nmagnesium may also help. Taken at bedtime, they mayhelp to reduce the likelihood of night cramps.\nPrognosis\nOccasional cramps are common, and have no special\nmedical significance.\nPrevention\nThe likelihood of developing cramps may be\nreduced by eating a healthy diet with appropriate levelsof minerals , and getting regular exercise to build up\nenergy reserves in muscle. Avoiding exercising inextreme heat helps prevent heat cramps. Heat cramps canalso be avoided by taking salt tablets and water beforeprolonged exercise in extreme heat.

    "title": "Muscular dystrophy",
    "content": "Muscular dystrophy\nDefinition\nMuscular dystrophy is the name for a group of\ninherited disorders in which strength and muscle bulkgradually decline. Nine types of muscular dystrophiesare generally recognized.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2261Muscular dystrophyDescription\nThe muscular dystrophies include:\n• Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): DMD affects\nyoung boys, causing progressive muscle weakness,usually beginning in the legs. It is the most severe formof muscular dystrophy. DMD occurs in about 1 in 3,500male births, and affects approximately 8,000 boys andyoung men in the United States. A milder form occursin very few female carriers.\n• Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD): BMD affects older\nboys and young men, following a milder course thanDMD. BMD occurs in about 1 in 30,000 male births.\n• Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD): EDMD\naffects young boys, causing contractures and weak-\nness in the calves, weakness in the shoulders and upperarms, and problems in the way electrical impulses trav-el through the heart to make it beat (heart conductiondefects). Fewer than 300 cases of EDMD have beenidentified.\n• Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD): LGMD\nbegins in late childhood to early adulthood and affectsboth men and women, causing weakness in the musclesaround the hips and shoulders. It is the most variable ofthe muscular dystrophies, and there are several differentforms of the disease now recognized. Many people withsuspected LGMD have probably been misdiagnosed inthe past, and therefore the prevalence of the disease isdifficult to estimate. The number of people affected inthe United States may be in the low thousands.\n• Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSH): FSH,\nalso known as Landouzy-Dejerine disease, begins inlate childhood to early adulthood and affects both menand women, causing weakness in the muscles of theface, shoulders, and upper arms. The hips and legs mayalso be affected. FSH occurs in about 1 out of every20,000 people, and affects approximately 13,000 peo-ple in the United States.\n•Myotonic dystrophy : also known as Steinert’s disease,\naffects both men and women, causing generalizedweakness first seen in the face, feet, and hands. It isaccompanied by the inability to relax the affected mus-cles (myotonia). Symptoms may begin from birththrough adulthood. It is the most common form of mus-cular dystrophy, affecting more than 30,000 people inthe United States.\n• Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD): OPMD\naffects adults of both sexes, causing weakness in theeye muscles and throat. It is most common amongFrench Canadian families in Quebec, and in Spanish-American families in the southwestern United States.• Distal muscular dystrophy (DD): DD begins in middle\nage or later, causing weakness in the muscles of the feetand hands. It is most common in Sweden, and rare inother parts of the world.\n• Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD): CMD is pre-\nsent from birth, results in generalized weakness, andusually progresses slowly. A subtype, called FukuyamaCMD, also involves mental retardation . Both are rare;\nFukuyama CMD is more common in Japan.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nSeveral of the muscular dystrophies, including\nDMD, BMD, CMD, and most forms of LGMD, are dueto defects in the genes for a complex of muscle proteins.This complex spans the muscle cell membrane to unite afibrous network on the interior of the cell with a fibrousnetwork on the outside. Current theory holds that bylinking these two networks, the complex acts as a “shockabsorber,” redistributing and evening out the forces gen-erated by contraction of the muscle, thereby preventingrupture of the muscle membrane. Defects in the proteinsof the complex lead to deterioration of the muscle.Symptoms of these diseases set in as the muscle gradual-ly exhausts its ability to repair itself. Both DMD andBMD are caused by flaws in the gene for the proteincalled dystrophin. The flaw leading to DMD prevents theformation of any dystrophin, while that of BMD allowssome protein to be made, accounting for the differencesin severity and onset between the two diseases. Differ-ences among the other diseases in the muscles involvedand the ages of onset are less easily explained.\nThe causes of the other muscular dystrophies are not\nas well understood:\n• One form of LGMD is caused by defects in the gene for\na muscle enzyme, calpain. The relationship betweenthis defect and the symptoms of the disease is unclear.\n• EDMD is due to a defect in the gene for a protein called\nemerin, which is found in the membrane of a cell’snucleus, but whose exact function is unknown.\n• Myotonic dystrophy is linked to gene defects for a pro-\ntein that may control the flow of charged particles with-in muscle cells. This gene defect is called a triplerepeat, meaning it contains extra triplets of DNA code.It is possible that this mutation affects nearby genes aswell, and that the widespread symptoms of myotonicdystrophy are due to a range of genetic disruptions.\n• The gene for OPMD appears to also be mutated with a\ntriple repeat. The function of the affected protein mayinvolve translation of genetic messages in a cell’s nucleus.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2262Muscular dystrophy• The cause of FSH is unknown. Although the genetic\nregion responsible for it has been localized on its chro-mosome, the identity and function of the gene or genesinvolved had not been determined as of 1997.\n• The gene responsible for DD has not yet been found.\nGenetics and patterns of inheritance\nThe muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases,\nmeaning they are caused by defects in genes. Genes,which are linked together on chromosomes, have twofunctions: They code for the production of proteins, andthey are the material of inheritance. Parents pass alonggenes to their children, providing them with a completeset of instructions for making their own proteins.\nBecause both parents contribute genetic material to\ntheir offspring, each child carries two copies of almostevery gene, one from each parent. For some diseases tooccur, both copies must be flawed. Such diseases arecalled autosomal recessive diseases. Some forms ofLGMD and DD exhibit this pattern of inheritance, asdoes CMD. A person with only one flawed copy, called acarrier, will not have the disease, but may pass the flawedgene on to his children. When two carriers have children,the chances of having a child with the disease is one infour for each pregnancy .\nOther diseases occur when only one flawed gene\ncopy is present. Such diseases are called autosomal dom-inant diseases. Other forms of LGMD exhibit this patternof inheritance, as do DM, FSH, OPMD, and some formsof DD. When a person affected by the disease has a childwith someone not affected, the chances of having anaffected child is one in two.\nBecause of chromosomal differences between the\nsexes, some genes are not present in two copies. The chro-mosomes that determine whether a person is male orfemale are called the X and Y chromosomes. A personwith two X chromosomes is female, while a person withone X and one Y is male. While the X chromosome carriesmany genes, the Y chromosome carries almost none.Therefore, a male has only one copy of each gene on the Xchromosome, and if it is flawed, he will have the diseasethat defect causes. Such diseases are said to be X-linked.X-linked diseases include DMD, BMD, and EDMD.Women aren’t usually affected by X-linked diseases, sincethey will likely have one unaffected copy between the twochromosomes. Some female carriers of DMD suffer amild form of the disease, probably because their one unaf-fected gene copy is shut down in some of their cells.\nWomen carriers of X-linked diseases have a one in\ntwo chance of passing the flawed gene on to each childborn. Daughters who inherit the disease gene will be car-riers. A son born without the disease gene will be free of\nthe disease and cannot pass it on to his children. A sonborn with the defect will have the disease. He will passthe flawed gene on to each of his daughters, who willthen be carriers, but to none of his sons (because theyinherit his Y chromosome).\nNot all genetic flaws are inherited. As many as one\nthird of the cases of DMD are due to new mutations thatarise during egg formation in the mother. New mutationsare less common in other forms of muscular dystrophy.\nSymptoms\nAll of the muscular dystrophies are marked by mus-\ncle weakness as the major symptom. The distribution ofsymptoms, age of onset, and progression differ signifi-cantly. Pain is sometimes a symptom of each, usually\ndue to the effects of weakness on joint position.\nDMD. A boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nusually begins to show symptoms as a pre-schooler. Thelegs are affected first, making walking difficult and caus-ing balance problems. Most patients walk three to sixmonths later than expected and have difficulty running.Later on, the boy with DMD will push his hands againsthis knees to rise to a standing position, to compensate forleg weakness. About the same time, his calves will beginto swell, though with fibrous tissue rather than with mus-cle, and feel firm and rubbery; this condition gives DMDone of its alternate names, pseudohypertrophic musculardystrophy. He will widen his stance to maintain balance,and walk with a waddling gait to advance his weakenedlegs. Contractures (permanent muscle tightening) usuallybegin by age five or six, most severely in the calf mus-cles. This pulls the foot down and back, forcing the boyto walk on tip-toes, called equinus, and further decreasesbalance. Frequent falls and broken bones are commonbeginning at this age. Climbing stairs and rising unaidedmay become impossible by age nine or ten, and mostboys use a wheelchair for mobility by the age of 12.Weakening of the trunk muscles around this age oftenleads to scoliosis (a side-to-side spine curvature) and\nkyphosis (a front-to-back curvature).\nThe most serious weakness of DMD is weakness of\nthe diaphragm, the sheet of muscles at the top of theabdomen that perform the main work of breathing andcoughing. Diaphragm weakness leads to reduced energyand stamina, and increased lung infection because of theinability to cough effectively. Young men with DMD\noften live into their twenties and beyond, provided theyhave mechanical ventilation assistance and good respira-tory hygiene.\nAbout one third of boys with DMD experience spe-\ncific learning disabilities, including trouble learning by\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2263Muscular dystrophyear rather than by sight and trouble paying attention to\nlong lists of instructions. Individualized educational pro-grams usually compensate well for these disabilities.\nBMD. The symptoms of BMD usually appear in late\nchildhood to early adulthood. Though the progression ofsymptoms may parallel that of DMD, the symptoms areusually milder and the course more variable. The same pat-tern of leg weakness, unsteadiness, and contractures occurlater for the young man with BMD, often allowing indepen-dent walking into the twenties or early thirties. Scoliosismay occur, but is usually milder and progresses more slow-ly. Heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), occurs morecommonly in BMD. Problems may include irregular heart-beats ( arrhythmias ) and congestive heart failure . Symp-\ntoms may include fatigue ,shortness of breath , chest pain,\nand dizziness . Respiratory weakness also occurs, and may\nlead to the need for mechanical ventilation.\nEDMD. This type of muscular dystrophy usually\nbegins in early childhood, often with contractures preced-ing muscle weakness. Weakness affects the shoulder andupper arm originally, along with the calf muscles, leadingto foot-drop. Most men with EDMD survive into middleage, although a defect in the heart’s rhythm ( heart block )\nmay be fatal if not treated with a pacemaker.\nLGMD. While there are at least a half-dozen genes\nthat cause the various types of LGMD, two major clinicalforms of LGMD are usually recognized. A severe child-hood form is similar in appearance to DMD, but is inherit-ed as an autosomal recessive trait. Symptoms of adult-onset LGMD usually appear in a person’s teens or twen-ties, and are marked by progressive weakness and wastingof the muscles closest to the trunk. Contractures mayoccur, and the ability to walk is usually lost about 20 yearsafter onset. Some people with LGMD develop respiratoryweakness that requires use of a ventilator. Lifespan may besomewhat shortened. (Autosomal dominant forms usuallyoccur later in life and progress relatively slowly.)\nFSH. FSH varies in its severity and age of onset,\neven among members of the same family. Symptomsmost commonly begin in the teens or early twenties,though infant or childhood onset is possible. Symptomstend to be more severe in those with earlier onset. Thedisease is named for the regions of the body most severe-ly affected by the disease: muscles of the face (facio-),shoulders (scapulo-), and upper arms (humeral). Hipsand legs may be affected as well. Children with FSHoften develop partial or complete deafness.\nThe first symptom noticed is often difficulty lifting\nobjects above the shoulders. The weakness may be greateron one side than the other. Shoulder weakness also causesthe shoulder blades to jut backward, called scapular wing-ing. Muscles in the upper arm often lose bulk sooner than\nthose of the forearm, giving a “Popeye” appearance to thearms. Facial weakness may lead to loss of facial expres-sion, difficulty closing the eyes completely, and inabilityto drink through a straw, blow up a balloon, or whistle. Aperson with FSH may not develop strong facial wrinkles.Contracture of the calf muscles may cause foot-drop, lead-ing to frequent tripping over curbs or rough spots. Peoplewith earlier onset often require a wheelchair for mobility,while those with later onset rarely do.\nMYOTONIC DYSTROPHY. Symptoms of Myotonic\ndystrophy include facial weakness and a slack jaw, droop-ing eyelids ( ptosis ), and muscle wasting in the forearms\nand calves. A person with this dystrophy has difficultyrelaxing his grasp, especially if the object is cold.Myotonic dystrophy affects heart muscle, causingarrhythmias and heart block, and the muscles of thedigestive system, leading to motility disorders and consti-\npation . Other body systems are affected as well: Myoton-\nic dystrophy may cause cataracts , retinal degeneration,\nlow IQ, frontal balding, skin disorders, testicular atrophy,sleep apnea , and insulin resistance. An increased need or\ndesire for sleep is common, as is diminished motivation.Severe disability affects most people with this type ofdystrophy within 20 years of onset, although most do notrequire a wheelchair even late in life.\nOPMD. OPMD usually begins in a person’s thirties\nor forties, with weakness in the muscles controlling theeyes and throat. Symptoms include drooping eyelids, dif-ficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and weakness progressesto other muscles of the face, neck, and occasionally theupper limbs. Swallowing difficulty may cause aspiration,or the introduction of food or saliva into the airways.Pneumonia may follow.\nDD. DD usually begins in the twenties or thirties,\nwith weakness in the hands, forearms, and lower legs. Dif-ficulty with fine movements such as typing or fasteningbuttons may be the first symptoms. Symptoms progressslowly, and the disease usually does not affect life span.\nCMD. CMD is marked by severe muscle weakness\nfrom birth, with infants displaying “floppiness” and verylittle voluntary movement. Nonetheless, a child withCMD may learn to walk, either with or without someassistive device, and live into young adulthood orbeyond. In contrast, children with Fukuyama CMD arerarely able to walk, and have severe mental retardation.Most children with this type of CMD die in childhood.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of muscular dystrophy involves a careful\nmedical history and a thorough physical exam to deter-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2264Muscular dystrophymine the distribution of symptoms and to rule out other\ncauses. Family history may give important clues, sinceall the muscular dystrophies are genetic conditions(though no family history will be evident in the event ofnew mutations).\nLab tests may include:\n• Blood level of the muscle enzyme creatine kinase (CK).\nCK levels rise in the blood due to muscle damage, andmay be seen in some conditions even before symptomsappear.\n• Muscle biopsy, in which a small piece of muscle tissue\nis removed for microscopic examination. Changes inthe structure of muscle cells and presence of fibrous tis-sue or other aberrant structures are characteristic of dif-ferent forms of muscular dystrophy. The muscle tissuecan also be stained to detect the presence or absence ofparticular proteins, including dystrophin.\n• Electromyogram (EMG). This electrical test is used to\nexamine the response of the muscles to stimulation.Decreased response is seen in muscular dystrophy.Other characteristic changes are seen in DM.KEY TERMS\nAutosomal dominant —Diseases that occur when a\nperson inherits only one flawed copy of the gene.\nAutosomal recessive —Diseases that occur when a\nperson inherits two flawed copies of a gene—onefrom each parent.\nBecker muscular dystrophy (BMD) —A type of mus-\ncular dystrophy that affects older boys and men,and usually follows a milder course than DMD.\nContractures —A permanent shortening (as of mus-\ncle, tendon, or scar tissue) producing deformity ordistortion.\nDistal muscular dystrophy (DD) —A form of mus-\ncular dystrophy that usually begins in middle age orlater, causing weakness in the muscles of the feetand hands.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) —The most\nsevere form of muscular dystrophy, DMD usuallyaffects young boys and causes progressive muscleweakness, usually beginning in the legs.\nDystrophin —A protein that helps muscle tissue\nrepair itself. Both DMD and BMD are caused byflaws in the gene that instructs the body how to\nmake this protein.\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSH) —\nThis form of muscular dystrophy, also known asLandouzy-Dejerine disease, begins in late child-hood to early adulthood and affects both men andwomen, causing weakness in the muscles of theface, shoulders, and upper arms.\nLimb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) —This\nform of muscular dystrophy begins in late child-hood to early adulthood and affects both men andwomen, causing weakness in the muscles aroundthe hips and shoulders.\nMyotonic dystrophy —This type of muscular dystro-\nphy, also known as Steinert’s disease, affects bothmen and women, causing generalized weaknessfirst seen in the face, feet, and hands. It is accompa-nied by the inability to relax the affected muscles(myotonia).\nOculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) —\nThis type of muscular dystrophy affects adults ofboth sexes, causing weakness in the eye musclesand throat.\n• Genetic tests. Several of the muscular dystrophies can\nbe positively identified by testing for the presence ofthe mutated gene involved. Accurate genetic tests areavailable for DMD, BMD, DM, several forms ofLGMD, and EDMD.\n• Other specific tests as necessary. For EDMD and BMD,\nfor example, an electrocardiogram may be needed totest heart function, and hearing tests are performed forchildren with FSH.\nFor most forms of muscular dystrophy, accurate\ndiagnosis is not difficult when done by someone familiarwith the range of diseases. There are exceptions, howev-er. Even with a muscle biopsy, it may be difficult to dis-tinguish between FSH and another muscle disease,polymyositis . Childhood-onset LGMD is often mistaken\nfor the much more common DMD, especially when itoccurs in boys. BMD with an early onset appears verysimilar to DMD, and a genetic test may be needed toaccurately distinguish them. The muscular dystrophiesmay be confused with diseases involving the motor neu-rons, such as spinal muscular atrophy; diseases of theneuromuscular junction, such as myasthenia gravis ; and\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2265Muscular dystrophyother muscle diseases, as all involve generalized weaken-\ning of varying distribution.\nTreatment\nDrugs\nThere are no cures for any of the muscular dystro-\nphies. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, has been shown todelay the progression of DMD somewhat, for reasonsthat are still unclear. Prednisone is also prescribed forBMD, though no controlled studies have tested its bene-fit. A related drug, deflazacort, appears to have similarbenefits with fewer side effects. It is available and is pre-scribed in Canada and Mexico, but is unavailable in theUnited States. Albuterol, an adrenergic agonist, hasshown some promise for FSH in small trials; larger trialsare scheduled for 1998. No other drugs are currentlyknown to have an effect on the course of any other mus-cular dystrophy.\nTreatment of muscular dystrophy is mainly directed\nat preventing the complications of weakness, includingdecreased mobility and dexterity, contractures, scoliosis,heart defects, and respiratory insufficiency.\nPhysical therapy\nPhysical therapy, in particular regular stretching, is\nused to maintain the range of motion of affected musclesand to prevent or delay contractures. Braces are used aswell, especially on the ankles and feet to prevent equi-nus. Full-leg braces may be used in DMD to prolong theperiod of independent walking. Strengthening other mus-cle groups to compensate for weakness may be possibleif the affected muscles are few and isolated, as in the ear-lier stages of the milder muscular dystrophies. Regular,nonstrenuous exercise helps maintain general good\nhealth. Strenuous exercise is usually not recommended,since it may damage muscles further.\nSurgery\nWhen contractures become more pronounced, tenoto-\nmy surgery may be performed. In this operation, the ten-don of the contractured muscle is cut, and the limb isbraced in its normal resting position while the tendonregrows. In FSH, surgical fixation of the scapula can helpcompensate for shoulder weakness. For a person withOPMD, surgical lifting of the eyelids may help compen-sate for weakened muscular control. For a person withDM, sleep apnea may be treated surgically to maintain anopen airway. Scoliosis surgery is often needed in DMD,but much less often in other muscular dystrophies. Surgeryis recommended at a much lower degree of curvature forDMD than for scoliosis due to other conditions, since thedecline in respiratory function in DMD makes surgery at a\nlater time dangerous. In this surgery, the vertebrae arefused together to maintain the spine in the upright posi-tion. Steel rods are inserted at the time of operation to keepthe spine rigid while the bones grow together.\nWhen any type of surgery is performed in patients\nwith muscular dystrophy, anesthesia must be carefullyselected. People with MD are susceptible to a severereaction, known as malignant hyperthermia, when givenhalothane anesthetic.\nOccupational therapy\nThe occupational therapist suggests techniques and\ntools to compensate for the loss of strength and dexterity.Strategies may include modifications in the home, adap-tive utensils and dressing aids, compensatory movementsand positioning, wheelchair accessories, or communica-tion aids.\nNutrition\nGood nutrition helps to promote general health in\nall the muscular dystrophies. No special diet or supple-ment has been shown to be of use in any of the condi-tions. The weakness in the throat muscles seen especiallyin OPMD and later DMD may necessitate the use of agastrostomy tube, inserted in the stomach to provide\nnutrition directly.\nCardiac care\nThe arrhythmias of EDMD and BMD may be treat-\nable with antiarrhythmia drugs such as mexiletine ornifedipine. A pacemaker may be implanted if these donot provide adequate control. Heart transplants areincreasingly common for men with BMD.\nRespiratory care\nPeople who develop weakness of the diaphragm or\nother ventilatory muscles may require a mechanical ven-tilator to continue breathing deeply enough. Air may beadministered through a nasal mask or mouthpiece, orthrough a tracheostomy tube, which is inserted through asurgical incision through the neck and into the windpipe.Most people with muscular dystrophy do not need a tra-cheostomy, although some may prefer it to continual useof a mask or mouthpiece. Supplemental oxygen is notneeded. Good hygiene of the lungs is critical for healthand longterm survival of a person with weakened ventila-tory muscles. Assisted cough techniques provide thestrength needed to clear the airways of secretions; anassisted cough machine is also available and providesexcellent results.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2266Muscular dystrophyExperimental treatments\nTwo experimental procedures aiming to cure DMD\nhave attracted a great deal of attention in the past decade.In myoblast transfer, millions of immature muscle cellsare injected into an affected muscle. The goal of the treat-ment is to promote the growth of the injected cells, replac-ing the defective host cells with healthy new ones. Despitecontinued claims to the contrary by a very few researchers,this procedure is widely judged a failure. Modifications inthe technique may change that in the future.\nGene therapy introduces good copies of the dys-\ntrophin gene into muscle cells. The goal is to allow theexisting muscle cells to use the new gene to produce thedystrophin it cannot make with its flawed gene. Problemshave included immune rejection of the virus used to intro-duce the gene, loss of gene function after several weeks,and an inability to get the gene to enough cells to make afunctional difference in the affected muscle. Nonetheless,after a number of years of refining the techniques in mice,researchers are beginning human trials in 1998.\nPrognosis\nThe expected lifespan for a male with DMD has\nincreased significantly in the past two decades. Mostyoung men will live into their early or mid-twenties. Res-piratory infections become an increasing problem astheir breathing becomes weaker, and these infections areusually the cause of death .\nThe course of the other muscular dystrophies is\nmore variable; expected life spans and degrees of dis-ability are hard to predict, but may be related to age ofonset and initial symptoms. Prediction is made more dif-ficult because, as new genes are discovered, it is becom-ing clear that several of the dystrophies are not uniformdisorders, but rather symptom groups caused by differ-ent genes.\nPeople with dystrophies with significant heart\ninvolvement (BMD, EDMD, Myotonic dystrophy) maynonetheless have almost normal life spans, provided thatcardiac complications are monitored and treated aggres-sively. The respiratory involvement of BMD and LGMDsimilarly require careful and prompt treatment.\nPrevention\nThere is no way to prevent any of the muscular dys-\ntrophies in a person who has the genes responsible forthese disorders. Accurate genetic tests, including prenataltests, are available for some of the muscular dystrophies.Results of these tests may be useful for purposes of fami-ly planning.Resources\nBOOKS\nBrooke, Michael H.

    "title": "Mushroom poisoning",
    "content": "Mushroom poisoning\nDefinition\nMushroom poisoning refers to the severe and often\ndeadly effects of various toxins that are found in certaintypes of mushrooms. One type known as Amanita phal-\nloides , appropriately called “death cap,” accounts for the\nmajority of cases. The toxins initially cause severeabdominal cramping, vomiting, and watery diarrhea ,\nand then lead to liver and kidney failure.\nDescription\nThe highest reported incidences of mushroom poi-\nsoning occur in western Europe, where a popular pastimeis amateur mushroom hunting. Since the 1970s, the Unit-ed States has seen a marked increase in mushroom poi-soning due to an increase in the popularity of “natural”foods, the use of mushrooms as recreational hallucino-gens, and the gourmet qualities of wild mushrooms.About 90% of the deaths due to mushroom poisoning inthe United States and western Europe result from eatingAmanita phalloides . This mushroom is recognized by its\nmetallic green cap (the color may vary from light yellowto greenish brown), white gills (located under the cap),white stem, and bulb-shaped structure at the base of thestem. A pure white variety of this species also occurs.Poisoning results from ingestion of as few as one to threemushrooms. Higher death (mortality) rates of more than\n50% occur in children less than 10 years of age.\nCauses and symptoms\nPoisonous mushrooms contain at least two different\ntypes of toxins, each of which can cause death if taken inlarge enough quantities. Some of the toxins found in poi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2267Mushroom poisoningsonous mushrooms are among the most potent ever dis-\ncovered. One group of poisons, known as amatoxins,blocks the production of DNA, the basis of cell reproduc-tion. This leads to the death of many cells, especiallythose that reproduce frequently such as in the liver,intestines, and kidney. Other mushroom poisons affectthe proteins needed for muscle contraction, and thereforereduce the ability of certain muscle groups to perform.\nSymptoms of Amanita poisoning occur in different\nstages or phases. These include:\n• First phase. Abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting,\nand severe watery diarrhea occur anywhere from 6-24hours after eating the mushroom and last for about 24hours. These intestinal symptoms can lead to dehydra-\ntion and low blood pressure (hypotension).\n• Second phase. A period of remission of symptoms that\nlasts 1-2 days. During this time, the patient feels better,but blood tests begin to show evidence of liver and kid-ney damage.\n• Third phase. Liver and kidney failure develop at this\npoint and either lead to death within about a week orrecovery within two to three weeks.\nOther symptoms are due to either a decrease in\nblood clotting factors that leads to internal bleeding orreduced muscle function, with the development of weak-\nness and paralysis .\nDiagnosis\nIn most cases, the fact that the patient has recently\neaten wild mushrooms is the clue to the cause of symp-toms. Moreover, the identification of any remainingmushrooms by a qualified mushroom specialist (mycolo-gist) can be a key to diagnosis. When in doubt, the toxinknown as alpha-amantin can be found in the blood, urine,or stomach contents of an individual who has ingestedpoisonous Amanita mushrooms.\nTreatment\nIt is important to remember that there is no specific\nantidote for mushroom poisoning. However, severaladvances in therapy have decreased the death rate overthe last several years. Early replacement of lost body flu-ids has been a major factor in improving survival rates.\nTherapy is aimed at decreasing the amount of toxin\nin the body. Initially, attempts are made to remove toxinsfrom the upper gastrointestinal tract by inducing vomit-ing or by gastric lavage (stomach pumping). After thatcontinuous aspiration of the upper portion of the smallintestine through a nasogastric tube is done and oralcharcoal (every four hours for 48 hours) is given to pre-vent absorption of toxin. These measures work best ifstarted within six hours of ingestion.\nIn the United States, early removal of mushroom\npoison by way of an artificial kidney machine (dialysis)has become part of the treatment program. This is com-bined with the correction of any imbalances of salts(electrolytes) dissolved in the blood, such as sodium orpotassium. An enzyme called thioctic acid and corticos-\nteroids also appear to be beneficial, as well as high doses\nof penicillin. In Europe, a chemical taken from the milkthistle plant, Silybum marianum , is also part of treat-\nment. When liver failure develops, liver transplantation\nmay be the only treatment option.\nPrognosis\nThe mortality rate has decreased with improved and\nrapid treatment. However, according to some medicalreports death still occurs in 20-30% of cases, with a high-er mortality rate of 50% in children less than 10 years old.\nPrevention\nThe most important factor in preventing mushroom\npoisoning is to avoid eating wild or noncultivated mush-rooms. For anyone not expert in mushroom identification,there are generally no easily recognizable differences\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2268Mushroom poisoning\nA poisonous mushroom, Amanita muscaria (Photo\nResearchers.

    "title": "Music therapy",
    "content": "Music therapy\nDefinition\nMusic therapy is a technique of complementary med-\nicine that uses music prescribed in a skilled manner bytrained therapists. Programs are designed to help patientsovercome physical, emotional, intellectual, and socialchallenges. Applications range from improving the wellbeing of geriatric patients in nursing homes to loweringthe stress level and pain of women in labor. Music thera-\npy is used in many settings, including schools, rehabilita-\ntion centers, hospitals, hospice, nursing homes, commu-\nnity centers, and sometimes even in the home.\nPurpose\nMusic can be beneficial for anyone. Although it can\nbe used therapeutically for people who have physical,emotional, social, or cognitive deficits, even those whoare healthy can use music to relax, reduce stress, improvemood, or to accompany exercise . There are no potential-ly harmful or toxic effects. Music therapists help their\npatients achieve a number of goals through music,including improvement of communication, academicstrengths, attention span, and motor skills. They may alsoassist with behavioral therapy and pain management .\nPhysical effects\nBrain function physically changes in response to\nmusic. The rhythm can guide the body into breathing inslower, deeper patterns that have a calming effect. Heartrate and blood pressure are also responsive to the typesof music that are listened to. The speed of the heartbeattends to speed or slow depending on the volume andspeed of the auditory stimulus. Louder and faster noisestend to raise both heart rate and blood pressure; slower,softer, and more regular tones produce the oppositeresult. Music can also relieve muscle tension andimprove motor skills. It is often used to help rebuildphysical patterning skills in rehabilitation clinics. Levelsof endorphins, natural pain relievers, are increased whilelistening to music, and levels of stress hormones aredecreased. This latter effect may partially explain theability of music to improve immune function. A 1993study at Michigan State University showed that even 15minutes of exposure to music could increase interleukin-1 levels, a consequence which also heightens immunity.\nMental effects\nDepending on the type and style of sound, music can\neither sharpen mental acuity or assist in relaxation. Mem-ory and learning can be enhanced, and this is used withgood results in children with learning disabilities. Thiseffect may also be partially due to increased concentra-tion that many people have while listening to music. Bet-ter productivity is another outcome of an improved abilityto concentrate. The term “Mozart effect” was coined aftera study showed that college students performed better onmath problems when listening to classical music.\nEmotional effects\nThe ability of music to influence human emotion is\nwell known, and is used extensively by moviemakers. Avariety of musical moods may be used to create feelings ofcalmness, tension, excitement, or romance. Lullabies havelong been popular for soothing babies to sleep. Music canalso be used to express emotion nonverbally, which can bea very valuable therapeutic tool in some settings.\nDescription\nOrigins\nMusic has been used throughout human history to\nexpress and affect human emotion. In biblical accounts,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2269Music therapyKing Saul was reportedly soothed by David’s harp\nmusic, and the ancient Greeks expressed thoughts aboutmusic having healing effects as well. Many cultures aresteeped in musical traditions. It can change mood, havestimulant or sedative effects, and alter physiologicprocesses such as heart rate and breathing. The apparenthealth benefits of music to patients in Veterans Adminis-tration hospitals following World War II lead to it beingstudied and formalized as a complementary healing prac-tice. Musicians were hired to continue working in thehospitals. Degrees in music therapy became available inthe late 1940s, and in 1950, the first professional associa-tion of music therapists was formed in the United States.The National Association of Music Therapy merged withthe American Association of Music Therapy in 1998 tobecome the American Music Therapy Association.\nGoals\nMusic is used to form a relationship with the patient.\nThe music therapist sets goals on an individual basis,depending on the reasons for treatment, and selects spe-cific activities and exercises to help the patient progress.Objectives may include development of communication,cognitive, motor, emotional, and social skills. Some ofthe techniques used to achieve this are singing, listening,instrumental music, composition, creative movement,guided imagery , and other methods as appropriate.\nOther disciplines may be integrated as well, such asdance, art, and psychology. Patients may develop musi-cal abilities as a result of therapy, but this is not a majorconcern. The primary aim is to improve the patient’sability to function.\nTechniques\nLearning to play an instrument is an excellent\nmusical activity to develop motor skills in individualswith developmental delays, brain injuries, or othermotor impairment. It is also an exercise in impulse con-trol and group cooperation. Creative movement isanother activity that can help to improve coordination,as well as strength, balance, and gait. Improvisationfacilitates the nonverbal expression of emotion. Itencourages socialization and communication aboutfeelings as well. Singing develops articulation, rhythm,and breath control. Remembering lyrics and melody isan exercise in sequencing for stroke victims and others\nwho may be intellectually impaired. Composition ofwords and music is one avenue available to assist thepatient in working through fears and negative feelings.Listening is an excellent way to practice attending andremembering. It may also make the patient aware ofmemories and emotions that need to be acknowledgedand perhaps talked about. Singing and discussion is asimilar method, which is used with some patient popu-\nlations to encourage dialogue. Guided Imagery andMusic (GIM) is a very popular technique developed bymusic therapist Helen Bonny. Listening to music isused as a path to invoke emotions, picture, and symbolsfrom the patient. This is a bridge to the exploration andexpression of feelings.\nMusic and children\nThe sensory stimulation and playful nature of music\ncan help to develop a child’s ability to express emotion,communicate, and develop rhythmic movement. There isalso some evidence to show that speech and languageskills can be improved through the stimulation of bothhemispheres of the brain. Just as with adults, appropri-ately selected music can decrease stress, anxiety , and\npain. Music therapy in a hospital environment with thosewho are sick, preparing for surgery, or recovering post-operatively is appropriate and beneficial. Children canalso experience improved self-esteem through musicalactivities that allow them to succeed.\nNewborns may enjoy an even greater benefit of\nmusic. Those who are premature experience more rapidweight gain and hospital discharge than their peers whoare not exposed to music. There is also anecdotal evi-dence of improved cognitive function.\nMusic and rehabilitation\nPatients with brain damage from stroke, traumatic\nbrain injury, or other neurologic conditions have beenshown to exhibit significant improvement as a result ofmusic therapy. This is theorized to be partially the resultof entrainment, which is the synchronization of move-ment with the rhythm of the music. Consistent practiceleads to gains in motor skill ability and efficiency. Cogni-tive processes and language skills often benefit fromappropriate musical intervention.\nMusic and the elderly\nThe geriatric population can be particularly prone to\nanxiety and depression, particularly in nursing home res-idents. Chronic diseases causing pain are also notuncommon in this setting. Music is an excellent outlet toprovide enjoyment, relaxation, relief from pain, and anopportunity to socialize and reminisce about music thathas had special importance to the individual. It can havea striking effect on patients with Alzheimer’s disease ,\neven sometimes allowing them to focus and becomeresponsive for a time. Music has also been observed todecrease the agitation that is so common with this dis-ease. One study shows that elderly people who play a\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2270Music therapymusical instrument are more physically and emotionally\nfit as they age than their nonmusical peers are.\nMusic and the mentally ill\nMusic can be an effective tool for the mentally or\nemotionally ill. Autism is one disorder that has been par-\nticularly researched. Music therapy has enabled someautistic children to relate to others and have improvedlearning skills. Substance abuse, schizophrenia ,para-\nnoia, and disorders of personality, anxiety, and affect are\nall conditions that may be benefited by music therapy. Inthese groups, participation and social interaction are pro-moted through music. Reality orientation is improved.Patients are helped to develop coping skills, reducestress, and express their feelings.\nMusic and hospice\nPain, anxiety, and depression are major concerns\nwith patients who are terminally ill, whether they are inhospice or not. Music can provide some relief from pain,through release of endorphins and promotion of relax-ation. It can also provide an opportunity for the patient toreminisce and talk about the fears that are associatedwith death and dying. Music may help regulate the rapid\nbreathing of a patient who is anxious, and soothe themind. The Chalice of Repose project, headquartered atSt. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Montana, is one organi-zation that attends and nurtures dying patients throughthe use of music, in a practice they called music-thana-tology by developer Therese Schroeder-Sheker. Practi-tioners in this program work to relieve suffering throughmusic prescribed for the individual patient.\nMusic and labor\nResearch has proven that mothers require less pharma-\nceutical pain relief during labor if they make use of music.Using music that is familiar and associated with positiveimagery is the most helpful. During early labor, this willpromote relaxation. Maternal movement is helpful to getthe baby into a proper birthing position and dilate thecervix. Enjoying some “music to move by” can encouragethe mother to stay active for as long as possible duringlabor. The rhythmic auditory stimulation may also promptthe body to release endorphins, which are a natural form ofpain relief. Many women select different styles of musicfor each stage of labor, with a more intense, or faster piecefeeling like a natural accompaniment to the more difficultparts of labor. Instrumental music is often preferred.\nPrecautions\nPatients making use of music therapy should not dis-\ncontinue medications or therapies prescribed by otherhealth providers without prior consultation.KEY TERMS\nEntrainment —The patterning of body processes\nand movements to the rhythm of music\nPhysiologic —Characteristic of normal, healthy\nfunctioning\nResearch and general acceptance\nThere is little disagreement among physicians that\nmusic can be of some benefit for patients, although theextent to which it can have physical effects is not as wellacknowledged in the medical community.

    "content": "Mutism\nDefinition\nMutism is a rare childhood condition characterized\nby a consistent failure to speak in situations where talk-ing is expected. The child has the ability to converse nor-mally, and does so, for example, in the home, but consis-tently fails to speak in specific situations such as at\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2271Mutismschool or with strangers. It is estimated that one in every\n1,000 school-age children are affected.\nDescription\nExperts believe that this problem is associated with\nanxiety and fear in social situations such as in school or\nin the company of adults. It is therefore often considereda type of social phobia. This is not a communication dis-order because the affected children can converse normal-ly in some situations. It is not a developmental disorderbecause their ability to talk, when they choose to do so, isappropriate for their age level. This problem has beenlinked to anxiety, and one of the major ways in whichboth children and adults attempt to cope with anxiety isby avoiding whatever provokes the anxiety.\nAffected children are typically shy, and are especial-\nly so in the presence of strangers and unfamiliar sur-roundings or situations. However, the behaviors of chil-dren with this condition go beyond shyness.\nCauses and symptoms\nMutism is believed to arise from anxiety experienced\nin social situations where the child may be called upon tospeak. Refusing to speak, or speaking in a whisper, sparesthe child from the possible humiliation or embarrassmentof “saying the wrong thing.” When asked a direct ques-tion by teachers, for example, the affected child may actas if they are unable to answer.Some children may com-municate via gestures, nodding, or very brief utterances.Additional features may include excessive shyness, oppo-sitional behavior, and impaired learning at school.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of mutism is fairly easy to make\nbecause the signs amd symptoms are clear-cut and easilyobservable. However, other social disorders effectingsocial speech, such as autism or schizophrenia , must be\nconsidered in the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nThere are two recommended treatments for mutism:\nbehavior modification therapy and antidepressant med-KEY TERMS\nBehavior modification —A form of therapy that\nuses rewards to reinforce desired behavior.

It has been suggested that speech pathol-ogists may also be able to help these children.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for mutism is good. Sometimes it dis-\nappears suddenly on its own. The negative impact onlearning and school activities may, however, persist intoadult life.\nPrevention\nMutism cannot be prevented because the cause is not\nknown. However, family conflict or problems at schoolcontribute to the seriousness of the symptoms.\nResources\nBOOKS\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 4th ed.\nWashington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 1994.\nDonald G.

    "title": "Myasthenia gravis",
    "content": "Myasthenia gravis\nDefinition\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that\ncauses muscle weakness.\nDescription\nMyasthenia gravis (MG) affects the neuromuscular\njunction, interrupting the communication between nerveand muscle, and thereby causing weakness. A personwith MG may have difficulty moving their eyes, walking,speaking clearly, swallowing, and even breathing,depending on the severity and distribution of weakness.Increased weakness with exertion, and improvementwith rest, is a characteristic feature of MG.\nAbout 30,000 people in the United States are affect-\ned by MG. It can occur at any age, but is most commonin women who are in their late teens and early twenties,and in men in their sixties and seventies.\nCauses and symptoms\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, mean-\ning it is caused by the body’s own immune system. In\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2272Myasthenia gravisMG, the immune system attacks a receptor on the surface\nof muscle cells. This prevents the muscle from receivingthe nerve impulses that normally make it respond. MGaffects “voluntary” muscles, which are those musclesunder conscious control responsible for movement. Itdoes not affect heart muscle or the “smooth” musclefound in the digestive system and other internal organs.\nA muscle is stimulated to contract when the nerve\ncell controlling it releases acetylcholine molecules ontoits surface. The acetylcholine lands on a muscle proteincalled the acetylcholine receptor. This leads to rapidchemical changes in the muscle which cause it to con-tract. Acetylcholine is then broken down by acetyl-cholinesterase enzyme, to prevent further stimulation.\nIn MG, immune cells create antibodies against the\nacetylcholine receptor. Antibodies are proteins normallyinvolved in fighting infection. When these antibodiesattach to the receptor, they prevent it from receivingacetylcholine, decreasing the ability of the muscle torespond to stimulation.\nWhy the immune system creates these self-reactive\n“autoantibodies” is unknown, although there are severalhypotheses:\n• During fetal development, the immune system gener-\nates many B cells that can make autoantibodies, but Bcells that could harm the body’s own tissues arescreened out and destroyed before birth. It is possiblethat the stage is set for MG when some of these cellsescape detection.\n• Genes controlling other parts of the immune system,\ncalled MHC genes, appear to influence how susceptiblea person is to developing autoimmune disease.\n• Infection may trigger some cases of MG. When activat-\ned, the immune system may mistake portions of theacetylcholine receptor for portions of an invading virus,though no candidate virus has yet been identified con-clusively.\n• About 10% of those with MG also have thymomas, or\nbenign tumors of the thymus gland. The thymus is aprincipal organ of the immune system, and researchersspeculate that thymic irregularities are involved in theprogression of MG.\nSome or all of these factors (developmental, genetic,\ninfectious, and thymic) may interact to create the autoim-mune reaction.\nThe earliest symptoms of MG often result from\nweakness of the extraocular muscles, which control eyemovements. Symptoms involving the eye (ocular symp-toms) include double vision (diplopia), especially whennot gazing straight ahead, and difficulty raising the eye-lids ( ptosis ). A person with ptosis may need to tilt theirhead back to see. Eye-related symptoms remain the only\nsymptoms for about 15% of MG patients. Another com-mon early symptom is difficulty chewing and swallow-ing, due to weakness in the bulbar muscles, which are inthe mouth and throat. Choking becomes more likely,\nespecially with food that requires extensive chewing.\nWeakness usually becomes more widespread within\nseveral months of the first symptoms, reaching theirmaximum within a year in two-thirds of patients. Weak-ness may involve muscles of the arms, legs, neck, trunk,and face, and affect the ability to lift objects, walk, holdthe head up, and speak.\nSymptoms of MG become worse upon exertion, and\nbetter with rest. Heat, including heat from the sun, hotshowers, and hot drinks, may increase weakness. Infec-tion and stress may worsen symptoms. Symptoms may\nvary from day to day and month to month, with intervalsof no weakness interspersed with a progressive decline instrength.\n“Myasthenic crisis” may occur, in which the breathing\nmuscles become too weak to provide adequate respiration.Symptoms include weak and shallow breathing, shortness\nof breath , pale or bluish skin color, and a racing heart.\nMyasthenic crisis is an emergency condition requiringimmediate treatment. In patients treated with anti-cholinesterase agents, myasthenic crisis must be differenti-ated from cholinergic crisis related to overmedication.\nPregnancy worsens MG in about one third of\nwomen, has no effect in one third, and improves symp-toms in another third. About 12% of infants born towomen with MG have “neonatal myasthenia,” a tempo-rary but potentially life-threatening condition. It iscaused by the transfer of maternal antibodies into thefetal circulation just before birth. Symptoms includeweakness, floppiness, feeble cry, and difficulty feeding.The infant may have difficulty breathing, requiring theuse of a ventilator. Neonatal myasthenia usually clearsup within a month.\nDiagnosis\nMyasthenia gravis is often diagnosed accurately by a\ncareful medical history and a neuromuscular exam, butseveral tests are used to confirm the diagnosis. Other con-ditions causing worsening of bulbar and skeletal musclesmust be considered, including drug-induced myasthenia,thyroid disease, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome,botulism , and inherited muscular dystrophies.\nMG causes characteristic changes in the electrical\nresponses of muscles that may be observed with an elec-tromyogram, which measures muscular response to elec-trical stimulation. Repetitive nerve stimulation leads to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2273Myasthenia gravisreduction in the height of the measured muscle response,\nreflecting the muscle’s tendency to become fatigued.\nBlood tests may confirm the presence of the anti-\nbody to the acetylcholine receptor, though up to a quarterof MG patients will not have detectable levels. A chest x\nrayor chest computed tomography scan (CT scan) may\nbe performed to look for thymoma .\nTreatment\nWhile there is no cure for myasthenia gravis, there\nare a number of treatments that effectively control symp-toms in most people.\nEdrophonium (Tensilon) blocks the action of acetyl-\ncholinesterase, prolonging the effect of acetylcholine andincreasing strength. An injection of edrophonium rapidlyleads to a marked improvement in most people with MG.An alternate drug, neostigmine, may also be used.\nPyridostigmine (Mestinon) is usually the first drug\ntried. Like edrophonium, pyridostigmine blocks acetyl-cholinesterase. It is longer-acting, taken by mouth, andwell-tolerated. Loss of responsiveness and disease pro-gression combine to eventually make pyridostigmineineffective in tolerable doses in many patients.KEY TERMS\nAntibody —An immune protein normally used by\nthe body for combating infection and which ismade by B cells.\nAutoantibody —An antibody that reacts against\npart of the self.\nAutoimmune disease —A disease caused by a\nreaction of the body’s immune system.\nBulbar muscles —Muscles that control chewing,\nswallowing, and speaking.\nNeuromuscular junction —The site at which nerve\nimpulses are transmitted to muscles.\nPyridostigmine bromide (Mestinon) —An anti-\ncholinesterase drug used in treating myastheniagravis.\nTensilon test —A test for diagnosing myasthenia\ngravis.

Up to85% of people with MG improve after thymectomy, withcomplete remission eventually seen in about 30%. Theimprovement may take months or even several years tofully develop. Thymectomy is not usually recommendedfor children with MG, since the thymus continues to playan important immune role throughout childhood.\nImmune-suppressing drugs are used to treat MG if\nresponse to pyridostigmine and thymectomy are not ade-quate. Drugs include corticosteroids such as prednisone,\nand the non-steroids azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclo-sporine (Sandimmune).\nPlasma exchange may be performed to treat myas-\nthenic crisis or to improve very weak patients beforethymectomy. In this procedure, blood plasma is removedand replaced with purified plasma free of autoantibodies.It can produce a temporary improvement in symptoms,but is too expensive for long-term treatment. Anotherblood treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, isalso used for myasthenic crisis. In this procedure, largequantities of purified immune proteins (immunoglobu-lins) are injected. For unknown reasons, this leads tosymptomatic improvement in up to 85% of patients. It isalso too expensive for long-term treatment.\nPeople with weakness of the bulbar muscles may\nneed to eat softer foods that are easier to chew and swal-low. In more severe cases, it may be necessary to obtainnutrition through a feeding tube placed into the stomach\n(gastrostomy tube).\nPrognosis\nMost people with MG can be treated successfully\nenough to prevent their condition from becoming debili-tating.

    "title": "Mycetoma",
    "content": "Mycetoma\nDefinition\nMycetoma, or maduromycosis, is a slow-growing bac-\nterial or fungal infection focused in one area of the body,usually the foot. For this reason—and because the firstmedical reports were from doctors in Madura, India—analternate name for the disease is Madura foot. The infectionis characterized by an abnormal tissue mass beneath theskin, formation of cavities within the mass, and a fluid dis-charge. As the infection progresses, it affects the musclesand bones; at this advanced stage, disability may result.\nDescription\nAlthough the bacteria and fungi that cause myce-\ntoma are found in soil worldwide, the disease occursmainly in tropical areas in India, Africa, South America,Central America, and southeast Asia. Mycetoma is anuncommon disease, affecting an unknown number ofpeople annually.\nThere are more than 30 species of bacteria and fungi\nthat can cause mycetoma. Bacteria or fungi can be intro-duced into the body through a relatively minor skinwound. The disease advances slowly over months oryears, typically with minimal pain . When pain is experi-\nenced, it is usually due to secondary infections or boneinvolvement.Although it is rarely fatal, mycetoma causesdeformities and potential disability at its advanced stage.\nCauses and symptoms\nOwing to a wound, bacteria or fungi gain entry into\nthe skin. Approximately one month or more after theinjury, a nodule forms under the skin surface. The noduleis painless, even as it increases in size over the followingmonths. Eventually, the nodule forms a tumor, or mass ofabnormal tissue. The tumor contains cavities—calledsinuses—that discharge blood- or pus-tainted fluid. Thefluid also contains tiny grains, less than two thousandthsof an inch in size. The color of these grains depends onthe type of bacteria or fungi causing the infection.\nAs the infection continues, surrounding tissue\nbecomes involved, with an accumulation of scarring andloss of function. The infection can extend to the bone,causing inflammation, pain, and severe damage. Myce-toma may be complicated by secondary infections, inwhich new bacteria become established in the area andcause an additional set of problems.\nDiagnosis\nThe primary symptoms of a tumor, sinuses, and grain-\nflecked discharge often provide enough information todiagnose mycetoma. In the early stages, prior to sinus for-mation, diagnosis may be more difficult and a biopsy, ormicroscopic examination of the tissue, may be necessary. Ifbone involvement is suspected, the area is x-rayed to deter-mine the extent of the damage. The species of bacteria orfungi at the root of the infection is identified by staining thedischarge grains and inspecting them with a microscope.\nTreatment\nCombating mycetoma requires both surgery and\ndrug therapy. Surgery usually consists of removing thetumor and a portion of the surrounding tissue. If theinfection is extensive, amputation is sometimes neces-\nsary. Drug therapy is recommended in conjunction withsurgery. The specific prescription depends on the type ofbacteria or fungi causing the disease. Common medi-cines include antifungal drugs, such as ketoconazole andantibiotics (streptomycin sulfate, amikacin, sulfameth-\noxazole, penicillin, and rifampin).\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2275MycetomaPrognosis\nRecovery from mycetoma may take months or years,\nand the infection recurs after surgery in at least 20% ofcases. Drug therapy can reduce the chances of a re-estab-lished infection. The extent of deformity or disabilitydepends on the severity of infection; the more deeplyentrenched the infection, the greater the damage. Byitself, mycetoma is rarely fatal, but secondary infectionscan be fatal.\nPrevention\nMycetoma is a rare condition that is not contagious.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nFahal, A. H., and M. A.

These atypical mycobacter-\nial infections are a frequent complication in patients withhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or AIDS .\nDescription\nMycobacteria are a group of rod-shaped bacteria\nthat cause several diseases, among them leprosy and\ntuberculosis. For some time, scientists have known ofbacteria that are similar to Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\nthe cause of tuberculosis, but that grow and act different-ly. When tuberculosis was a much more widespreadproblem and microbiology was much less able to tell thedifference between similar microbes, these atypicalmycobacteria were ignored. Today, they have been clas-sified more precisely as members of the same speciesand called atypical (or nontuberculosis) mycobacteria.\nAlthough the medical profession has known about\nthese atypical infections for a long time, they were notconsidered a serious problem until the early 1980s. Itwas then that many of these atypical infections werenoticed among homosexuals and intravenous drug usersin New York City. These bacteria rarely cause infectionin humans other than those with HIV or AIDS.\nCauses and symptoms\nAlthough there are more than a dozen species of\natypical mycobacteria, the two most common areMycobacterium kansasii and M. avium-intracellulare .\nThese microbes are found in many places in the environ-ment: tap water, fresh and ocean water, milk, bird drop-pings, soil, and house dust. The manner in which thesebacteria are transmitted is not completely understood.There is no evidence that they are transmitted from per-son to person.\nM. avium-intracellulare (MAC or MAI) is a rare\ncause of lung disease in otherwise healthy humans but afrequent cause of infection among those whose resis-tance has been lowered by another disorder (opportunis-tic infection). According to some experts, MAC infectionis an almost inevitable complication of HIV . The infec-tion is caused by one of two similar organisms, M. avium\nand M. intracellulare .\nAIDS patients are almost always attacked by these\nmycobacteria. Once inside the body, the atypicalmycobacterial organisms colonize and grow in the lungslike tuberculosis. Because AIDS patients have a poorlyfunctioning immune system, the microbes multiplybecause they aren’t stopped by the body’s normal responseto infection. Once they have colonized the lungs, theorganisms enter the bloodstream and spread throughoutthe body, affecting almost every organ. These devastating\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2276Mycobacterial infections, atypicalinfections can invade the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, bone\nmarrow, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and brain.\nSymptoms include shortness of breath ,fever , night\nsweats, weight loss, appetite loss, fatigue , and progres-\nsively severe diarrhea , stomach pain ,nausea and vom-\niting . If the infection spreads to the brain, the patient\nmay experience weakness, headaches, vision problems,and loss of balance.\nMAC and M. kansasii sometimes cause lung infec-\ntions in middle-aged and elderly people with chronic lungconditions. MAC, M. kansasii , and M. scrofulaceum may\ncause inflammation of the lymph nodes in otherwisehealthy young children. M. fortuitum and M. chelonae\ncause skin and wound infections and abscesses after trau-ma or surgical procedures. M. marinum causes a nodular\ninflammation, usually on the arms and legs. This infectionis called “swimming pool granuloma” because it is associ-ated with swimming pools, fish tanks, and other bodies ofwater. M. ulcerans infection causes chronic skin ulcera-\ntions, usually on an arm or leg. Atypical mycobacteriainfections can also occur without causing any symptoms.In such cases, a tuberculin skin test may be positive.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is made from the patient’s symptoms\nand organisms grown in culture from the site of infec-tion. In cases of lung infection, a diagnostic workup willinclude a chest x ray and tests on discharges from the\nrespiratory passages (sputum).\nTreatment\nThese nontypical mycobacteria are not easy to treat\nin any patient and the problem is complicated when theperson has AIDS. Antibiotics aren’t particularly effec-\ntive, although rifabutin (a cousin of the anti-tuberculosisdrug rifampin) and clofazimine (an anti-leprosy drug)have helped some patients. It is also possible to containthe infection to some degree by combining differentdrugs, including ethionamide, cycloserine, ethambutol,and streptomycin.\nPrognosis\nBecause drug therapy is not easily effective, the\noverwhelming infections caused by these mycobacteriain AIDS patients can be fatal.\nPrevention\nPeople with HIV infection can prevent or delay the\nonset of MAC by taking disease-preventing drugs suchas rifabutin.KEY TERMS\nCulture —A test in which a sample of body fluid,\nsuch as prostatic fluid, is placed on materials spe-cially formulated to grow microorganisms.

Since these mycobacteria are found in most citywater systems, in hospital water supplies, and in bottledwater, at-risk persons should boil drinking water. Per-sons at risk should also avoid raw foods, especially sal-ads, root vegetables, and unpasteurized milk or cheese.Fruits and vegetables should be peeled and rinsed thor-oughly. Conventional cooking (baking, boiling orsteaming) destroys mycobacteria, which are killed at176°F (80°C).\nFinally, at-risk patients should avoid contact with\nanimals, especially birds and bird droppings.

(Unlike viruses, mycoplasma can reproduceoutside of living cells.) Many species within the genusMycoplasma thrive as parasites in human, bird, and ani-\nmal hosts. Some species can cause disease in humans.\nDescription\nMycoplasma are found most often on the surfaces of\nmucous membranes. They can cause chronic inflamma-tory diseases of the respiratory system, urogenital tract,and joints. The most common human illnesses caused bymycoplasma are due to infection with M. pneumoniae,\nwhich is responsible for 10-20% of all pneumonias. Thistype of pneumonia is also called atypical pneumonia,\nwalking pneumonia, or community-acquired pneumonia.Infection moves easily among people in close contactbecause it is spread primarily when infected droplets cir-culate in the air (that is, become aerosolized), usually dueto coughing, spitting, or sneezing.\nCauses and symptoms\nAtypical pneumonias can affect otherwise healthy\npeople who have close contact with one another. Pneu-monia caused by M.pneumoniae may start out with\nsymptoms of an upper respiratory infection, probably asore throat progressing to a dry cough within a few\ndays. Gradually, fever ,fatigue , muscle aches, and a\ncough that produces thin sputum (spit or phlegm) willemerge. Nonrespiratory symptoms may occur too:abdominal pain ,headache , and diarrhea ; about 20% of\npatients may have ear pain.\nAnother mycoplasma species, M. hominis , is com-\nmon in the mucous membranes of the genital area(including the cervix), and can cause infection in bothmales and females. Its presence doesn’t always result insymptoms.\nDiagnosis\nUsually, mycoplasma pneumonia will be identified\nafter other common diagnoses are set aside. For example,a type of antibiotic known as a beta-lactam might be pre-scribed for a respiratory infection producing fever andcough. If symptoms do not improve in 3-5 days, theorganism causing the disease is not a typical one and notsusceptible to these antibiotics . If a Gram’s stain (a com-\nmon test done on sputum) does not indicate a gram-posi-tive pathogen, the doctor will suspect a gram-negativeorganism, such as mycoplasma. The actual underlyingorganism may not be identified (it isn’t in almost 50% ofcases of atypical pneumonia). Although it is rare, a rashmay appear along with pneumonia symptoms.Thisshould trigger suspicion of mycoplasma pneumonia,even if laboratory tests are inconclusive.\nStandard x rays may reveal a patchy material that\nhas entered the tissue; this can be evident for months.Laboratory tests include cold agglutinins, complementfixation, culture, and enzyme immunoassay. The pres-ence of infection with M. pneumoniae would be indicat-\ned by a fourfold rise in M. pneumoniae -specific antibody\nin serum, during the illness or convalescence. Highlysophisticated and specific polymerase chain reactionmethods (PCR) have been developed for many respirato-ry pathogens, including M. pneumoniae . They are not\nreadily available and are very expensive.\nTreatment\nA 2-3 week course of certain antibiotics (ery-\nthromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin,or doxycycline) is generally prescribed for atypical pneu-monia. This disease is infectious for weeks, even afterthe patient starts antibiotics. A persistent cough maylinger for 6 weeks.\nPrognosis\nMycoplasma pneumonia may be involved in the\nonset of asthma in adults; other rare complications\ninclude meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome ,\nmononeuritis multiplex, myocarditis , or pericarditis .\nThis may increase the risk of acute arrhythmias leading\nto sudden cardiac death . However, with proper treat-\nment and rest, recovery should be complete.\nPrevention\nAt this time, there are no vaccines for mycoplasma\ninfection. It is difficult to control its spread, especially in agroup setting. The best measures are still the simplestones. Avoid exposure to people with respiratory infectionswhenever possible. A person who has a respiratory infec-tion should cover the face while coughing or sneezing.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2278Mycoplasma infectionsResources\nBOOKS\nCassell, Gail H., Gregory G.

    "content": "Myelodysplastic syndrome\nDefinition\nMyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a disease that\nis associated with decreased production of blood cells.Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, and theblood cells of people with MDS do not mature normally.There are three major types of blood cells —red bloodcells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients with MDScan have decreased production of one, two, or all threetypes of blood cells.\nDescription\nBlood cells are used in the body for many different\nand important functions, such as carrying oxygen (redblood cells), fighting infection (white blood cells), andcontrolling bleeding (platelets). Blood cells are formedand stored in the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissueinside large bones. Stem cells, or immature blood cells,are stored in the bone marrow and have the ability todevelop into all three types of mature blood cells. Whenthe body needs a specific type of blood cell, the bone mar-row uses its stockpile of stem cells to produce the kind ofmature cells needed for that particular situation.\nIn patients who have MDS, blood cells fail to mature\nnormally. In other words, the bone marrow is unable todevelop a normal amount of mature blood cells, and isalso not able to increase blood cell production whenmature cells are needed. Sometimes, even the cells thatare produced do not function normally. The marrow even-tually becomes filled with the immature cells and there isnot room for the normal cells to grow and develop. MDStherefore causes a shortage of functional blood cells.\nSubtypes of MDS\nMDS is divided into five different subtypes that are\nclassified according to the number and appearance ofblast cells in the bone marrow. It is important for doctorsto know the type of MDS a patient has, because each sub-type affects patients differently and requires specific treat-ment. The International Prognostic Scoring System(IPSS) can help the doctor to determine the best treatmentfor an individual patient. The subtypes are as follows:\n• Refractory anemia (RA). Bone marrow with less than\n5% blast cells and abnormal red blood cell blasts\n• Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS).\nBone marrow with less than 5% blasts and characteris-tic abnormalities in red blood cells\n• Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB). Bone\nmarrow with 5-20% blast cells, and higher risk ofchanging into acute leukemia over time\n• Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation\n(RAEBT). Bone marrow with 21-30% blast cells. Thisform is most likely to change into acute leukemia.\n• Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Marrow\nwith 5-20% blasts and excess monocytes (a specifictype of white blood cell).\nApproximately 15,000 new cases are diagnosed\nannually in the United States. The average age at diagno-sis is 70. The most common types are RA and RARS. Itis rare to have MDS before age 50. MDS is slightly morecommon in males than in females.\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nThere is no clear cause for the majority of MDS\ncases, which is referred to as primary or de novo\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. In some cases, however,MDS results from earlier cancer treatments such as\nradiation and/or chemotherapy . This type of MDS is\ncalled secondary or treatment related MDS, is often seen3 to 7 years after the exposure, and usually occurs inyounger people.\nOther possible causative agents for MDS include\nexposure to radiation, cigarette smoke or toxic chemi-cals such as benzene. Children with pre-existing chro-mosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome have\na higher risk of developing MDS. MDS does notappear to run in families, nor can it be spread to otherindividuals.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2279Myelodysplastic syndromeSymptoms\nMDS symptoms are related to the type of blood cells\nthat the body is lacking. The earliest symptoms are usu-ally due to anemia, which results from a shortage ofmature red blood cells. Anemia causes patients to feeltired and out of breath because there is a lack of cellstransporting oxygen throughout the body. MDS may alsolead to a shortage of white blood cells resulting in anincreased likelihood of infections. Another symptom ofMDS is increased bleeding (e.g. blood in stool, nosebleeds, increased bruises or bleeding gums) which is due\nto a low level of platelets. These symptoms can occur inany combination, depending on a given patient’s specificsubtype of MDS.\nDiagnosis\nBlood tests\nPeople who have MDS usually visit their primary\ncare doctor first, with symptoms of fatigue , and are then\nreferred to a hematologist (a physician who specializes indiseases of the blood). The diagnosis of MDS requires acomplete analysis of the patient’s blood and bone mar-row, which is done by the hematologist. A completeblood count (CBC) is done to determine the number of\neach blood cell type within the sample. Low numbers ofred blood cells, white blood cells, and or platelets aresigns that a patient has MDS. Numerous other medicalproblems such as bleeding, nutritional deficiencies, oradverse reaction to a medication can also cause lowblood counts. The hematologist will investigate othercauses for low blood counts before assigning a diagnosisof MDS. Blood cells in patients with MDS can also beabnormal when viewed under the microscope.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\nA bone marrow biopsy is required to confirm the\ndiagnosis of MDS and determine the correct MDS sub-type. This procedure involves a needle used to take asample of marrow from inside the bone. The area of theskin where the needle is inserted is numbed and some-times the patient is also sedated. Patients may experiencesome discomfort but the procedure is safe and is overfairly quickly. Marrow samples are usually taken fromthe back of the hip bone (iliac crest). A sample of themarrow, known as an aspirate, and a small piece of boneare both removed with the needle.\nA hematologist or a pathologist (a specialist in diag-\nnosing diseases through cell examination) will carefullyexamine the bone marrow sample through a microscope.Microscopic examination allows the doctor to determinethe number and type of blast cells (immature cells) with-in the marrow in order to identify the MDS subtype.\nCells from the bone marrow are also sent for cytogenetictesting, which analyzes the cells’ chromosomes. Forty toseventy percent of MDS patients have abnormal bonemarrow chromosomes as a result of the disease. The pat-tern of these abnormalities can be used to predict how apatient will respond to a particular treatment. Thus, thefull set of information provided by a bone marrow biopsyand CBC will ultimately allow the doctor to recommendthe most effective treatment plan.\nInternational Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)\nfor MDS\nOnce a diagnosis of MDS is established, the doctor\nwill calculate the IPSS score for each individual patient.The bone marrow blast percentage, chromosomal abnor-malities and number of different blood types that arereduced determine the score. A score of 0 to 3.5 isassigned to each patient. Patients with lower score have abetter prognosis and usually should not undertake treat-ment upon initial diagnosis. Patients with a higher scorehave more aggressive disease and should consider moreaggressive treatment.\nTreatments\nSupportive care\nTreatment for MDS is tailored to the patient’s age,\ngeneral health, specific MDS subtype, and IPSS score.Treatment varies for each patient, but most treatmentstrategies are designed to control the symptoms of MDS.This approach is called supportive care and aims toimprove the patient’s quality of life.\nSupportive care for MDS patients commonly includes\nred blood cell transfusions to relieve symptoms related toanemia. Red cell transfusions are relatively safe and thephysician will review risks and benefits with thisapproach. Transfusions of any type only last a certainamount of time and therefore need to be repeated at certainintervals. Platelet transfusions can also be a way to controlexcessive bleeding. The doctor will decide with each indi-vidual patient when it is appropriate to give a transfusion .\nAntibiotics are used when needed to combat infections\nthat can occur more frequently in patients with low whiteblood cell counts.\nBone marrow transplantation\nBone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a type of\ntreatment that attempts to provide MDS patients with acure. This strategy requires the patient to be in fairlygood health and is therefore more likely to be used inyounger patients. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT)\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2280Myelodysplastic syndromehas been found to be a successful treatment for MDS\npatients under the age of 50 (and some over 50 in goodhealth). Following BMT, many patients are able toachieve long-term, disease-free survival. Unfortunately,most MDS patients cannot receive a traditional bonemarrow transplant because of older age or because theydo not have a suitable donor. Bone marrow donors areusually siblings or are obtained from the national bonemarrow registry. “Mini”-bone marrow transplants useless intense chemotherapy, and are currently being testedin older patients who would otherwise not be candidatesfor traditional bone marrow transplants.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy has been used to treat some MDS\npatients; however, the disease often recurs after a periodof time. This type of therapy uses cell-killing drugs thatmay also damage healthy cells in the body. Mostchemotherapy drugs are associated with some sideeffects. For these reasons, chemotherapy is generally notused until the MDS becomes more aggressive or thepatient has a high IPSS score.\nGrowth factors\nGrowth factors are natural proteins that the body\nnormally uses to control blood production. These sub-stances stimulate the patient’s bone marrow to producehealthy blood cells. Growth factors that stimulate whitecell production are G-CSF (also called neupogen or fil-grastim) and GMCSF (Leukine, sargramostim). In orderto increase red cell production another growth factor,erythropoietin (Procrit) is used. These growth factors aresafe with few side effects and are available only in theinjectable form. The physician will decide if this treat-ment is appropriate for an individual patient.\nAlternative treatment\nThere are no alternative therapies that have been\nproven to successfully treat MDS. Some of the availablealternative drugs can have adverse side effects and there-fore a physician should be informed if they are being used.\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis for MDS patients depends on the sub-\ntype of their disease and the IPSS score. Patients withRA, RARS or low IPSS score rarely develop leukemiaand may live with disease for some years. The higher-risk patients including those with RAEB, RAEBt,CMMoL or high IPSS scores progress more rapidly, andrequire intensive therapy to control the disease.\nManaging MDS requires frequent doctor appoint-\nments to monitor disease progression and to evaluate theresponse to treatment. Fortunately for many patients,\nrecent advances in therapy have significantly enhancedtheir ability to cope with MDS. Experimental drugs and abetter understanding of the disease are likely to improvethe overall prognosis in the future.\nPrevention\nMDS is usually impossible to prevent. Being careful\nabout daily activities and avoiding the use of aspirin-likeproducts that thin the blood may prevent secondary com-plications of MDS such as bruising and bleeding. Prac-ticing good hygiene and avoiding crowds or people withinfections can sometimes prevent infections. A well bal-anced diet is recommended to increase overall energy.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAguayo, Alvaro, Jorge Cortes, and Hagop Kantarjian. “Myelo-\ndysplastic Syndromes,” In Cancer Management: A Mulit-\ndisciplinary Approach, Fourth Edition, edited by Richard\nPazdur, et al.

    "title": "Myelofibrosis",
    "content": "Myelofibrosis\nDefinition\nMyelofibrosis is a rare disease of the bone marrow in\nwhich collagen builds up fibrous scar tissue inside the mar-row cavity. This is caused by the uncontrolled growth of ablood cell precursor, which results in the accumulation ofscar tissue in bone marrow. Myelofibrosis goes by manynames including idiopathic myelofibrosis, agnogenicmyeloid metaplasia, chronic myelosclerosis, aleukemicmegakaryocytic myelosis, and leukoerythroblastosis.\nDescription\nMyelofibrosis can be associated with many other\nconditions including breast cancer ,prostate cancer ,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2281MyelofibrosisHodgkin’s disease , non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, acute\nmyeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, hairy\ncell leukemia ,multiple myeloma , myeloproliferative\ndiseases, tuberculosis , Gaucher’s disease, and Paget’s\ndisease of bone . Myelofibrosis typically becomes pro-\ngressively worse and can cause death .\nIn myelofibrosis, abnormal cells (hematopoietic stem\ncells) grow out of control and begin to produce bothimmature blood cells and excess scar (fibrous) tissue. Thefibrous tissue builds up (fibrosis) primarily in the bonemarrow, the place where blood cells are produced. Thefibrous tissue interferes with the production of normalblood cells. The outcome of this is that the blood made bythe bone marrow is of poor quality. To compensate forthis, blood cell production occurs in other parts of thebody (extramedullary hematopoiesis), but most notably inthe spleen and liver. This causes enlargement of thespleen (splenomegaly) and the liver (hepatomegaly).Extramedullary hematopoiesis is not effective and, com-bined with the reduced production of blood cells by thebone marrow, a condition called anemia results.\nThe abnormal stem cells can spread throughout the\nbody, settle in other organs, and form tumors that pro-duce more abnormal blood cells and fibrous tissue. Thesetumors are most commonly found in the adrenals, kid-neys, lymph nodes, breast, lungs, skin, bowel, thymus,thyroid, prostate, and urinary tract.\nMost patients with myelofibrosis are over 50 years\nold; the average age at diagnosis is 65 years. However,myelofibrosis can occur at any age. Myelofibrosis occurswith equal frequency in women and men, but in childrenit affects girls twice as often as it does boys.\nCauses and symptoms\nMyelofibrosis is caused by an abnormality in a sin-\ngle stem cell, which causes it to grow out of control.Myelofibrosis tumors that have originated from a singlecell are called monoclonal. The cause of the stem cellabnormality is unknown. Persons who were exposed tobenzene or high doses of radiation have developedmyelofibrosis. There may be an association betweenmyelofibrosis and autoimmune diseases, such as sys-\ntemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma , in which\nthe immune system treats certain molecules of the bodyas foreign invaders.\nSymptoms usually appear slowly over a long period\nof time. About one quarter of all patients with myelofi-brosis have no symptoms (asymptomatic). An enlargedspleen discovered at an annual medical examination maybe the first clue. Symptoms of myelofibrosis include:\n• fatigue• weight loss\n• paleness•f e v e r• sweating• weakness• heart palpitations\n• shortness of breath\n• itchiness\n• feeling full after eating a small amount of food• stomach pain or discomfort\n• pain in the left shoulder or upper left portion of the\nbody\n• unexpected bleeding• bone pain, especially in the legs\nDiagnosis\nBecause symptoms are similar to other diseases\n(mostly leukemias), myelofibrosis is not easy to diag-nose. The doctor would use his or her hands to feel (pal-pate) for enlargement of the spleen and liver. Blood testsand urine tests would be performed. Bone marrow aspi-\nration and biopsy can help make a diagnosis, but they\noften fail because of the fibrosis. X-ray imaging andmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed.\nTreatment\nMany asymptomatic patients, if stable, do not\nrequire treatment. There is no cure for myelofibrosis,although bone marrow transplantation is curative in\nsome cases. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptomsand improving quality of life.\nMedications\nMale hormones (androgens) can be used to treat\nanemia but, in women, these drugs can cause the devel-opment of male characteristics (e.g., hair growth on theface and body). Glucocorticoid therapy is also an effec-tive treatment of anemia and can improve myelofibrosisin children. Nutrients that stimulate blood formation(hematinics), such as iron, folic acid , and vitamin B\n12,\nmay reduce anemia. Cancer chemotherapy (usually\nhydroxyurea) can decrease splenomegaly and hepato-megaly, reduce symptoms of myelofibrosis, lessen ane-mia, and sometimes reduce bone marrow fibrosis. Thebone marrow of myelofibrosis patients is often not strongenough to withstand the harsh chemotherapy drugs, sothis treatment is not always an option. Interferon-alphahas been shown to reduce spleen size, reduce bone pain,\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2282Myelofibrosisand, in some cases, increase the number of blood\nplatelets (structures involved in blood clotting).\nOther treatments\nIn certain cases, the enlarged spleen may be\nremoved ( splenectomy ). Conditions that warrant\nsplenectomy include spleen pain, the need for frequentblood transfusion , very low levels of platelets ( throm-\nbocytopenia ), and extreme pressure in the blood vessels\nof the liver (portal hypertension ).\nRadiation therapy is used to treat splenomegaly,\nspleen pain, bone pain, tumors in certain places such asnext to the spinal cord, and fluid accumulation inside theabdomen ( ascites ). Patients who are not strong enough\nto undergo splenectomy are often treated with radiationtherapy.\nBone marrow transplantation may be used to treat\nsome patients with myelofibrosis. This procedure may beperformed on patients who are less than 50 years old,have a poor life expectancy, and have a brother or sisterwith blood-type similarities.\nPatients with severe anemia may require blood\ntransfusions.\nPrognosis\nSimilar to leukemias, myelofibrosis is progressive\nand often requires therapy to control the disease. Myelofi-brosis can progress to acute lymphocytic leukemia orlymphoma. Although a number of factors to predict thesurvival time have been proposed, advanced age or severeanemia are consistently associated with a poor prognosis.The average survival rate of patients diagnosed withmyelofibrosis is five years. Death is usually caused byinfection, bleeding, complications of splenectomy, heart\nfailure , or progression to leukemia. Spontaneous remis-\nsion is rare.\nPrevention\nPersons who have been exposed to radiation, ben-\nzene, or radioactive thorium dioxide (a chemical usedduring certain diagnostic radiological procedures) are atrisk for myelofibrosis.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLichtman, Marshall. “Idiopathic Myelofibrosis (Agnogenic\nMyeloid Metaplasia).” In Williams Hematology , edited by\nErnest Beutler et al.

    "title": "Myelography",
    "content": "Myelography\nDefinition\nMyelography is an x-ray examination of the spinal\ncanal. A contrast agent is injected through a needle intothe space around the spinal cord to display the spinalcord, spinal canal, and nerve roots on an x ray.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a myelogram is to evaluate the spinal\ncord and/or nerve roots for suspected compression. Pres-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2283Myelographysure on these delicate structures causes pain or other\nsymptoms. A myelogram is performed when precisedetail about the spinal cord is needed to make a definitivediagnosis. In most cases, myelography is used after otherstudies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a\ncomputed tomography scan (CT scan), have not yieldedenough information to be sure of the disease process.Sometimes myelography followed by CT scan is an alter-native for patients who cannot have an MRI scan, becausethey have a pacemaker or other implanted metallic device.\nA herniated or ruptured intervertebral disc, popular-\nly known as a slipped disc, is one of the most commoncauses for pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots.Discs are pads of fiber and cartilage that contain rubberytissue. They lie between the vertebrae, or individualbones, which make up the spine. Discs act as cushions,accommodating strains, shocks, and position changes. Adisc may rupture suddenly, due to injury, or a suddenstraining with the spine in an unnatural position. In othercases, the problem may come on gradually as a result ofprogressive deterioration of the discs with aging . The\nlower back is the most common area for this problem,but it sometimes occurs in the neck, and rarely in theupper back. A myelogram can help accurately locate thedisc or discs involved.\nMyelography may be used when a tumor is suspect-\ned. Tumors can originate in the spinal cord, or in tissuessurrounding the cord. Cancers that have started in otherparts of the body may spread or metastasize in the spine.It is important to precisely locate the mass causing pres-sure, so effective treatment can be undertaken. Patientswith known cancer who develop back pain may require a\nmyelogram for evaluation.\nOther conditions that may be diagnosed using myel-\nography include arthritic bony growths, known as spurs,narrowing of the spinal canal, called spinal stenosis ,o r\nmalformations of the spine.\nPrecautions\nPatients who are unable to lie still or cooperate with\npositioning should not have this examination. Severecongenital spinal abnormalities may make the examina-tion technically difficult to carry out. Patients with a his-tory of severe allergic reaction to contrast material (x-raydye) should report this to their physician. Pretreatmentwith medications to minimize the risk of severe reactionmay be recommended.\nDescription\nMyelograms can be performed in a hospital x-ray\ndepartment or in an outpatient radiology facility. Thepatient lies on the x-ray table on his or her stomach. The\nradiologist first looks at the spine under fluoroscopy,where the images appear on a monitor screen. This isdone to find the best location to position the needle. Theskin is cleaned, then numbed with local anesthetic. Theneedle is inserted. Occasionally, a small amount of cere-brospinal fluid, the clear fluid that surrounds the spinalcord and brain, may be withdrawn through the needleand sent for laboratory studies. Then contrast material isinjected. The contrast material (dye) is a liquid thatshows up on x rays.\nThe x-ray table is tilted slowly. This allows the con-\ntrast material to reach different levels in the spinal canal.The flow is observed under fluoroscopy, then x rays aretaken with the table tilted at various angles. A footrestand shoulder straps or supports will keep the patient fromsliding.\nIn many instances, a CT scan of the spine will be\nperformed immediately after a myelogram, while thecontrast material is still in the spinal canal. This helpsoutline internal structures most clearly.\nA myelogram takes approximately 30-60 minutes. A\nCT scan adds about another hour to the examination. Ifthe procedure is done as an outpatient exam, some facili-ties prefer the patient to stay in a recovery area for up tofour hours.\nPreparation\nPatients should be well hydrated at the time of a\nmyelogram. Increasing fluids the day before the study isusually recommended. All food and fluid intake should bestopped approximately four hours before the myelogram.\nCertain medications may need to be stopped for one\nto two days before myelography is performed. Theseinclude some antipsychotics, antidepressants, blood thin-ners, and diabetic medications. Patients should consultwith their physician and/or the facility where the study isto be done.\nPatients who smoke may be asked to stop the day\nbefore the test. This helps decrease the chance of nauseaor headaches after the myelogram. Immediately beforethe examination, patients should empty their bowels andbladder.\nAftercare\nAfter the examination is completed, the patient usu-\nally rests for several hours, with the head elevated. Extrafluids are encouraged, to help eliminate the contrastmaterial and prevent headaches. A regular diet and rou-tine medications may be resumed. Strenuous physical\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2284Myelographyactivities, especially any which involve bending over,\nmay be discouraged for one or two days. The doctorshould be notified if a fever , excessive nausea and vom-\niting , severe headache , or stiff neck develop.\nRisks\nHeadache is a common complication of myelogra-\nphy. It may begin several hours to several days after theexamination. The cause is thought to be changes in cere-brospinal fluid pressure, not a reaction to the dye. Theheadache may be mild and easily alleviated with rest andincreased fluids. Sometimes, nonprescription medicinesare recommended. In some instances, the headache maybe more severe and require stronger medication or othermeasures for relief. Many factors influence whether thepatient develops this problem. These include the type ofneedle used and the age and sex of the patient. Patientswith a history of chronic or recurrent headache are morelikely to develop a headache after a myelogram.\nThe chance of reaction to the contrast material is a\nvery small, but potentially significant risk with myelogra-phy. It is estimated that only 5-10% of patients experienceany effect from contrast exposure. The vast majority ofreactions are mild, such as sneezing, nausea, or anxiety .\nThese usually resolve by themselves. A moderate reac-tion, like wheezing or hives , may be treated with medica-\ntion, but is not considered life threatening. Severe reac-tions, such as heart or respiratory failure , happen very\ninfrequently. These require emergency medical treatment.\nRare complications of myelography include injury\nto the nerve roots from the needle, or from bleeding intothe spaces around the roots. Inflammation of the delicatecovering of the spinal cord, called arachnoiditis, or infec-tions, can also occur. Seizures are another very uncom-mon complication reported after myelography.\nNormal results\nA normal myelogram would show a spinal canal of\nnormal width, with no areas of constriction or obstruction.\nAbnormal results\nA myelogram may reveal a herniated disk , tumor,\nbone spurs, or narrowing of the spinal canal (spinalstenosis).\nResources\nBOOKS\nDaffner, Richard.

    "content": "Myers-Briggs type indicator\nDefinition\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a widely-\nused personality inventory, or test, employed in vocational,educational, and psychotherapy settings to evaluate person-ality type in adolescents and adults age 14 and older.\nPurpose\nIn an educational setting, the MBTI may be per-\nformed to assess student learning style. Career counselorsuse the test to help others determine what occupationalfield they might be best suited for, and it is also used inorganizational settings to assess management skills andfacilitate teamwork and problem solving. Because theMBTI is also a tool for self-discovery, mental health pro-fessionals may administer the test in counseling sessionsto provide their patients with insight into their behavior.\nPrecautions\nThe MBTI should only be administered, scored, and\ninterpreted by a professional trained in its use. Culturaland language differences in the test subject may affectperformance and may result in inaccurate test results.The test administrator should be informed before testingbegins if the test taker is not fluent in English and/or hehas a unique cultural background.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2285Myers-Briggs type indicatorDescription\nIn 2000, an estimated two million people took the\nMBTI, making it the most frequently used personalityinventory available. The test was first introduced in 1942,the work of mother and daughter Katharine C. MyersBriggs and Isabel Briggs. There are now several differentversions of the test available. Form M, which contains 93items, is the most commonly used.\nThe Myers-Briggs inventory is based on Carl Jung’s\ntheory of types, outlined in his 1921 work Psychological\nTypes . Jung’s theory holds that human beings are either\nintroverts or extraverts , and their behavior follows from\nthese inborn psychological types. He also believed thatpeople take in and process information different ways,based on their personality traits.\nThe Myers-Briggs evaluates personality type and\npreference based on the four Jungian psychological types:\n• extraversion (E) or introversion (I)\n• sensing (S) or intuition (N)\n• thinking (T) or feeling (F)• judging (J) or perceiving (P)\nPreparation\nPrior to the administration of the MBTI, the test sub-\nject should be fully informed about the nature of the testand its intended use. He or she should also receive stan-dardized instructions for taking the test and any informa-tion on the confidentiality of the results.\nNormal results\nMyers-Briggs results are reported as a four-letter\npersonality type (e.g., ESTP, ISFJ). Each letter corre-sponds to an individual’s preference in each of the fourpairs of personality indicators (i.e., E or I, S or N, T or F,and J or P). There are a total of sixteen possible combina-tions of personality types on the MBTI.\nLetter One: E or I\nExtraverts focus more on people and things, intro-\nverts on ideas.KEY TERMS\nMulti-tasking —Performing multiple duties or tak-\ning on multiple responsibilities and roles simulta-neously.\nVocational —Relating to an occupation, career, or\njob.Letter Two: S or N\nSensing dominant personalities prefer to perceive\nthings through sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell,while intuition dominant types look to past experienceand are more abstract in their thinking.\nLetter Three: T or F\nThe third subtype is a measure of how people use\njudgement. Thinking types use logic to judge the world,while feeling types tend to view things on the basis ofwhat emotions they invoke.\nLetter Four: J or P\nEveryone judges and perceives, but those who are\njudging dominant are said to be more methodical andresults-oriented, while perceiving dominant personalitiesare good at multi-tasking and are flexible.\nResources\nBOOKS\nQuenck, Naomi.

    "content": "Myocardial resection\nDefinition\nMyocardial resection is a surgical procedure in\nwhich a portion of the heart muscle is removed.\nPurpose\nMyocardial resection is done to improve the stability\nof the heart function or rhythm. Also known as endocar-dial resection, this open-heart surgery is done to destroyor remove damaged areas of the heart that cause life-threatening heart rhythms.

    "title": "Myocarditis",
    "content": "Myocarditis\nDefinition\nMyocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart\nmuscle (myocardium) that can result from a variety of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2288Myocarditiscauses. While most cases are produced by a viral infec-\ntion, an inflammation of the heart muscle may also beinstigated by toxins, drugs, and hypersensitive immunereactions. Myocarditis is a rare but serious condition thataffects both males and females of any age.\nDescription\nMost cases of myocarditis in the United States origi-\nnate from a virus, and the disease may remain undiag-nosed by doctors due to its general lack of initial symp-toms. The disease may also present itself as an acute, cat-astrophic illness that requires immediate treatment.Although the inflammation or degeneration of the heartmuscle that myocarditis causes may be fatal, this diseaseoften goes undetected. It may also disguise itself asischemic, valvular, or hypertensive heart disease.\nAn inflammation of the heart muscle may occur as\nan isolated disorder or be the dominating feature of a sys-temic disease (one that affects the whole body, like sys-\ntemic lupus erythematosus ).\nCauses and symptoms\nWhile there are several contributing factors that may\nlead to myocarditis, the primary cause is viral. Myocardi-tis usually results from the Coxsackie B virus, and mayalso result from measles ,influenza , chicken pox, hepati-\ntis virus, or the adenovirus in children. If an acute onsetof severe myocarditis occurs, a patient may display thefollowing symptoms:\n• rhythm disturbances of the heart• rapid heartbeat ( Ventricular tachycardia )\n• left or right ventricular enlargement•shortness of breath (Dyspnea)\n• pulmonary edema (the accumulation of fluid in the\nlungs due to left-sided heart failure )\n• swollen legs\nAdditional causes of myocarditis include:\n• bacterial infections, such as tetanus ,gonorrhea ,o r\ntuberculosis\n• parasite infections, such as Chagas’ disease (which is\ncaused by an insect-borne protozoan most commonlyseen in Central and South America)\n• rheumatic fever\n• surgery on the heart• radiation therapy for cancer that is localized in the\nchest, such as breast or lung cancer\n• certain medicationsAs of 1996, research has shown that illegal drugs\nand toxic substances may also produce acute or chronicinjury to the myocardium. These studies also indicate anincrease in the incidence of toxic results from the use ofcocaine . This illegal drug causes coronary artery spasm,\nmyocardial infarction ( heart attack ), and arrhythmias ,\nas well as myocarditis.\nFurther studies conducted in 1996 indicate that mal-\nnutrition encourages the Coxsackie B virus to flourish,\nleading to the potential development of myocarditis.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is also now rec-\nognized as a cause of myocarditis, though its prevalenceis not known.\nSymptoms of myocarditis may start as fatigue , short-\nness of breath, fever and aching of the joints, all character-istic of a flu-like illness. In contrast to this type of mildappearance, myocarditis may also appear suddenly in theform of heart failure, or sudden cardiac death without any\nprior symptoms. If an inflammation of the heart muscleleads to congestive heart failure, symptoms such as swollenfeet and ankles, distended neck veins, a rapid heartbeat, anddifficulty breathing while reclining may all appear.\nDiagnosis\nThe best way to diagnose myocarditis may be through\na person’s observation of his or her own symptoms, fol-lowed by a thorough medical history and physical examconducted by a doctor. Further tests usually include labo-ratory blood studies and echocardiography . An electro-\ncardiogram (ECG) is also routinely used due to its abilityto detect a mild case of the disease. Cardiac catheteriza-\ntion and angiography are additional diagnostic tests used\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2289Myocarditis\nThis illustration depicts the inflammation of the myocarditis,\nthe middle muscular layer of the heart wall. (Custom Medical\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)to determine the presence of myocarditis, or to rule out\nother possible heart diseases that may lead to heart failure.\nAnother measure used to diagnosis myocarditis is\nthe endomyocardial biopsy procedure. This invasivecatheterization procedure examines a biopsied, or“snipped,” piece of the endocardium (the lining mem-brane of the inner surface of the heart). The tissue sampleis examined to verify the presence of the disease, as wellas to try to determine the infective cause. An approachused only with a patient’s consent, this procedure mayalso confirm acute myocarditis, allowing close monitor-ing of potential congestive heart failure.\nTreatment\nWhile myocarditis is a serious condition, there is no\nmedical treatment necessary if it results from a generalviral infection. The only steps to recovery include rest andavoidance of physical exertion. Adequate rest becomesmore important to recovery if the case is severe myocardi-tis with signs of dilated cardiomyopathy (disease of theheart muscles). In this case, medical treatment for conges-tive heart failure may include the following medications:angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuret-\nicsto reduce fluid retention, digitalis to stimulate a\nstronger heartbeat, and low-dose beta-blockers.\nIf myocarditis is caused by a bacterial infection, the\ndisease is treated with antibiotics to fight the infection.KEY TERMS\nAdenovirus —One type of virus that can cause\nupper respiratory tract infections.\nAngiography —A procedure which uses x ray after\ninjecting a radiopaque substance to examine theblood vessels and lymphatics.\nArrhythmia —An irregular heartbeat or action.\nCardiac catheterization —A diagnostic procedure\nthat gives a comprehensive examination of how theheart and its blood vessels function; performed byinserting one or more catheters through a peripheralblood vessel in the arm or leg.\nCoxsackie B virus —A mild virus belonging to a\ngroup of viruses (coxsackievirus) that may producea variety of illnesses, including myocarditis.\nEchocardiography —A noninvasive diagnostic pro-\ncedure that uses ultrasound to examine internal car-diac structures.Electrocardiogram —A record of the electrical activ-\nity of the heart, with each wave being labeled as P,Q, R, S, and T waves. Often used in the diagnosis ofcases of abnormal cardiac rhythm and myocardialdamage.\nHypertensive heart disease —High blood pressure\nresulting in a disease of the heart.\nIschemic heart disease —Insufficient blood supply\nto the heart muscle (myocardium).\nValvular heart disease —A disease of any one of the\nfour valves that controls blood flow into, through,and out of the heart.\nVentricular tachycardia — An abnormally rapid\nheartbeat. It includes a series of at least three beatsarising from a ventricular area at a rate of more than100 beats per minute, usually ranging from 150-200 beats per minute.\nIf severe rhythm disturbances are involved, cardiac assist\ndevices, an “artificial heart,” or heart transplantation\nmay be the only option for complete recovery.\nPrognosis\nThe outlook for a diagnosed case of myocarditis\ncaused by a viral infection is excellent, with many caseshealing themselves spontaneously. Severe or acutemyocarditis may be controlled with medication to pre-vent heart failure. Because this disease may be mild ormay be extreme and cause serious arrhythmias, the prog-nosis varies. Cases of myocarditis may vary from com-plete healing (with or without significant scarring), tosevere congestive heart failure leading to death or\nrequiring a heart transplant.\nInflammation of the myocardium may also cause\nacute pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of\nthe heart). Due to the potential effects of the disease,including sudden death, it is imperative that proper med-ical attention is obtained.\nPrevention\nAlthough myocarditis is an unpredictable disease,\nthe following measures may help prevent its onset. Indi-viduals should:\n• take extra measures to avoid infections, and obtain\nappropriate treatment for infections\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2290Myocarditis• limit alcohol consumption to no more than one or two\ndrinks a day, if any\n• maintain current immunizations against diphtheria ,\ntetanus, measles, rubella , and polio\n• avoid anything that may cause the abnormal heart to\nwork too hard, including salt and vigorous exercise\nResources\nBOOKS\nThe Editors of Time-Life Books.

    "title": "Myoglobin test",
    "content": "Myoglobin test\nDefinition\nMyoglobin is a protein found in muscle. Myoglobin\ntests are done to evaluate a person who has symptoms ofa heart attack (myocardial infarction) or other muscle\ndamage.\nPurpose\nMyoglobin holds oxygen inside heart and skeletal\nmuscle (muscles that attach to and move bones). It iscontinually released into the blood in small amounts dueto normal turnover of muscle cells. Kidneys discard themyoglobin into urine.\nWhen muscle is damaged, as in a heart attack, larger\namounts of myoglobin are released and blood levels riserapidly. Myoglobin is one of the first tests done to deter-mine if a person with chest pain is having a heart attack, as\nit may be one of the first blood tests to become abnormal.\nDamage or injury to skeletal muscle also causes\nmyoglobin to be released into the blood.\nDescription\nHeart attack must be diagnosed quickly. Medica-\ntions to prevent heart damage are effective only within alimited number of hours. Yet, because of their risk forexcessive bleeding, these medications are given onlyafter a diagnosis of heart attack is made.\nMyoglobin is one of several cardiac markers used to\nmake the diagnosis. Cardiac markers are substances inblood whose levels rise in the hours following a heartattack. Increased levels help diagnose a heart attack; per-sistent normal levels rule it out.\nEach cardiac marker rises, peaks, and returns to a\nnormal level according to its own timeline, or diagnosticwindow. Myoglobin is useful because it has the earliestdiagnostic window. It is the first marker to rise after chestpain begins. Myoglobin levels rise within two to threehours, and sometimes as early as 30 minutes. They peakafter six to nine hours. The levels return to normal within24-36 hours.\nAlthough a rise in myoglobin supports a diagnosis\nof heart attack, it is not conclusive. Simultaneous skeletalmuscle damage could also cause the increase. Myoglobinrules out, rather than proves, a diagnosis in the followingway. If myoglobin levels have not risen after more thanfive hours, a heart attack is unlikely. Normal levels in thefirst two to three hours do not rule out an infarction.\nThe myoglobin test is sometimes repeated every one\nto two hours to watch for the rise and peak. Results areavailable within 30 minutes.\nMyoglobin in large amounts is toxic to the kidney.\nWhen a person has high amounts of myoglobin in theblood, kidney function must be monitored.\nPreparation\nThis test requires 5 ml of blood. Collection of the\nsample takes only a few minutes. A urine myoglobin testrequires 1 ml of urine collected into a urine collection cup.\nAftercare\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to thepuncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site relieve discomfort.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2291Myoglobin testNormal results\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and\nmethod used.\nAbnormal results\nMyoglobin levels and levels of other cardiac mark-\ners are usually considered before finally confirming adiagnosis of heart attack. A level that has doubled afterone to two hours, even if the level is still in the normalrange, indicates a significant rise that may be due to heartattack.\nIncreased levels are also found with skeletal muscle\ndamage or disease, such as an injury, muscular dystro-\nphy, or polymyositis . Myoglobin levels also rise during\nrenal failure because kidneys lose their ability to clearmyoglobin from blood.\nResources\nBOOKS\nWu, Alan, ed. Cardiac Markers.

Myomectomy isthe preferred treatment for symptomatic fibroids inwomen who want to keep their uterus. Larger fibroidsmust be removed with an abdominal incision, but smallfibroids can be taken out using laparoscopy or hys-\nteroscopy .\nPurpose\nA myomectomy can remove uterine fibroids that\nare causing symptoms. It is an alternative to surgicalremoval of the whole uterus ( hysterectomy ). The proce-\ndure can relieve fibroid-induced menstrual symptomsthat have not responded to medication. Myomectomyalso may be an effective treatment for infertility caused\nby the presence of fibroids.\nPrecautions\nThere is a risk that removal of the fibroids may lead\nto such severe bleeding that the uterus itself will have tobe removed. Because of the risk of blood loss during amyomectomy, patients may want to consider bankingtheir own blood before surgery.\nDescription\nUsually, fibroids are buried in the outer wall of the\nuterus and abdominal surgery is required. If they are onthe inner wall of the uterus, uterine fibroids can beremoved using hysteroscopy. If they are on a stalk(pedunculated) on the outer surface of the uterus,laparoscopy can be performed.\nRemoving fibroids through abdominal surgery is a\nmore difficult and slightly more risky operation than ahysterectomy. This is because the uterus bleeds from thesites where the fibroids were, and it may be difficult orimpossible to stop the bleeding. This surgery is usuallyperformed under general anesthesia, although somepatients may be given a spinal or epidural anesthesia.\nThe incision may be horizontal (the “bikini” inci-\nsion) or a vertical incision from the navel downward.After separating the muscle layers underneath the skin,the surgeon makes an opening in the abdominal wall.Next, the surgeon makes an incision over each fibroid,grasping and pulling out each growth.\nEvery opening in the uterine wall is then stitched\nwith sutures. The uterus must be meticulously repaired in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2292Myomectomyorder to eliminate potential sites of bleeding or infection.\nThen, the surgeon sutures the abdominal wall and musclelayers above it with absorbable stitches, and closes theskin with clips or nonabsorbable stitches.\nWhen appropriate, a laparoscopic myomectomy\nmay be performed. In this procedure, the surgeonremoves fibroids with the help of a viewing tube (laparo-scope) inserted into the pelvic cavity through an incisionin the navel. The fibroids are removed through a tinyincision under the navel that is much smaller than the 4or 5 inch opening required for a standard myomectomy.\nIf the fibroids are small and located on the inner sur-\nface of the uterus, they can be removed with a thin tele-scope-like device called a hysteroscope. The hystero-scope is inserted into the vagina through the cervix andinto the uterus. This procedure does not require anyabdominal incision, so hospitalization is shorter.\nPreparation\nSurgeons often recommend hormone treatment with\na drug called leuprolide (Lupron) two to six monthsbefore surgery in order to shrink the fibroids. This makesthe fibroids easier to remove. In addition, Lupron stopsmenstruation, so women who are anemic have an oppor-tunity to build up their blood count . While the drug\ntreatment may reduce the risk of excess blood loss duringsurgery, there is a small risk that temporarily-smallerfibroids might be missed during myomectomy, only toenlarge later after the surgery is completed.\nAftercare\nPatients may need four to six weeks of recovery fol-\nlowing a standard myomectomy before they can return tonormal activities. Women who have had laparoscopic orhysteroscopic myomectomies, however, can leave thehospital the day after surgery and usually recovery com-pletely within two to three days to one to three weeks.\nRisks\nThe risks of a myomectomy performed by a skilled\nsurgeon are about the same as hysterectomy (one of themost common and safest surgeries). Removing multiplefibroids is more difficult and slightly more risky.\nPossible complications include:\n• infection\n• blood loss• the wall of the uterus may be weakened if the removal of\na large fibroid leaves a wound that extends the completethickness of the wall.

    "title": "Myopathies",
    "content": "Myopathies\nDefinition\nMyopathies are diseases of skeletal muscle which\nare not caused by nerve disorders. These diseases causethe skeletal or voluntary muscles to become weak orwasted.\nDescription\nThere are many different types of myopathies, some\nof which are inherited, some inflammatory, and somecaused by endocrine problems. Myopathies are rare andnot usually fatal. Typically, effects are mild, largely caus-ing muscle weakness and movement problems, and manyare transitory. Only rarely will patients become dependenton a wheelchair. However, muscular dystrophy (which\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2293Myopathiesis technically a form of myopathy) is far more severe.\nSome types of this disease are fatal in early adulthood.\nCauses and symptoms\nMyopathies are usually degenerative, but they are\nsometimes caused by drug side effects, chemical poison-\ning, or a chronic disorder of the immune system.\nGenetic myopathies\nAmong their many functions, genes are responsible\nfor overseeing the production of proteins important inmaintaining healthy cells. Muscle cells produce thousandsof proteins. With each of the inherited myopathies, agenetic defect is linked to a lack of, or problem with, oneof the proteins needed for normal muscle cell function.\nThere are several different kinds of myopathy\ncaused by defective genes:\n• central core disease• centronuclear (myotubular) myopathy• myotonia congenita• nemaline myopathy\n• paramyotonia congenita\n• periodic paralysis (hypokalemic and hyperkalemic\nforms)\n• mitochondrial myopathies\nMost of these genetic myopathies are dominant,\nwhich means that a child needs to inherit only one copyof the defective gene from one parent in order to have thedisease. The parent with the defective gene also has thedisorder, and each of this parent’s children has a 50%chance of also inheriting the disease. Male and femalechildren are equally at risk.\nHowever, one form of myotonia congenita and\nsome forms of nemaline myopathy must be inheritedfrom both parents, each of whom carry a recessivedefective gene but who don’t have symptoms of the dis-ease. Each child of such parents has a 25% chance ofinheriting both genes and showing signs of the disease,and a 50% chance of inheriting one defective gene fromonly one parent. If the child inherited just one defectivegene, he or she would be a carrier but would not showsigns of the disease.\nA few forms of centronuclear myopathy develop pri-\nmarily in males. Females who inherit the defective geneare usually carriers without symptoms, like their moth-ers, but they can pass on the disease to their sons. Mito-chondrial myopathies are inherited through the mother,since sperm don’t contain mitochondria. (Mitochondriaplay a key role in energy production in the body’s cells.)The major symptoms associated with the genetic\nmyopathies include:\n• Central core disease: mild weakness of voluntary mus-\ncles, especially in the hips and legs; hip displacement;delays in reaching developmental motor milestones;problems with running, jumping, and climbing stairsdevelop in childhood\n• Centronuclear myopathy: weakness of voluntary mus-\ncles including those on the face, arms, legs, and trunk;drooping upper eyelids; facial weakness; foot drop;affected muscles almost always lack reflexes\n• Myotonia congenita: voluntary muscles of the arms, legs,\nand face are stiff or slow to relax after contracting(myotonia); stiffness triggered by fatigue ,stress , cold, or\nlong rest periods, such as a night’s sleep; stiffness can berelieved by repeated movement of the affected muscles\n• Nemaline myopathy: moderate weakness of voluntary\nmuscles in the arms, legs, and trunk; mild weakness offacial muscles; delays in reaching developmental motormilestones; decreased or absent reflexes in affectedmuscles; long, narrow face; high-arched palate; jawprojects beyond upper part of the face\n• Paramyotonia congenita: stiffness (myotonia) of volun-\ntary muscles in the face, hands, and forearms; attacksspontaneous or triggered by cold temperatures; stiffnessmade worse by repeated movement; episodes of stiff-ness last longer than those seen in myotonia congenita\n• Periodic paralysis: attacks of temporary muscle weak-\nness (muscles work normally between attacks); in thehypokalemic (low calcium) form, attacks triggered byvigorous exercise , heavy meals (high in carbohy-\ndrates), insulin, stress, alcohol, infection, pregnancy ;\nin the hyperkalemic (normal/high calcium) form,attacks triggered by vigorous exercise, stress, pregnan-cy, missing a meal, steroid drugs, high potassium intake\n• Mitochondrial myopathies: symptoms vary quite wide-\nly with the form of the disease and may include pro-gressive weakness of the eye muscles (ocular myopa-thy), weakness of the arms and legs, or multisystemproblems primarily involving the brain and muscles\nEndocrine-related myopathies\nIn some cases, myopathies can be caused by a mal-\nfunctioning gland (or glands), which produces either toomuch or too little of the chemical messengers called hor-mones. Hormones are carried by the blood and one of theirmany functions is to regulate muscle activity. Problems inproducing hormones can lead to muscle weakness.\nHyperthyroid myopathy and hypothyroid myopathy\naffect different muscles in different ways. Hyperthyroid\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2294Myopathiesmyopathy occurs when the thyroid gland produces too\nmuch thyroxine, leading to muscle weakness, some mus-cle wasting in hips and shoulders, and, sometimes, prob-lems with eye muscles. The hypothyroid type occurswhen too little hormone is produced, leading to stiffness,cramps, and weakness of arm and leg muscles.\nInflammatory myopathies\nSome myopathies are inflammatory, leading to\ninflamed, weakened muscles. Inflammation is a protec-tive response of injured tissues characterized by redness,increased heat, swelling, and/or pain in the affected area.\nExamples of this type include polymyositis , dermato-\nmyositis, and myositis ossificans.\nDermatomyositis is a disease of the connective tis-\nsue that also involves weak, tender, inflamed muscles. Infact, muscle tissue loss may be so severe that the personmay be unable to walk. Skin inflammation is also pre-sent. The cause is unknown, but viral infection andantibiotics are associated with the condition. In some\ncases, dermatomyositis is associated with rheumatologicdisease or cancer . Polymyositis involves inflammation\nof many muscles usually accompanied by deformity,swelling, sleeplessness, pain, sweating, and tension. It,too, may be associated with cancer. Myositis ossificans isa rare inherited disease in which muscle tissue isreplaced by bone, beginning in childhood.\nMuscular dystrophy\nWhile considered to be a separate group of diseases,\nthe muscular dystrophies also technically involve musclewasting and can be described as myopathies. These rela-tively rare diseases appear during childhood and adoles-cence, and are caused by muscle destruction or degenera-tion.

    "title": "Myopia",
    "content": "Myopia\nDefinition\nMyopia is the medical term for nearsightedness.\nPeople with myopia see objects more clearly when theyare close to the eye, while distant objects appear blurredor fuzzy. Reading and close-up work may be clear, butdistance vision is blurry.\nDescription\nTo understand myopia it is necessary to have a basic\nknowledge of the main parts of the eye’s focusing sys-tem: the cornea, the lens, and the retina. The cornea is atough, transparent, dome-shaped tissue that covers thefront of the eye (not to be confused with the white,opaque sclera). The cornea lies in front of the iris (thecolored part of the eye). The lens is a transparent, dou-ble-convex structure located behind the iris. The retina isa thin membrane that lines the rear of the eyeball. Light-sensitive retinal cells convert incoming light rays intoelectrical signals that are sent along the optic nerve to thebrain, which then interprets the images.\nIn people with normal vision, parallel light rays\nenter the eye and are bent by the cornea and lens (aprocess called refraction) to focus precisely on the retina,providing a crisp, clear image. In the myopic eye, thefocusing power of the cornea (the major refracting struc-ture of the eye) and the lens is too great with respect tothe length of the eyeball. Light rays are bent too much,and they converge in front of the retina. This inaccuracyis called a refractive error. In other words, an overfo-cused fuzzy image is sent to the brain.\nThere are many types of myopia. Some common\ntypes include:\n• physiologic\n• pathologic• acquired\nBy far the most common form, physiologic myopia\ndevelops in children sometime between the ages of 5-10years and gradually progresses until the eye is fullygrown. Physiologic myopia may include refractivemyopia (the cornea and lens-bending properties are toostrong) and axial myopia (the eyeball is too long). Patho-logic myopia is a far less common abnormality. This con-dition begins as physiologic myopia, but rather than sta-bilizing, the eye continues to enlarge at an abnormal rate(progressive myopia). This more advanced type ofmyopia may lead to degenerative changes in the eye(degenerative myopia). Acquired myopia occurs afterinfancy. This condition may be seen in association withuncontrolled diabetes and certain types of cataracts .\nAntihypertensive drugs and other medications can also\naffect the refractive power of the lens.\nGenetic profile\nEyecare professionals have debated the role of\ngenetics in the development of myopia for many years.Some believe that a tendency toward myopia may beinherited, but the actual disorder results from a combina-tion of environmental and genetic factors. Environmentalfactors include close work; work with computer monitorsor other instruments that emit some light (electron micro-scopes, photographic equipment, lasers, etc.); emotionalstress ; and eye strain.\nA variety of genetic patterns for inheriting myopia\nhave been suggested, ranging from a recessive patternwith complete penetrance in people who are homozygot-ic for myopia to an autosomal dominant pattern; an auto-somal recessive pattern; and various mixtures of thesepatterns. One explanation for this lack of agreement isthat the genetic profile of high myopia (defined as arefractive error greater than -6 diopters) may differ fromthat of low myopia. Some researchers think that highmyopia is determined by genetic factors to a greaterextent than low myopia.\nAnother explanation for disagreement regarding the\nrole of heredity in myopia is the sensitivity of the humaneye to very small changes in its anatomical structure. Sinceeven small deviations from normal structure cause signifi-cant refractive errors, it may be difficult to single out anyspecific genetic or environmental factor as their cause.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2296MyopiaGenetic markers and gene mapping\nSince 1992, genetic markers that may be associated\nwith genes for myopia have been located on human chro-mosomes 1, 2, 12, and 18. There is some genetic informa-tion on the short arm of chromosome 2 in highly myopicpeople. Genetic information for low myopia appears to belocated on the short arm of chromosome 1, but it is notknown whether this information governs the structure ofthe eye itself or vulnerability to environmental factors.\nIn 1998 a team of American researchers presented\nevidence that a gene for familial high myopia with anautosomal dominant transmission pattern could bemapped to human chromosome 18 in eight North Ameri-can families. The same group also found a second locusfor this form of myopia on human chromosome 12 in alarge German/Italian family. In 1999 a group of Frenchresearchers found no linkage between chromosome 18and 32 French families with familial high myopia. Thesefindings have been taken to indicate that more than onegene is involved in the transmission of the disorder.\nFamily studies\nIt has been known for some years that a family histo-\nry of myopia is one of the most important risk factors fordeveloping the condition. Only 6%-15% of children withmyopia come from families in which neither parent ismyopic. In families with one myopic parent, 23%-40%of the children develop myopia. If both parents aremyopic, the rate rises to 33%-60% for their children. OneAmerican study found that children with two myopicparents are 6.42 times as likely to develop myopia them-selves as children with only one or no myopic parents.The precise interplay of genetic and environmental fac-tors in these family patterns, however, is not yet known.\nOne multigenerational study of Chinese subjects\nindicated that subjects in the third generation had a higherrisk of developing myopia even if their parents were notmyopic. The researchers concluded that, at least in China,the genetic factors in myopia have remained constant overthe past three generations while the environmental factorshave intensified. The increase in the percentage of peoplewith myopia over the last 50 years in the United Stateshas led American researchers to the same conclusion.\nMyopia is the most common eye disorder in\nhumans around the world. It affects between 25% and35% of the adult population in the United States and thedeveloped countries, but is thought to affect as much as40% of the population in some parts of Asia. Someresearchers have found slightly higher rates of myopiain women than in men.\nThe age distribution of myopia in the United States\nvaries considerably. Five-year-olds have the lowest rateof myopia (less than 5%) of any age group. The preva-\nlence of myopia rises among children and adolescents inschool until it reaches the 25%-35% mark in the youngadult population. It declines slightly in the over-45 agegroup; about 20% of 65-year-olds have myopia. The fig-ure drops to 14% for Americans over 70.\nOther factors that affect the demographic distribu-\ntion of myopia are income level and education. Theprevalence of myopia is higher among people withabove-average incomes and educational attainments.Myopia is also more prevalent among people whosework requires a great deal of close focusing, includingwork with computers.\nCauses and symptoms\nMyopia is said to be caused by an elongation of the\neyeball. This means that the oblong (as opposed to nor-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2297Myopia\nLight\nNearsightedness (myopia)Cornea\nLensLightRetina\nNormal eye\nMyopia, or nearsightedness, is a condition of the eye in\nwhich objects are seen more clearly when close to the eyewhile distant objects appear blurred or fuzzy. (Illustration by\nElectronic Illustrators Group.)mal spherical) shape of the myopic eye causes the cornea\nand lens to focus at a point in front of the retina. A moreprecise explanation is that there is an inadequate correla-tion between the focusing power of the cornea and lensand the length of the eye.\nPeople are generally born with a small amount of\nhyperopia (farsightedness), but as the eye grows this\ndecreases and myopia does not become evident until later.This change is one reason why some researchers thinkthat myopia is an acquired rather than an inherited trait.\nThe symptoms of myopia are blurred distance vision,\neye discomfort, squinting, and eye strain.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of myopia is typically made during the\nfirst several years of elementary school when a teachernotices a child having difficulty seeing the chalkboard,reading, or concentrating. The teacher or school nurseoften recommends an eye examination by an ophthal-\nmologist or optometrist. An ophthalmologist—M.D. orD.O. (Doctor of Osteopathy)—is a medical doctor trainedin the diagnosis and treatment of eye problems. Ophthal-mologists also perform eye surgery. An optometrist(O.D.) diagnoses and manages and/or treats eye and visu-al disorders. In many states, optometrists are licensed touse diagnostic and therapeutic drugs.\nA patient’s distance vision is tested by reading letters\nor numbers on a chart posted a set distance away (usually20 ft). The doctor asks the patient to view images througha variety of lenses to obtain the best correction. The doc-tor also examines the inside of the eye and the retina. Aninstrument called a slit lamp is used to examine thecornea and lens. The eyeglass prescription is written interms of diopters (D), which measure the degree of refrac-tive error. Mild to moderate myopia usually falls between-1.00D and -6.00D. Normal vision is commonly referredto as 20/20 to describe the eye’s focusing ability at a dis-tance of 20 ft from an object. For example, 20/50 meansthat a myopic person must stand 20 ft away from an eyechart to see what a normal person can see at 50 ft. Thelarger the bottom number, the greater the myopia.\nTreatment\nPeople with myopia have three main options for\ntreatment: eyeglasses, contact lenses, and for those whomeet certain criteria, refractive eye surgery.\nEyeglasses\nEyeglasses are the most common method used to\ncorrect myopia. Concave glass or plastic lenses areplaced in frames in front of the eyes. The lenses are\nground to the thickness and curvature specified in theeyeglass prescription. The lenses cause the light rays todiverge so that they focus further back, directly on theretina, producing clear distance vision.\nContact lenses\nContact lenses are a second option for treatment.\nContact lenses are extremely thin round discs of plasticthat are worn on the eye in front of the cornea. Althoughthere may be some initial discomfort, most people quick-ly grow accustomed to contact lenses. Hard contact lens-es, made from a material called PMMA, are virtuallyobsolete. Rigid gas permeable lenses (RGP) are made ofplastic that holds its shape but allows the passage ofsome oxygen into the eye. Some believe that RGP lensesmay halt or slow the progression of myopia because theymaintain a constant, gentle pressure that flattens thecornea. As of 2001, the National Eye Institute is conduct-ing an ongoing study of RGP lenses called the ContactLens and Myopia Progression (CLAMP) Study, withresults to be published in 2003.\nA procedure called orthokeratology acts on this\nprinciple of “corneal molding.” However, when contactlenses are discontinued for a period of time, the corneawill generally go back to its original shape. Rigid gaspermeable lenses offer crisp, clear, sight. Soft contactlenses are made of flexible plastic and can be up to 80%water. Soft lenses offer increased comfort and the advan-tage of extended wear; some can be worn continuouslyfor up to one week. While oxygen passes freely throughsoft lenses, bacterial contamination and other problemscan occur, requiring replacement of lenses on a regularbasis. It is very important to follow the cleaning and dis-infecting regimens prescribed because protein and lipidbuildup can occur on the lenses, causing discomfort orincreasing the risk of infection. Contact lenses offer sev-eral benefits over glasses, including: better vision, lessdistortion, clear peripheral vision, and cosmetic appeal.In addition, contacts don’t steam up from perspiration orchanges in temperature.\nRefractive eye surgery\nFor people who find glasses and contact lenses\ninconvenient or uncomfortable, and who meet selectioncriteria regarding age, degree of myopia, general health,etc., refractive eye surgery is a third treatment alternative.There are three types of corrective surgeries available asof 2001: 1) radial keratotomy (RK), 2) photorefractive\nkeratectomy (PRK), and 3) laser-assisted in-situ ker-atomileusis (LASIK), which is still under clinical evalua-tion by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Refrac-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2298Myopiative eye surgery improves myopic vision by permanently\nchanging the shape of the cornea so that light rays focusproperly on the retina. These procedures are performed onan outpatient basis and generally take 10-30 minutes.\nRADIAL KERATOTOMY. Radial keratotomy (RK), the\nfirst of these procedures made available, has a high asso-ciated risk. It was first developed in Japan and the SovietUnion, and introduced into the United States in 1978.The surgeon uses a delicate diamond-tipped blade, amicroscope, and microscopic instruments to make sever-al spoke-like “radial” incisions in the non-viewing(peripheral) portion of the cornea. As the incisions heal,the slits alter the curve of the cornea, making it more flat,which may improve the focus of images onto the retina.KEY TERMS\nAccommodation —The ability of the lens to change\nits focus from distant to near objects. It is achievedthrough the action of the ciliary muscles thatchange the shape of the lens.\nCornea —The transparent structure of the eye over\nthe lens that is continous with the sclera in formingthe outermost, protective, layer of the eye.\nDiopter (D) —A unit of measure for describing\nrefractive power.\nLaser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) —A\nprocedure that uses a cutting tool and a laser tomodify the cornea and correct moderate to highlevels of myopia.\nLens—The transparent, elastic, curved structure\nbehind the iris (colored part of the eye) that helpsfocus light on the retina.\nOphthalmologist —A physician specializing in the\nmedical and surgical treatment of eye disorders.\nOptic nerve —A bundle of nerve fibers that carries\nvisual messages from the retina in the form of elec-trical signals to the brain.\nOptometrist —A medical professional who exam-\nines and tests the eyes for disease and treats visualdisorders by prescribing corrective lenses and/orvision therapy. In many states, optometrists arelicensed to use diagnostic and therapeutic drugs totreat certain ocular diseases.\nOrthokeratology —A method of reshaping the\ncornea using a contact lens. It is not considered apermanent method to reduce myopia.Peripheral vision —The ability to see objects that are\nnot located directly in front of the eye. Peripheralvision allows people to see objects located on theside or edge of their field of vision.\nPhotorefractive keratectomy (PRK) —A procedure\nthat uses an excimer laser to make modifications tothe cornea and permanently correct myopia. As ofearly 1998, only two lasers have been approved bythe FDA for this purpose.\nRadial keratotomy (RK) —A surgical procedure\ninvolving the use of a diamond-tipped blade tomake several spoke-like slits in the peripheral (non-viewing) portion of the cornea to improve the focusof the eye and correct myopia by flattening thecornea.\nRefraction —The bending of light rays as they pass\nfrom one medium through another. Used todescribe the action of the cornea and lens on lightrays as they enter the eye. Also used to describe thedetermination and measurement of the eye’s focus-ing system by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.\nRefractive eye surgery —A general term for surgical\nprocedures that can improve or correct refractiveerrors by permanently changing the shape of thecornea.\nRetina —The light-sensitive layer of tissue in the\nback of the eye that receives and transmits visualsignals to the brain through the optic nerve.\nVisual acuity —The ability to distinguish details and\nshapes of objects.\nPHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY. Photorefractive\nkeratectomy (PRK) involves the use of a computer to mea-sure the shape of the cornea. Using these measurements,the surgeon applies a computer-controlled laser to makemodifications to the cornea. The PRK procedure flattensthe cornea by vaporizing small amounts of tissue from thecornea’s surface. As of early 2001, only two excimer lasersare approved by the FDA for PRK, although other lasershave been used. It is important to make sure the laserbeing used is FDA approved. Photorefractive keratectomycan be used to treat mild to moderate forms of myopia.The cost is approximately $2,000 per eye.\nLASER-ASSISTED IN-SITU KERATOMILEUSIS. Laser-\nassisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the newest of\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2299Myopiathese procedures. It is recommended for moderate to\nsevere cases of myopia. A variation on the PRK method,LASIK uses lasers and a cutting tool called a microker-atome to cut a circular flap on the cornea. The flap isflipped back to expose the inner layers of the cornea. Thecornea is treated with a laser to change the shape andfocusing properties, then the flap is replaced.\nRisks\nAll of these surgical procedures carry risks, the most\nserious being corneal scarring, corneal rupture, infection,cataracts, and loss of vision. In addition, a study pub-lished in March 2001 warns that mountain climbers whohave had LASIK surgery should be aware of possiblechanges in their vision at high altitudes. The lack of oxy-gen at high altitudes causes temporary changes in thethickness of the cornea.\nSince refractive eye surgery doesn’t guarantee 20/20\nvision, it is important to have realistic expectationsbefore choosing this treatment. In a 10-year study con-ducted by the National Eye Institute between 1983 and1993, over 50% of people with radial keratotomy gained20/20 vision, and 85% passed a driving test (requiring20/40 vision) after surgery, without glasses or contactlenses. Even if the patient gains near-perfect vision, how-ever, there are potentially irritating side effects, such aspostoperative pain , poor night vision, variation in visual\nacuity, light sensitivity and glare, and optical distortion.Refractive eye surgeries are considered elective proce-dures and are rarely covered by insurance plans.\nMyopia treatments under research include corneal\nimplants and permanent surgically placed contact lenses.\nAlternative treatments\nSome eye care professionals recommend treatments\nto help improve circulation, reduce eye strain, and relaxthe eye muscles. It is possible that by combining exerciseswith changes in behavior, the progression of myopia maybe slowed or prevented. Alternative treatments include:visual therapy (also referred to as vision training or eye\nexercises); discontinuing close work; reducing eye strain(taking a rest break during periods of prolonged nearvision tasks); and wearing bifocals to decrease the need toaccommodate when doing close-up work.\nPrognosis\nGlasses and contact lenses can (but not always) cor-\nrect the patient’s vision to 20/20. Refractive surgery canmake permanent improvements for the right candidates.\nWhile the genetic factors that influence the transmis-\nsion and severity of myopia cannot be changed, some envi-ronmental factors can be modified. They include reducing\nclose work; reading and working in good light; taking fre-quent breaks when working at a computer or microscopefor long periods of time; maintaining good nutrition ; and\npracticing visual therapy (when recommended).\nEye strain can be prevented by using sufficient light\nfor reading and close work, and by wearing correctivelenses as prescribed. Everyone should have regular eyeexaminations to see if their prescription has changed or ifany other problems have developed. This is particularlyimportant for people with high (degenerative) myopiawho are at a greater risk of developing retinal detach-\nment , retinal degeneration, glaucoma , or other problems.\nResources\nBOOKS\nBirnbaum, Martin H.

    "content": "Myotonic dystrophy\nDefinition\nMyotonic dystrophy is a progressive disease in\nwhich the muscles are weak and are slow to relax aftercontraction.\nDescription\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM), also called dystrophia\nmyotonica, myotonia atrophica, or Steinert disease, is acommon form of muscular dystrophy . DM is an inherit-\ned disease, affecting males and females approximatelyequally. About 30,000 people in the United States areaffected. Symptoms may appear at any time from infancyto adulthood. DM causes general weakness, usuallybeginning in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face.It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups,including the heart. DM affects a wide variety of otherorgan systems as well.\nA severe form of DM, congenital myotonic dystro-\nphy, may appear in newborns of mothers who have DM.Congenital means that the condition is present from birth.\nDM occurs in about 1 of 20,000 people and has been\ndescribed in people from all over the world.\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common type of DM is called DM1 and is\ncaused by a mutation in a gene called myotonic dystro-phy protein kinase (DMPK). The DMPK gene is locatedon chromosome 19. When there is a mutation in thisgene, a person develops DM1. The specific mutation thatcauses DM1 is called a trinucleotide repeat expansion.Some families with symptoms of DM do not have a\nmutation in the DMPK gene. As of early 2001, scientistshave found that the DM in many of these families iscaused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 3. How-ever the specific gene and mutation have not yet beenidentified. These families are said to have DM2.\nTrinucleotide repeats\nIn the DMPK gene, there is a section of the genetic\ncode where the three letters CTG are repeated a certainnumber of times. In people who have DM1, this word isrepeated too many times—more than the normal numberof 37 times—and thus this section of the gene is too big.This enlarged section of the gene is called a trinucleotiderepeat expansion.\nPeople who have repeat numbers in the normal\nrange will not develop DM1 and cannot pass it to theirchildren. Having more than 50 repeats causes DM1. Peo-ple who have 38–49 repeats have a premutation and willnot develop DM1, but can pass DM1 onto their children.Having repeats numbers greater than 1,000 causes con-genital myotonic dystrophy.\nIn general, the more repeats in the affected range\nthat someone has, the earlier the age of onset of symp-toms and the more severe the symptoms. However, this isa general rule. It is not possible to look at a person’srepeat number and predict at what age they will begin tohave symptoms or how their condition will progress.\nExactly how the trinucleotide repeat expansion caus-\nes myotonia, the inability to relax muscles, is not yetunderstood. The disease somehow blocks the flow ofelectrical impulses across the muscle cell membrane.Without proper flow of charged particles, the musclecannot return to its relaxed state after it has contracted.\nAnticipation\nSometimes when a person who has repeat numbers\nin the affected or premutation range has children, theexpansion grows larger. This is called anticipation. Alarger expansion can result in an earlier age of onset inchildren than in their affected parent. Anticipation hap-pens more often when a mother passes DM1 onto herchildren then when it is passed from the father. Occa-sionally repeat sizes stay the same or even get smallerwhen they are passed to a person’s children.\nInheritance\nDM is inherited through autosomal dominant\ninheritance. This means that equal numbers of malesand females are affected. It also means that only onegene in the pair needs to have the mutation in order for\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2301Myotonic dystrophya person to be affected. Since a person only passes one\ncopy of each gene onto their children, there is a 50% orone in two chance that a person who has DM will passit onto each of their children. This percentage is notchanged by results of other pregnancies. A person witha premutation also has a 50%, or one in two, chance ofpassing the altered gene on to each of their children.However, whether or not their children will developDM1 depends on whether the trinucleotide repeatbecomes further expanded. A person who has repeatnumbers in the normal range cannot pass DM1 ontotheir children.\nThere is a range in the severity of symptoms in DM\nand not everyone will have all of the symptoms listed here.\nMyotonic dystrophy causes weakness and delayed\nmuscle relaxation called myotonia. Symptoms of DMinclude facial weakness and a slack jaw, drooping eye-lids called ptosis , and muscle wasting in the forearms\nand calves. A person with DM has difficulty relaxinghis or her grasp, especially in the cold. DM affects theheart muscle, causing irregularities in the heartbeat. Italso affects the muscles of the digestive system, caus-ing constipation and other digestive problems. DM\nmay cause cataracts , retinal degeneration, low IQ,\nfrontal balding, skin disorders, atrophy of the testicles,and diabetes. It can also cause sleep apnea—a condi-tion in which normal breathing is interrupted duringsleep. DM increases the need for sleep and decreasesmotivation. Severe disabilities do not set in until about20 years after symptoms begin. Most people withmyotonic dystrophy maintain the ability to walk, evenlate in life.\nA severe form of DM, congenital myotonic dystro-\nphy, may appear in newborns of mothers who haveDM1. Congenital myotonic dystrophy is marked bysevere weakness, poor sucking and swallowing respons-es, respiratory difficulty, delayed motor development,and mental retardation . Death in infancy is common\nin this type.\nSome people who have a trinucleotide repeat expan-\nsion in their DMPK gene do not have symptoms or havevery mild symptoms that go unnoticed. It is not unusualfor a woman to be diagnosed with DM after she has aninfant with congenital myotonic dystrophy.\nPredictive testing\nIt is possible to test someone who is at risk for devel-\noping DM1 before they are showing symptoms to seewhether they inherited an expanded trinucleotide repeat.This is called predictive testing. Predictive testing cannotdetermine the age of onset that someone will begin tohave symptoms, or the course of the disease.Diagnosis\nDiagnosis of DM is not difficult once the disease is\nconsidered. However, the true problem may be maskedbecause symptoms can begin at any age, can be mild orsevere, and can occur with a wide variety of associatedcomplaints. Diagnosis of DM begins with a careful med-ical history and a thorough physical exam to determinethe distribution of symptoms and to rule out other causes.A family history of DM or unexplained weakness helpsto establish the diagnosis.\nA definitive diagnosis of DM1 is done by genetic\ntesting , usually by taking a small amount of blood. The\nDNA in the blood cells is examined and the number ofrepeats in the DMPK gene is determined. Various othertests may be done to help establish the diagnosis, but onlyrarely would other testing be needed. An electromyogram(EMG) is a test used to examine the response of the mus-cles to stimulation. Characteristic changes are seen in DMthat helps distinguish it from other muscle diseases.Removing a small piece of muscle tissue for microscopicexamination is called a muscle biopsy. DM is marked bycharacteristic changes in the structure of muscle cells thatcan be seen on a muscle biopsy. An electrocardiogramcould be performed to detect characteristic abnormalitiesin heart rhythm associated with DM. These symptomsoften appear later in the course of the disease.\nPrenatal testing\nTesting a pregnancy to determine whether an\nunborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in afamily has identified a DMPK mutation. This can bedone at 10–12 weeks gestation by a procedure calledchorionic villus sampling (CVS) that involves removing\na tiny piece of the placenta and analyzing DNA from itscells. It can also be done by amniocentesis after 14\nweeks gestation by removing a small amount of theamniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing thecells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a smallrisk of miscarriage associated with it and those who are\ninterested in learning more should check with their doc-tor or genetic counselor.\nThere is also another procedure, called preimplanta-\ntion diagnosis that allows a couple to have a child that isunaffected with the genetic condition in their family.This procedure is experimental and not widely available.Those interested in learning more about this procedureshould check with their doctor or genetic counselor.\nTreatment\nMyotonic dystrophy cannot be cured, and no treat-\nment can delay its progression. However, many of the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2302Myotonic dystrophysymptoms it causes can be treated. Physical therapy can\nhelp preserve or increase strength and flexibility in mus-cles. Ankle and wrist braces can be used to supportweakened limbs. Occupational therapy is used to developtools and techniques to compensate for loss of strengthand dexterity. A speech-language pathologist can provideretraining for weakness in the muscles controlling speechand swallowing.\nIrregularities in the heartbeat may be treated with\nmedication or a pacemaker. A yearly electrocardiogramis usually recommended to monitor the heartbeat. Dia-\nbetes mellitus in DM is treated in the same way that it is\nin the general population. A high-fiber diet can help pre-vent constipation. Sleep apnea may be treated with sur-\ngical procedures to open the airways or with nighttimeventilation. Treatment of sleep apnea may reduce drowsi-ness. Lens replacement surgery is available whencataracts develop. Pregnant women should be followedby an obstetrician familiar with the particular problemsof DM because complications can occur during pregnan-cy, labor and delivery.\nWearing a medical bracelet is advisable. Some\nemergency medications may have dangerous effects onthe heart rhythm in a person with DM. Adverse reactionsto general anesthesia may also occur.\nPrognosis\nThe course of myotonic dystrophy varies. When\nsymptoms appear earlier in life, disability tends tobecome more severe. Occasionally people with DM mayrequire a wheelchair later in life. Children with congeni-tal DM usually require special educational programs andphysical and occupational therapy. For both types ofDM, respiratory infections pose a danger when weaknessbecomes severe.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\nThe International Myotonic Dystrophy Consortium (IDMC).\n“New nomenclature and DNA testing guidelines formyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).” Neurology 54(2000):\n1218–1221.\nMeola, Giovanni. “Myotonic Dystrophies.” Current Opinion in\nNeurology 13 (2000): 519–525.\nORGANIZATIONS\nMuscular Dystrophy Association. 3300 East Sunrise Dr., Tuc-\nson, AZ 85718.

    "title": "Myringotomy and ear tubes",
    "content": "Myringotomy and ear tubes\nDefinition\nMyringotomy is a surgical procedure in which a\nsmall incision is made in the eardrum (the tympanicmembrane), usually in both ears. The word comes frommyringa, modern Latin for drum membrane, and\ntom&emacr;, Greek for cutting. It is also called myringo-\ncentesis, tympanotomy, tympanostomy, or paracentesis\nof the tympanic membrane. Fluid in the middle ear canbe sucked out through the incision.\nEar tubes, or tympanostomy tubes, are small tubes,\nopen at both ends, that are inserted into the incisions inthe eardrums during myringotomy. They come in variousshapes and sizes and are made of plastic, metal, or both.They are left in place until they fall out by themselves oruntil they are removed by a doctor.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2303Myringotomy and ear tubesPurpose\nMyringotomy with the insertion of ear tubes is an\noptional treatment for inflammation of the middle earwith fluid collection (effusion), also called glue ear, thatlasts more than three months (chronic otitis media with\neffusion) and does not respond to drug treatment. It is therecommended treatment if the condition lasts four to sixmonths. Effusion is the collection of fluid that escapesfrom blood vessels or the lymphatic system. In this case,the fluid collects in the middle ear.\nInitially, acute inflammation of the middle ear with\neffusion is treated with one or two courses of antibiotics .\nAntihistamines and decongestants have been used, but\nthey have not been proven effective unless there is alsohay fever or some other allergic inflammation that con-\ntributes to the problem. Myringotomy with or withoutthe insertion of ear tubes is NOT recommended for initialtreatment of otherwise healthy children with middle earinflammation with effusion.\nIn about 10% of children, the effusion lasts for three\nmonths or longer, when the disease is considered chronic.In children with chronic disease, systemic steroids mayhelp, but the evidence is not clear, and there are risks.\nWhen medical treatment doesn’t stop the effusion\nafter three months in a child who is one to three years old,is otherwise healthy, and has hearing loss in both ears,myringotomy with insertion of ear tubes becomes an\noption. If the effusion lasts for four to six months,myringotomy with insertion of ear tubes is recommended.\nThe purpose of myringotomy is to relieve symp-\ntoms, to restore hearing, to take a sample of the fluid toexamine in the laboratory in order to identify anymicroorganisms present, or to insert ear tubes.\nEar tubes can be inserted into the incision during\nmyringotomy and left there. The eardrum heals aroundthem, securing them in place. They usually fall out ontheir own in 6-12 months or are removed by a doctor.\nWhile they are in place, they keep the incision from\nclosing, keeping a channel open between the middle earand the outer ear. This allows fresh air to reach the mid-dle ear, allowing fluid to drain out, and preventing pres-sure from building up in the middle ear. The patient’shearing returns to normal immediately and the risk ofrecurrence diminishes.\nParents often report that children talk better, hear\nbetter, are less irritable, sleep better, and behave betterafter myringotomy with the insertion of ear tubes.\nDescription\nThe procedure is usually done in an ambulatory sur-\ngical unit under general anesthesia, although some physi-\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2304Myringotomy and ear tubes\nEar drumEustachian tube\nTube\nThe insertion of ear tubes in the eardrum helps to alleviate chronic middle ear infections. (Illustration by Argosy, Inc.)cians do it in the office with sedation and local anesthe-\nsia, especially in older children. The ear is washed, asmall incision made in the eardrum, the fluid sucked out,a tube inserted, and the ear packed with cotton to controlbleeding.\nThere has been an effort to design ear tubes that are\neasier to insert or to remove, and to design tubes that stayin place longer. Therefore, ear tubes come in variousshapes and sizes.\nPreparation\nThe child may not have food or water for four to six\nhours before anesthesia. Antibiotics are usually not needed.\nAftercare\nUse of antimicrobial drops is controversial. Water\nshould be kept out of the ear canal until the eardrum isintact. A doctor should be notified if the tubes fall out.\nRisks\nThe risks include:\n• cutting the outer ear\n• formation at the myringotomy site of granular nodes\ndue to inflammation\n• formation of a mass of skin cells and cholesterol in the\nmiddle ear that can grow and damage surrounding bone(cholesteatoma)\n• permanent perforation of the eardrum\nThe risk of persistent discharge from the ear (otor-\nrhea) is 13%.\nIf the procedure is repeated, structural changes in the\neardrum can occur, such as loss of tone (flaccidity),shrinkage or retraction, or hardening of a spot on theeardrum (typmanosclerosis). The risk of hardening is51%; its effects on hearing aren’t known, but they areprobably insignificant.\nIt is possible that the incision won’t heal properly,\nleaving a permanent hole in the eardrum, which can causesome hearing loss and increases the risk of infection.\nIt is also possible that the ear tube will move inward\nand get trapped in the middle ear, rather than move outinto the external ear, where it either falls out on its ownor can be retrieved by a doctor. The exact incidence oftubes moving inward is not known, but it could increasethe risk of further episodes of middle-ear inflammation,inflammation of the eardrum or the part of the skulldirectly behind the ear, formation of a mass in the middleear, or infection due to the presence of a foreign body.KEY TERMS\nAcute otitis media —Inflammation of the middle\near with signs of infection lasting less than threemonths.\nChronic otitis media —Inflammation of the middle\near with signs of infection lasting three months orlonger.\nEffusion —The escape of fluid from blood vessels\nor the lymphatic system and its collection in acavity, in this case, the middle ear.\nMiddle ear —The cavity or space between the\neardrum and the inner ear.

As many\nas 30% of children undergoing myringotomy with inser-tion of ear tubes need to undergo another procedure with-in five years.\nThe other risks include those associated with seda-\ntives or general anesthesia.\nAn additional element of post-operative care is the\nrecommendation by many doctors that the child use earplugs to keep water out of the ear during bathing orswimming, to reduce the risk of infection and discharge.\nResources\nBOOKS\nLim, David J., ed., et al.

    "title": "Myxoma",
    "content": "Myxoma\nDefinition\nA myxoma is a rare, usually noncancerous, primary\ntumor (a new growth of tissue) of the heart. It is the mostcommon of all benign heart tumors.\nDescription\nMyxoma is an intracardiac tumor; it is found inside the\nheart. Seventy five percent of all myxomas are found in theleft atrium, and almost all other myxomas are found in theright atrium. It is very rare for a myxoma to be found ineither of the ventricles. The tumor takes one of two generalshapes: a round, firm mass, or an irregular shaped, soft,gelatinous mass. They are attached to the endocardium, theinside lining of the heart. The cells that make up the tumorare spindle-shaped cells and are embedded in a matrix richin mucopolysaccharides (a group of carbohydrates). Myxo-mas may contain calcium, which shows up on x rays. Thetumor gets its blood supply from capillaries that bringblood from the heart to the tumor. Thrombi (blood clots)may be attached to the outside of the myxoma.\nThere are three major syndromes linked to myxo-\nmas: embolic events, obstruction of blood flow, and con-stitutional syndromes. Embolic events happen whenfragments of the tumor, or the thrombi attached to theoutside of the tumor, are released and enter the bloodstream. Gelatinous myxomas are more likely to embolizethan the more firm form of this tumor.\nMyxomas may also obstruct blood flow in the heart,\nusually at a heart valve. The mitral valve is the heartvalve most commonly affected. Blood flow restrictionscan lead to pulmonary congestion and heart valve dis-ease. Embolization can lead to severe consequences. Incases of left atrial myxoma, 40-50% of patients experi-ence embolization. Emboli usually end up in the brain,kidneys, and extremities.\nThe third syndrome linked to myxomas are called\nconstitutional syndromes, nonspecific symptoms causedby the myxoma.Causes and symptoms\nThere is no known causative agent for myxoma. The\nmain symptoms, if any, produced by myxoma are genericand not specific. These include fever , weight loss, ane-\nmia, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreasedplatelet count and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Most\npatients with myxoma are between 30-60 years of age.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made following a suspicion that a myx-\noma might be present, and can usually be confirmed byechocardiogram.\nTreatment\nSurgery is used to remove the tumor. Myxomas can\nregrow if they are not completely removed. The survivalrate for this operation is excellent.\nPrognosis\nSuccessful removal of the tumor rids the patient of\nthis disease. Emboli from a myxoma may survive in otherareas of the body. However, there is no evidence that myx-oma is truly metastatic (able to transfer disease from onearea to another), causing tumors in other areas of the body.\nResources\nBOOKS\nAlexander, R. W., R.
